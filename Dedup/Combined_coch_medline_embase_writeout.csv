endoscopic therapy for obesity.retrospective studies have demonstrated its safety and efficacy, and the technique has gained global adoption methods: adults (body mass index 30-40 kg/m2) were randomized 1:1.5 using stratified permuted blocks to receive moderate-intensity lifestyle modification plus esg (esg) or moderate-intensity lifestyle modification alone (ls) for 52 weeks. 9 us centers participated (5 gastroenterology (gi), 4 bariatric surgery) from academic and community practices.esg patients were followed for 104 weeks to assess durability.those randomized to ls crossed-over to esg after 52 weeks. primary objectives were to determine if esg achieves a priori thresholds defined by a 2011 joint gi and surgical society consensus statement and included:1) mean excess weight loss (ewl) of more than 25 in the esg arm at 52 weeks with a 15 ewl difference compared to ls 2) device or procedure-related serious adverse event(sae) rate of 5.modified intention to treat analysis (mitt) using mixed effects model was performed results: 208 patients were randomized esg (n85) or ls (123), of whom 77 and 110 patients underwent the esg procedure or initiated the ls program, respectively, and were included in the mitt analysis.esg resulted in 44.7 95 ci 38.8 - 50.7 more ewl compared to moderate-intensity ls intervention alone (p0.001) at 52 weeks,representing a 12.6 95 ci 10.9 - 14.1 difference in total body weight loss (tbwl) between the two groups (p0.001)(figure 1).at 104 weeks, the esg cohort maintained 91 of the weight lost at week 52, averaging 12.4/-8.4 tbwl. 72 patients from the ls cohort crossed over to esg at 52 weeks.the cross-over cohort achieved an additional 44.1/- 27 ewl compared to the weight loss achieved after 52 weeks of ls alone (p0.001) (figure 1).esg resulted in significant improvement in type ii dm, hypertension,and metabolic syndrome compared to ls (table 1).homa-ir (homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance) significantly improved at 52 in the esg cohort (p0.002) vs. worsened in the ls cohort.among patients with hba1c 6.5 at baseline (n25) who underwent esg, the mean hba1c improvement at 52 weeks was 1.65 (p0.004).esg did not worsen gastroesophageal reflux disease on standardized questionnaires and resulted in significant improvement in quality of life, eating behaviors, and depression.the majority (80) of esg patients would definitely recommend the esg to a friend or family member suffering from obesity. in the esg cohort, no mortality was reported, and the rate of sae was 2 (3/149) with none requiring surgical interventions, blood transfusion, or intensive care, and all resolving without sequelea. conclusion(s): esg is ready for expanded clinical adoption to augment the spectrum of obesity and metabolic

6,actrn,early postoperative enteral feeding in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer,2010,,cn-02433336,"intervention: postoperative enteral feeding plus standard postoperative diet. during surgery an enteral feeding tube will be inserted through the patients nose into their small bowel. the location of the feeding tube is checked by the surgeon via palpation intra_operatively, as well as by plain x_ray postoperatively. a standard fibre containing enteral nutrition formula (4.2kj/ml) will be fed through the nasojejunal tube postoperatively. feeding will commence at a rate of 40mls/hr 4 hours after return to ward after surgery. feeds will remain at this rate for the first 24 hours. the following day, feed rates will be increased to an individualised goal. the goal of enteral nutrition is to provide patients with 125 kilojoules per kilogram of body weight (adjusted using standard methodology for overweight patients). patients randomised to early postoperative enteral feeding will be monitored daily by a nutritionist and will have their diet modified accordingly. patients randomised to postoperative enteral feeding can also commence standard postoperative diet on return to ward. this usually involves sips of water and clear fluid commencing on the return to the ward after surgery. this standard diet may vary slightly from institution to institution. condition: postoperative enteral feeding primary epithelial ovarian cancer primary fallopian tube cancer primary peritoneal cancer moderate malnourishment severe malnourishment primary outcome: quality of life. this study will use the fact_o, an ovarian cancer specific quality of life measurement. this questionnaire will be completed by patients at baseline, and at follow up 1 _ 6 weeks after surgery, and follow up 2 _ 30 days following the thirds cycle of postoperative chemotherapy. the fact_o is an ovarian cancer subscale that has been constructed to complement the fact_g, addressing relevant disease, treatment, or condition related issues not already convered in the general fact_g questionnaire. each is intended to be as specific as necessary to capture the clinically relevant problems associated with a given condition or symptom, yet general enough to allow for comparison across diseases, and extension, as appropriate to other chronic medical conditions. the fact_g was developed by the centre on outcomes, research and education (core) to determine the quality of life of cancer patients, and the functional assessment of cancer therapy (fact_g). the fact_o is a widely utilized quality of life questionnaire. it is a self_report scale and allows patients to rate their current physical, functional, social/family, and emotional well_being. treatment costs and cost effectiveness. the purpose of the analysis is to estimate the length of stay in the hospital and the difference in cost outcomes between the two arms. patients in the control arm will have some observed length of stay in hospital. patients in the intervention arm will incur the marginal costs of the feeding and will have some observed length of stay in hospital. the question we seek to address is whether the cost of the feeding is offset by the cost savings from any reductions in length of stay in hospital. the difference in costs between the two groups will be expressed as: ( cost of feeding cost of hospital stay for feeding group) less ( cost of hospital stay for controls) secondary outcome: delay and dose reductions of chemotherapy. all medication administered to the patient is recorded on a case report form for the time period of randomisation through to 1 month following 3rd cycle of chemotherapy postoperatively. all medication administered to the patient is recorded on a case report form for the time period of randomisation through to 1 month following 3rd cycle of chemotherapy postoperatively. a model will be built that describes cost outcomes for each group, and these will be expressed as probability distributions. the costs of feeding will be recorded for each participant of the intervention arm and either a normal or lognormal distribution fit ed to these data. the length of stay in hospital will be recorded for all participants and gamma distributions fitted for the intervention and the control groups using the method of moments approach. ten thousand random re_samples (bootstrapping) will then be taken from the distributions and the resulting posterior distribution estimated. this technique provides us with robust estimates. this will indicate the mean difference in dollar cost and then the probability that the difference is negative can be calculated. negative costs imply the intervention is cost saving and positive costs imply the opposite. we assume long term patient outcomes are similar or no worse for feeding, and any adverse event, such as infection, will be captured by longer stays in hospital for the control group. the relevant cost outcome is the opportunity cost of a bed day and this can be valued in dollar terms outside of any statistical processes. valuations will be informed by observing current levels of expenditure on hospital services by state health services, these data can be obtained easily from routine data published by the australian institute of health and welfare. start and finish dates for postoperative chemotherapy is recorded on case report forms and entered onto the trial database. trial coordinators access medical correspondence regarding start times for chemotherapy and any reasons for delays in commencement of chemotherapy will be recorded. medical notes for the duration of the chemotherapy schedule are accessed along with the dosages of chemotherapy given with each cycle. any reasons for dosage reductions or interruptions to chemotherapy administration are noted on case report forms. intravenous treatment requirements. intravenous treatments are ordered on medication sheets and then this information is transcribed onto the case report form by the trial coordinator and then entered onto the trial database. length of stay in an intensive care unit or high dependency unit and overall lengh of stay in hospital. need for inotropic medication. inotropic medication _ given to support patient blood pressure and kidney function _ is typically given during the surgery or day 1 or 2 postoperatively. these medications are ordered on medication sheets and then this information is transcribed onto the case report form by the trial coordinator and then entered onto the trial database. nutritional status 6 weeks after surgery. scored patient_generated subjective global assessment (pg_sga) the scored pg_sga is also a validated nutritional assessment tool and has been specifically developed for patients with cancer. the tool consists of a medical history component, which provides information about weight change, dietary intake, gastrointestinal symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea that have persisted for two weeks) and changes in functional capacity. loss of subcutaneous fat, muscle wasting, oedema and ascites will be considered in the physical examination. based on the global assessment, the patient will be classified as category a (well nourished), category b (moderately or suspected malnourished) or category c (severely malnourished). in addition to the global ratings, the scored pg_sga also incorporates a numerical score (pg_sga score). for the overall pg_sga score all point values for each section (patients history, physical examination) of the pg_sga will be added. the additive pg_sga score ranges from 0 to 50 with a higher score reflecting a greater risk of malnutrition. the pg_sga score also provides cut_off scores for appropriate nutritional triage and intervention to improve symptom management. the pg_sga has been accepted by the oncology nutrition dietetic practice group of the american dietetic association as the standard for nutrition assessment for patients with cancer. treatment related adverse events. any adverse change in health or side effect that occurs in a participant in this clinical trial while they are receiving enteral feeds, or from the the day of randomisation and up to one month after their third cycle of chemotherapy will be recorded. any event not present prior to treatment or any event already present that worsens in intensity or frequency will be recorded on a case report form and graded in severity using the national cancer institute common terminology criteria for adverse events version 3.0. adverse events will be documented at each study visit. patients will be questioned regarding medically related change in their condition, and information will be gathered from data collected or communication with doctors or hospitals. inclusion criteria: patients requiring planned upfront or interval cytoreductive surgery for suspected or histologically proven advanced ovarian, primary peritoneal cancer or fallopian tube cancer as determined jointly by the surgeon and the patient. signs of moderate or severe malnutrition. patient generated subjective global assessment

34,anonymous,polysomnography in patients with obstructive sleep apnea: an evidence-based analysis,2006,,,"objective: the objective of this health technology policy assessment was to evaluate the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of sleep studies in ontario., clinical need: target population and condition sleep disorders are common and obstructive sleep apnea (osa) is the predominant type. obstructive sleep apnea is the repetitive complete obstruction (apnea) or partial obstruction (hypopnea) of the collapsible part of the upper airway during sleep. the syndrome is associated with excessive daytime sleepiness or chronic fatigue. several studies have shown that osa is associated with hypertension, stroke, and other cardiovascular disorders many researchers believe that these cardiovascular disorders are consequences of osa. this has generated increasing interest in recent years in sleep studies., the technology being reviewed: there is no gold standard for the diagnosis of osa, which makes it difficult to calibrate any test for diagnosis. traditionally, polysomnography (psg) in an attended setting (sleep laboratory) has been used as a reference standard for the diagnosis of osa. polysomnography measures several sleep variables, one of which is the apnea-hypopnea index (ahi) or respiratory disturbance index (rdi). the ahi is defined as the sum of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep apnea is defined as the absence of airflow for 10 seconds and hypopnea is defined as reduction in respiratory effort with 4 oxygen desaturation. the rdi is defined as the sum of apneas, hypopneas, and abnormal respiratory events per hour of sleep. often the two terms are used interchangeably. the ahi has been widely used to diagnose osa, although with different cut-off levels, the basis for which are often unclear or arbitrarily determined. generally, an ahi of more than five events per hour of sleep is considered abnormal and the patient is considered to have a sleep disorder. an abnormal ahi accompanied by excessive daytime sleepiness is the hallmark for osa diagnosis. for patients diagnosed with osa, continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) therapy is the treatment of choice. polysomnography may also used for titrating cpap to individual needs. in january 2005, the college of physicians and surgeons of ontario published the second edition of independent health facilities: clinical practice parameters and facility standards: sleep medicine, commonly known as the sleep book. the sleep book states that osa is the most common primary respiratory sleep disorder and a full overnight sleep study is considered the current standard test for individuals in whom osa is suspected (based on clinical signs and symptoms), particularly if cpap or surgical therapy is being considered. polysomnography in a sleep laboratory is time-consuming and expensive. with the evolution of technology, portable devices have emerged that measure more or less the same sleep variables in sleep laboratories as in the home. newer cpap devices also have auto-titration features and can record sleep variables including ahi. these devices, if equally accurate, may reduce the dependency on sleep laboratories for the diagnosis of osa and the titration of cpap, and thus may be more cost-effective. difficulties arise, however, when trying to assess and compare the diagnostic efficacy of in-home psg versus in-lab. the ahi measured from portable devices in-home is the sum of apneas and hypopneas per hour of time in bed, rather than of sleep, and the absolute diagnostic efficacy of in-lab psg is unknown. to compare in-home psg with in-lab psg, several researchers have used correlation coefficients or sensitivity and specificity, while others have used bland-altman plots or receiver operating characteristics (roc) curves. all these approaches, however, have potential pitfalls. correlation coefficients do not measure agreement sensitivity and specificity are not helpful when the true disease status is unknown and bland-altman plots measure agreement (but are helpful when the range of clinical equivalence is known). lastly, receiver operating characteristics curves are generated using logistic regression with the true disease status as the dependent variable and test values as the independent variable. thus, each value of the test is used as a cut-point to measure sensitivity and specificity, which are then plotted on an x-y plane. the cut-point that maximizes both sensitivity and specificity is chosen as the cut-off level to discriminate between disease and no-disease states. in the absence of a gold standard to determine the true disease status, roc curves are of minimal value. at the request of the ontario health technology advisory committee (ohtac), mas has thus reviewed the literature on psg published over the last two years to examine new developments., methods:, review strategy: there is a large body of literature on sleep studies and several reviews have been conducted. two large cohort studies, the sleep heart health study and the wisconsin sleep cohort study, are the main sources of evidence on sleep literature. to examine new developments on psg published in the past two years, medline, embase, medline in-process other non-indexed citations, the cochrane database of systematic reviews and cochrane central, inahta, and websites of other health technology assessment agencies were searched. any study that reported results of in-home or in-lab psg was included. all articles that reported findings from the sleep heart health study and the wisconsin sleep cohort study were also reviewed. diffusion of sleep laboratories: to estimate the diffusion of sleep laboratories, a list of sleep laboratories licensed under the independent health facility act was obtained. the annual number of sleep studies per 100,000 individuals in ontario from 2000 to 2004 was also estimated using administrative databases., summary of findings:, literature review: a total of 315 articles were identified that were published in the past two years 227 were excluded after reviewing titles and abstracts. a total of 59 articles were identified that reported findings of the sleep heart health study and the wisconsin sleep cohort study., prevalence: based on cross-sectional data from the wisconsin sleep cohort study of 602 men and women aged 30 to 60 years, it is estimated that the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing is 9 in women and 24 in men, on the basis of more than five ahi events per hour of sleep. among the women with sleep disorder breathing, 22.6 had daytime sleepiness and among the men, 15.5 had daytime sleepiness. based on this, the prevalence of osa in the middle-aged adult population is estimated to be 2 in women and 4 in men. snoring is present in 94 of osa patients, but not all snorers have osa. women report daytime sleepiness less often compared with their male counterparts (of similar age, body mass index bmi, and ahi). prevalence of osa tends to be higher in older age groups compared with younger age groups. diagnostic value of polysomnography: it is believed that psg in the sleep laboratory is more accurate than in-home psg. in the absence of a gold standard, however, claims of accuracy cannot be substantiated. in general, there is poor correlation between psg variables and clinical variables. a variety of cut-off points of ahi ( 5, 10, and 15) are arbitrarily used to diagnose and categorize severity of osa, though the clinical importance of these cut-off points has not been determined. recently, a study of the use of a therapeutic trial of cpap to diagnose osa was reported. the authors studied habitual snorers with daytime sleepiness in the absence of other medical or psychiatric disorders. using psg as the reference standard, the authors calculated the sensitivity of this test to be 80 and its specificity to be 97. further, they concluded that psg could be avoided in 46 of this population. obstructive sleep apnea and obesity: obstructive sleep apnea is strongly associated with obesity. obese individuals (bmi 30 kg/m(2)) are at higher risk for osa compared with non-obese individuals and up to 75 of osa patients are obese. it is hypothesized that obese individuals have large deposits of fat in the neck that cause the upper airway to collapse in the supine position during sleep. the observations reported from several studies support the hypothesis that ahis (or rdis) are significantly reduced with weight loss in obese individuals. obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular diseases: associations have been shown between osa and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension, which are known risk factors for myocardial infarction and stroke. patients with more severe forms of osa (based on ahi) report poorer quality of life and increased health care utilization compared with patients with milder forms of osa. from animal models, it is hypothesized that sleep fragmentation results in glucose intolerance and hypertension. there is, however, no evidence from prospective studies in humans to establish a causal link between osa and hypertension or diabetes mellitus. it is also not clear that the associations between osa and other diseases are independent of obesity in most of these studies, patients with higher values of ahi had higher values of bmi compared with patients with lower ahi values. a recent meta-analysis of bariatric surgery has shown that weight loss in obese individuals (mean bmi 46.8 kg/m(2) range 32.30-68.80) significantly improved their health profile. diabetes was resolved in 76.8 of patients, hypertension was resolved in 61.7 of patients, hyperlipidemia improved in 70 of patients, and osa resolved in 85.7 of patients. this suggests that obesity leads to osa, diabetes, and hypertension, rather than osa independently causing diabetes and hypertension.

39,c. m. apovian,the clinical and economic consequences of obesity,2013,,,"obesity and its many serious comorbidities exert a heavy toll in both human and economic terms. more than one-third of adults in the united states are obese and, therefore, subject to elevated rates of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. the negative effect on the quality of life (qol) of these individuals is enormous. among the severely obese, qol scores are comparable to qol scores associated with diabetes and laryngeal cancer. the medical costs of obesity-related illnesses in the united states have been estimated at 209.7 billion annually (in 2008 dollars). for example, with regard to impact on pharmaceutical costs, obesity is associated with a more than 13-fold increase in the cost of antidiabetic medications. the cost of absenteeism to employers has been estimated to exceed 4.3 billion annually. successful and cost-effective short-term treatments for obesity are available, and have been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk factors. intensive lifestyle intervention with the goal of losing 7 of baseline body weight, for example, resulted in a 58 reduction in the risk of diabetes in patients with prediabetes. in clinical trials, improvements in other cardiovascular risk factors, such as elevated triglycerides and high blood pressure, have also been seen with a modest weight loss of 5 to 10 of baseline body weight. as obesity becomes an ever greater public health problem, additional interventions with long-term efficacy are needed to reduce body weight and maintain weight loss.",49,1.0

outcomes than adjustable gastric banding. for people with very high bmi, biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch resulted in greater weight loss than rygb. duodenojejunal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic rygb had similar outcomes, however this is based on one small trial. isolated sleeve gastrectomy led to better weight-loss outcomes than adjustable gastric banding after three years follow-up. this was based on one trial only. weight-related outcomes were similar between laparoscopic gastric imbrication and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in one trial. across all

435,s. medical advisory,bariatric surgery: an evidence-based analysis,2005,,,"objective: to conduct an evidence-based analysis of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery., background: obesity is defined as a body mass index (bmi) of at last 30 kg/m(2). () morbid obesity is defined as a bmi of at least 40 kg/m(2) or at least 35 kg/m(2) with comorbid conditions. comorbid conditions associated with obesity include diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemias, obstructive sleep apnea, weight-related arthropathies, and stress urinary incontinence. it is also associated with depression, and cancers of the breast, uterus, prostate, and colon, and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. obesity is also associated with higher all-cause mortality at any age, even after adjusting for potential confounding factors like smoking. a person with a bmi of 30 kg/m(2) has about a 50 higher risk of dying than does someone with a healthy bmi. the risk more than doubles at a bmi of 35 kg/m(2). an expert estimated that about 160,000 people are morbidly obese in ontario. in the united states, the prevalence of morbid obesity is 4.7 (1999-2000). in ontario, the 2004 chief medical officer of health report said that in 2003, almost one-half of ontario adults were overweight (bmi 25-29.9 kg/m(2)) or obese (bmi 30 kg/m(2)). about 57 of ontario men and 42 of ontario women were overweight or obese. the proportion of the population that was overweight or obese increased gradually from 44 in 1990 to 49 in 2000, and it appears to have stabilized at 49 in 2003. the report also noted that the tendency to be overweight and obese increases with age up to 64 years. bmi should be used cautiously for people aged 65 years and older, because the normal range may begin at slightly above 18.5 kg/m(2) and extend into the overweight range. the chief medical officer of health cautioned that these data may underestimate the true extent of the problem, because they were based on self reports, and people tend to over-report their height and under-report their weight. the actual number of ontario adults who are overweight or obese may be higher. diet, exercise, and behavioural therapy are used to help people lose weight. the goals of behavioural therapy are to identify, monitor, and alter behaviour that does not help weight loss. techniques include self-monitoring of eating habits and physical activity, stress management, stimulus control, problem solving, cognitive restructuring, contingency management, and identifying and using social support. relapse, when people resume old, unhealthy behaviour and then regain the weight, can be problematic. drugs (including gastrointestinal lipase inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and appetite suppressants) may be used if behavioural interventions fail. however, estimates of efficacy may be confounded by high rates of noncompliance, in part owing to the side effects of the drugs. in addition, the drugs have not been approved for indefinite use, despite the chronic nature of obesity., the technology: morbidly obese people may be eligible for bariatric surgery. bariatric surgery for morbid obesity is considered an intervention of last resort for patients who have attempted first-line forms of medical management, such as diet, increased physical activity, behavioural modification, and drugs. there are various bariatric surgical procedures and several different variations for each of these procedures. the surgical interventions can be divided into 2 general types: malabsorptive (bypassing parts of the gastrointestinal tract to limit the absorption of food), and restrictive (decreasing the size of the stomach so that the patient is satiated with less food). all of these may be performed as either open surgery or laparoscopically. an example of a malabsorptive technique is roux-en-y gastric bypass (rygb). examples of restrictive techniques are vertical banded gastroplasty (vbg) and adjustable gastric banding (agb). the ontario health insurance plan (ohip) schedule of benefits for physician services includes fee code s120 gastric bypass or p rtition, for morbid obesity as an insured service. the term gastric bypass is a general term that encompasses a variety of surgical methods, all of which involve reconfiguring the digestive system. the term gastric bypass does not include agb. the number of gastric bypass procedures funded and done in ontario, and funded as actual out-of-country approvals,() is shown below. number of gastric bypass procedures by fiscal year: ontario and actual out-of-country (ooc) approvalsdata from provider services, mohltccourtesy of provider services, ministry of health and long term care, review strategy: the medical advisory secretariat reviewed the literature to assess the effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery to treat morbid obesity. it used its standard search strategy to retrieve international health technology assessments and english-language journal articles from selected databases. the interventions of interest were bariatric surgery and, for the controls, either optimal conventional management or another type of bariatric procedure. the outcomes of interest were improvement in comorbid conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension) short- and long-term weight loss quality of life adverse effects and economic analysis data. the databases yielded 15 international health technology assessments or systematic reviews on bariatric surgery. subsequently, the medical advisory secretariat searched medline and embase from april 2004 to december 2004, after the search cut-off date of april, 2004, for the most recent systematic reviews on bariatric surgery. ten studies met the inclusion criteria. one of those 10 was the swedish obese subjects study, which started as a registry and intervention study, and then published findings on people who had been enrolled for at least 2 years or at least 10 years. in addition to the literature review of economic analysis data, the medical advisory secretariat also did an ontario-based economic analysis., summary of findings: bariatric surgery generally is effective for sustained weight loss of about 16 for people with bmis of at least 40 kg/m(2) or at least 35 kg/m(2) with comorbid conditions (including diabetes, high lipid levels, and hypertension). it also is effective at resolving the associated comorbid conditions. this conclusion is largely based on level 3a evidence from the prospectively designed swedish obese subjects study, which recently published 10-year outcomes for patients who had bariatric surgery compared with patients who received nonsurgical treatment. (1)regarding specific procedures, there is evidence that malabsorptive techniques are better than other banding techniques for weight loss and resolution of comorbid illnesses. however, there are no published prospective, long-term, direct comparisons of these techniques available.surgery for morbid obesity is considered an intervention of last resort for patients who have attempted first-line forms of medical management, such as diet, increased physical activity, behavioural modification, and drugs. in the absence of direct comparisons of active nonsurgical intervention via caloric restriction with bariatric techniques, the following observations are made:a recent systematic review examining the efficacy of major commercial and organized self-help weight loss programs in the united states concluded that the evidence to support the use of such programs was suboptimal, except for one trial on weight watchers. furthermore, the programs were associated with high costs, attrition rates, and probability of regaining at least 50 of the lost weight in 1 to 2 years. (2)a recent randomized controlled trial reported 1-year outcomes comparing weight loss and metabolic changes in severely obese patients assigned to either a low-carbohydrate diet or a conventional weight loss diet. at 1 year, weight loss was similar for patients in each group (mean, 2-5 kg). there was a favourable effect on triglyceride levels and glycemic control in the low-carbohydrate diet group. (3)a decision-analysis model showed bariatric surg ry results in increased life expectancy in morbidly obese patients when compared to diet and exercise. (4)a cost-effectiveness model showed bariatric surgery is cost-effective relative to nonsurgical management. (5)extrapolating from 2003 data from the united states, ontario would likely need to do 3,500 bariatric surgeries per year. it currently does 508 per year, including out-of-country surgeries.",435,1.0
436,l. f. meneghini,impact of bariatric surgery on type 2 diabetes,2007,,,"the management and prevention of diabetes through lifestyle modifications and weight loss should be the mainstay of therapy in appropriate candidates. although the results from the diabetes prevention trial and the finnish prevention study support this approach, over 95 of patients not participating in a prevention research study are unable to achieve and maintain any significant weight loss over time. bariatric surgery for weight loss is an emerging option for more sustainable weight loss in the severely obese subject, especially when obesity is complicated by diabetes or other co-morbidities. the two most common types of procedures currently used in the united states are adjustable gastric bands and roux-en-y gastric bypass. these procedures can be performed laparoscopically, further reducing the perioperative morbidity and mortality associated with the surgery. while the gastric bypass procedure usually results is greater sustained weight loss (40-50) than adjustable gastric banding (20-30), it also carries greater morbidity and nutritional/metabolic issues, such as deficiencies in iron, b12, calcium, and vitamin d. following bariatric surgery most subjects experience improvements in diabetes control, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and other obesity-related conditions. in patients with impaired glucose tolerance most studies report 99-100 prevention of progression to diabetes, while in subjects with diabetes prior to surgery, resolution of the disease is reported in 64-93 of the cases. while improvements in insulin resistance and beta-cell function are related to surgically induced weight loss, the rapid post-operative improvement in glycemia is possibly due to a combination of decreased nutrient intake and changes in gut hormones as a result of the bypassed intestine. post-prandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia associated with nesidioblastosis has been described in a series of patients following gastric bypass surgery, and may be related to the described changes in glp-1 and other gut hormones.",436,1.0

either propofol or desflurane as the primary anaesthetic agent for the duration of this surgery. the following minor differences between groups are outlined: 1. for anaesthesia induction, the desflurane group will receive inhalational sevoflurane, as desflurane is pungent and irritant to the airway making inhalational induction of anaesthesia difficult. following induction of anaesthesia with sevoflurane, the anaesthetic will be changed to desflurane at 0.5_2 mac as necessary (this will include desflurane administration during cardiopulmonary bypass via the oxygen inlet to the circuit). 2. patients in the propofol group will have general anaesthesia induced and maintained by propofol (effect site steering using an asena tci pump and levels maintained from 1.5_3ug/ml using the marsh pharmacokinetic profile). no volatile anaesthesic agent will be allowed in this group including during cpb. the following anaesthesia, surgery, cardiopulmonary bypass, and sedation techniques will be common for both groups: 1. anaesthesia co_induction / sedation with fentanyl (2_5 ug/kg) and midazolam (0.025_ 0.05mg/kg). following induction of anaesthesia, patients will be maintained on a combined intravenous infusion of fentanyl (1.5 ug/kg/hr) and midazolam (0.025_0.05 mg/kg/hr) with fi021. 2. anaesthesia monitoring: in addition to specified routine anaesthetic monitoring as per australian and new zealand college of anaesthetists guidelines for general anaesthesia (38), all patients will have intra_arterial pressure monitoring, pulmonary artery (pa) pressure

cumulative and reported for the entire hospital stay: 3. hemodynamic management: metaraminol or nitro_glycerin can be administered to control systemic arterial blood pressure within a systolic arterial pressure range of 100_140 mmhg. beta blockade can be used at the anaesthetists discretion for either haemodynamic control, or management of ventricular arrhythmias. 5. post cpb hemodynamic management: cardiac output will be measur d by a thermodilution technique. dobutamine can be administered for low cardiac output (cardiac index less than 2.0 l/min/m2) and noradrenaline can be used for low svr syndrome if felt appropriate by anaesthetist, surgeon, or intensivist concerned. 6. postoperative sedation: following skin closure, all anaesthesia agents will be ceased. a low dose propofol infusion will be permitted for postoperative icu sedation until they are suitable for extubation.the aim is for a ramsay sedation score of 2 upon initial return to icu then once haemodynamically stable, to aim for a score of 4. patients will be escorted to the intensive care unit and will be ventilated until they have achieved accepted standard criteria for extubation (awake and co_operative, warm, haemodynamically stable, paco250mmhg, pao2 100 on fio2 0.4). patients will be allowed to awaken in icu and extubated. 7. rescue protocol: in both groups additional rescue analgesia will be allowed in the form of fentanyl, or morphine, paracetamol, tramadol, or indomethacin as necessary to provide adequate analgesia. composite morbidity/mortality score this will be a weighted morbidity score. it will score 3 points for death, 2 points for a major morbid outcome and 1 point for any minor outcome. major morbid outcome is defined as any outcome that is permanent (e.g. stroke) or has a natural history in that it could lead to death, but without actually causing death. it is derived from morbidity likely to result from inadequate tissue perfusion or immunomodulation. economics hospital economics will be assessed on multiple criteria 1. time spent in icu 2. time spent in hospital 3. cost of all blood products 4. re_operation 5. pathology and other investigations needed while in hospital 6. cost of drugs administered cost/economics estimations are taken from australian published studies and index to 2006 prices. investigation tests are based on

of hospital days which will be charged as the hospital length of stay _ icu time. the actual cost of the operation are fixed costs (this only relates to the primary operation and not to reoperations). the cost that we are looking at, therefore are potentially variable costs which may be impacted upon by the possible use of volatile anaesthesia, or propofol. obviously a return to or would involve costs involving or time, disposables including cpb circuits, and drugs (including aprotinin and recombinant factor viia). sample size estimates of power and minimal group size were obtained by performing a forward looking power analysis based upon the ability to show a significant difference in neurocognitive testing. this is based on our previous study showing a 38 incidence of neurocognitive abnormality in a group consistent with the propofol arm, and aiming for an effect size reduction of 50. for an 80 power to reject the null hypothesis of no significance (p0.05) in each group, the sample size is 90 patients in each group. randomization the treating anaesthetist will allocate randomization by the sealed envelopes method. implementation the patients will be recruited by professional research staff. randomization will be implemented by the treating anaesthetist. 4. cardiopulmonary bypass: the venous reservoir of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit will be primed with 2l of crystalloid solution (plasma_lyte(r) baxter healthcare) and maintained at a temperature of 35 degrees celsius. cardiopulmonary bypass will be performed in a standardized technique with cannulation of the ascending aorta and with a single two_staged right atrial_caval cannula with non_assisted venous drainage. after initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass the patients nasopharyngeal temperature will be allowed to drift progressively down to 34 degrees celsius at which point it will be maintained by a heat exchanger until rewarming is initiated. patients haemoglo in will be maintained above 70 g/l. the ascending aorta will be cross_clamped and cardiac arrest will be induced by administration of tepid blood cardioplegia at a temperature ranging from 20_25 degrees celsius. the ratio of blood to the initial crystalloid cardioplegia required to achieve arrest will be 4:1 in order to obtain a potassium concentration in the induction cardioplegia of at least 20 mmol/l. arrest will be achieved by antegrade administration of cardioplegia through an aortic root catheter, followed by retrograde administration through a coronary sinus catheter. left ventricular distension will be monitored for by transoesophageal echocardiography. further doses of maintenance cardioplegia are given following completion of graft anastomoses. rewarming of the patient will commence at the beginning of the last distal anastomosis (or 15 minutes prior to aortic cross clamp removal). the temperature of the heat exchanger used to achieve this will not exceed 37 degrees celsius. atrial pacing wires will be attached if electrical activity has not been established after 5 minutes of reperfusion or if pre_operative heart rate is less than 60 per minute or if the patient is on b_adrenergic antagonists. the patient will remain on full cardiopulmonary bypass support for a period of time approximately equal to 20_25 of cross clamp time or until the anaesthetist, perfusionist, and surgeon are satisfied that cardiac function is appropriate to achieve separation. blinding the study will be open label for the treating anaesthetist who will also collect intraoperative data, and patient (as they will either have an inhalational induction or an intravenous induction, blinding is not possible), preoperative and postoperative data will be collected by professional research staff who will be blinded to the treatment protocol. statistical methods continuous data collected over repeated measurement intervals will be examined by repeated measures anova and adjusted for multisample asphericity by applying the greenhouse geisser correction. categorical data will be analysed using fischers exact test. data will be corrected for multiple comparisons within families of endpoints using the ryan_holm bonferroni correction. intention to treat analysis will be performed. a blinded interim analysis of results will be performed by the data safety monitoring committee upon conclusion of enrolment of 80 patients. stopping values to terminate the study will be set at a p value 0.001 for primary endpoints. timeline we anticipate initial recruitment will be complete 15_18 months following trial commencement. follow up will be complete 3 month after the last enrollment. data validation, statistical analysis and manuscript preparation will be complete by 24 months.",470,1.0
474,nct,antenatal rescue course of glucocorticoids in threatened premature birth,2006,,cn-02013198,"randomized trial on efficacy and safety of the antenatal rescue course of glucocortcoid in threatened premature birth (acg trial) introduction prematurity is the main cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. immature infants have many serious diseases such as respiratory distress syndrome (rds), intracranial hemorrhage (ich), chronic lung disease (cld), necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) and retinopathy of prematurity (rop). corticosteroids have the maturational effects on fetal cardiovascular, respiratory, nervous and gastrointestinal systems (1). antenatal corticosteroids (anc) have been widely used for prevention of rds and other serious diseases in preterm infants since 1972s, when the controlled trial of antepartum glucocorticoid treatment was published. administration of s of 12 mg of betamethasone given twice intramuscularly 24 hours apart has shown to be effective (2,3,4,39). strong evidence exists for neonatal benefits from a complete course of anc starting at 24 hours and lasting up to 7 days after treatment (2,39). betamethasone and dexamethasone have similar biological activity and both are associated with a significant reduction in the risk of rds, but only betamethasone with a significant decrease of the neonatal mortality. the clinical benefit had not been documented beyond 7 days after the onset of anc therapy. (1,2) several randomized studies have shown that a single course of antenatal corticosteroid treatment improves the survival of preterm infants born at 24_34 weeks gestation and decreases the incidence of rds, ich and nec. anc therapy reduces the incidence of rds by approximately 50.(1,2) anc treatment also reduces the need of exogenous surfactant (4). the protective effect against rds is thought to be due to the structural maturation of the lungs, increased surfactant synthesis, improved resistance to lung injury and improved cardiovascular adaptation. glucocorticoid speeds up the normal thinning of the gas_exchange walls with double capillary loops between the air sacs. anc thus accelerates the structural development of the respiratory airways, but reduces the number of alveoli. glucocorticoid increases surfactant synthesis by enhancing maturation of the surfactant_ producing type ii pneumocytes and stimulating the secretion of surfactant complex (1,6,7,8,9,40). serial doses of anc may possibly downregulate steroid receptors resulting in decreased or disordered surfactant production.(ref) anc has not been shown to decrease the incidence of cld at 28 days of age either in the meta_analysis or in the recent retrospective studies (2,13,14,15). anc treatment is associated with maturation of the cardiovascular system and normalisation of the low blood pressure in the small premature infant at birth.(ref) this influence was evident after administration of surfactant.(4) according to meta_analysis, anc had no effect on the incidence of pda. however in several studies, use of anc was associated with increased spontaneous closure of pda(2,3,4, ). anc decreases the incidence of ich in preterm infants (2,3,4). severe prematurity decreases autoregulation of the cerebral circulation and predisposes to ich or cerebral ischemia. glucocorticoids accelerate differentiation of neuronal cells and possibly enhance maturation of germinal matrix vessels (1,33,34). anc therapy has been associated also with a lower incidence of periventricular leukomalacia (pvl) and cerebral palsy (cp), but these effects were not significant in crowleys meta_analysis (2,3,4,5). in a recently published retrospective study, antenatal administration of betamethasone was associated with a decreased risk of pvl compared to antenatal dexamethasone or no treatment (17). specific aim and hypothesis study design present study is a multicenter, randomized, blinded, placebo_controlled trial comparing the benefits and side effects of single vs. second rescue course of antenatal corticosteroid. betamethasone is clinically used as a mixture of betamethasone phosphate (6 mg) and betamethasone acetate (6 mg), providing a rapi exposure from the phosphate form and a sustained exposure from the acetate form. maximal fetal serum level of betamethasone was attained 1_2 hours after anc treatment (27). the half life of antenatally administered betamethasone is about 12 hours in fetal circulation (1,36). decrease in the incidence of rds is evident when anc is administered between 24 hours and 7 days before delivery. however, the incidence of ich is decreased even with treatment initiated less than 24 hours prior to delivery (2,3,4). according to the animal studies the short term anc (24 hours) improves the postnatal lung function, decreases the protein leak into the lung and alters postnatal blood pressure regulation in the premature. anc also seems to augment the postnatal neuroendocrine and endocrine responses to hypoxic challenge (28,29,30). according to meta_analysis there is no significant decrease in birthweight and in physical or psychological development at the age 3_12 years following a single course of anc treatment of fetuses (2,18,19). according to follow_up studies, prenatal single course of steroid treatment is safe and enhanced survival is not associated with a higher incidence of disabilities or developmental disturbances in survivors during childhood and young adulthood (2,3,5,18,19,35). single course of anc treatment did not increase the risk of fetal or neonatal infections or the incidence of maternal infections (2). when administered during the subclinical chorioamnionitis, anc treatment seem to decrease the incidence of rds, ich, pvl and neonatal mortality without apparent increase in neonatal sepsis (32). however, there is concern about possible negative effect of multiple course of anc on birthweight, head circumference and growth later in childhood. data from numerous animal studies suggest that anc has a negative effect on pre_ and postnatal growth. most studies deal with rodents who have a short gestation and period of growth (10,11,12,37). in animal studies multidose anc exposure has also decreased lung growth, which seems to be irreversible and persistent into adulthood (10,11,12). also, in several animal studies anc exposure has shown decreased brain growth and cell proliferation, which may also be due to short duration of gestation and long duration of exposure (10,11,12,37). there are concerns about potential suppressive effects of anc on the fetal hypothalamus_pituitary_adrenal axis. transient suppression of the pituitary_adrenal glands in preterm infants whose mothers have received 1_2 doses of antenatal glucocorticoid, reportedly recovers within 7 days of life (23,24,25,26,36). infants delivered shortly after one course of anc are normally responsive to stress after birth (e.g. rds and asphyxia).(36) clinical practice administering antenatal corticosteroids varies greatly between individual centers during the late 1990s. the practice of repeating the course of anc has become widespread. however the safety or efficacy of serial courses of glucocorticoid is not known. according to recently published non_randomized studies there is conflicting data on growth and neonatal morbidity of infants exposed to single vs. multiple course of anc (13,14,15). there is also concern particularly in women with prolonged premature rupture of fetal membranes (pprom) that repetitive doses may increase maternal and fetal infections (21,22). in a retrospective study the multiple course of anc was associated with an increased incidence of maternal postpartum infections (13). entry criteria the pregnant women will be eligible for the trial entry if all following criteria are met: _ administration of a course of antenatal corticosteroid at least 7 days before the trial entry the effect of multiple courses of anc on the hpa_axis is not well known. in recent studies a mild adrenal suppression was evident in some of the preterm infants whose mothers received more than eight courses of anc (15). it has also been proposed that perinatal stress and exposure to corticosteroids induces long lasting changes in hpa_axis a d is associated with a decrease in stress induced crh release in adulthood (24,34). however, there is no existing data about function of hpa_axis in young adults, who have been exposed to antenatal corticosteroids during fetal life. there is insufficient data about optimal interval of anc administration. according to recent studies there is not additive positive effects of the practice of repeating the course of anc at 7 days intervals. however, it is known that the positive influence of the one course of anc is not evident after 7 days of administration. it is interesting whether one additional rescue course of anc given within 24 hours before premature delivery is more effective than single course of anc. no prospective studies or randomized, controlled trials comparing single versus second rescue course of antenatal corticosteroids have been published. the present aim is to study whether in recipients of anc a single dose of betamethasone given shortly before spontaneous or elective premature birth (gestation 24 0 33 6 wk) improves the neonatal outcome without causing serious side effects. according to protocol, aim is to start the placebo or the second rescue course of anc in 48 hours before expected delivery. the first hypothesis states that administration of second rescue course of anc is more effective than the single course of anc in increasing the intact survival at term of all infants without major neonatal morbidity, defined by the protocol. the principal outcome is survival of premature infants without major morbidity until the age of 360 weeks and survival of infants born at term during early neonatal period without the major morbidity, as defined by the protocol. _ gestational age is less than 33.0 weeks 6 days _ very high risk of premature delivery _ none of the following therapies complications or therapies maternal long term systemic corticosteroid therapy severe clinical chorioamnionitis (maternal fever, increased crp or another acute phase protein, uterine tenderness) lethal disease of the fetus _ informed consent obtained _ premature rupture of membranes is not contraindication for the trial entry gestational age will be calculated from the mothers last menstrual period and confirmed by ultrasound before 20 weeks gestation. in case the discrepancy in the estimates exceeds two weeks, ultrasound date is accepted. very high risk of premature delivery is described as follows: _ elective delivery within within 4_48 hours, as indicated by the obstetrician on the basis of the clinical status of the mother and/or the fetus _ very high risk of spontaneous delivery within 4_48 hours, i.e. _ cervix is open 3 cm _ contractions of the uterus at 5_10 min intervals _ rupture of the membranes after the first course of anc _ fetal and/or maternal indication for elective premature delivery or cesarean section trial entry the investigator or his/her designated representative will evaluate the pregnant women for the above eligibility criteria. administration of one course of antenatal glucocorticoid identifies the pregnant mothers that are potentially eligible to present study. oral and written informed consent will be obtained from the women (if appropriate). the study entry (randomization and administration of the drug) takes place when all entry criteria are met. the parturient and her randomization number will be recorded on the trial data form and on patient records to enable later description of the women and to assist follow up. at the time of delivery the infants of the trial participants will be recorded to the trial data form and on patient records. randomization the eligible women will be randomly and blindly assigned to receive either betamethasone or saline placebo. the randomization will take place separately in each center according to the following strata: i gestation at entry less than 28.0 weeks 0 days and singleton pregnancy ii gestation at entry 28.0 weeks 0 days or more but less than 33.0 weeks 6 days and singleton pregnancy iii gestation at ntry less than 28.0 weeks 0 days and multiple pregnancy iv gestation at entry 28.0 weeks 0 days or more but less than 33.0 weeks 6 days and multiple pregnancy study intervention the first course of anc prior to the trial entry will be given according to the clinical indications of the center. administration of further courses of anc before the trial entry will disqualify the mother from the acg trial. the study course of betamethasone or placebo will be given to each eligible woman at least 7 days after the first course of anc. after the entry criteria are met betamethasone (12mg) or placebo (normal saline) will be drawn to a sealed syringe containing the randomization number. the drug or placebo is administered intramuscularly. within 1 hour the betamethasone dose increases the fetal serum levels of glucocorticoid to those obtained during neonatal stress other obstetric and neonatal management other management given to the participating women will be decided by the obstetrician. after the entry to the trial administration of anc outside study protocol is not allowed. in an event premature delivery did not occur after acg, any further administration of anc is not indicated. the premature infants are treated in whatever way their condition demands, the decision is made by pediatrician. the acg trial infants born after 33.0 6 weeks of pregnancy are included in the neonatal and the follow_up studies. fetuses that died after the trial entry will be recorded. the pathologic examination of these fetuses is strongly encouraged. measurement of outcome primary outcome of the trial: term birth or survival of the infants at the gestational age of 36.0 weeks 0 days without any of the following: rds need of supplemental oxygen 48 h or surfactant therapy and characteristic radiographic findings severe ich (grades 3_4) infants born in term will be evaluated by ultrasound maternal_antenatal outcomes: clinical chorioamnionitis any maternal infection fetal death secondary

infants will be studied. for the high_risk group, the following indices and studies will be performed: mental development index (mdi) (70) psychomotor development will be measured by bayley scale (pdi) behavioral development index (percentile) definition of abnormalities in neurological status, speech development, major visual handicap and hearing defect information will be collected at the time of delivery, during the hospital stay and when the baby leaves the hospital or dies. perinatal data will include prenatal history, assessment of entry criteria and following information of postnatal condition: blood pressure monitoring, assessment of growth at birth, day 28 and at 36 weeks gestational ag (height, weight and head circumference). cranial ultrasound will be made on all infants at least between days 4_8 of life and at 36.0 w 0 d ( 3 days) gestational age or before discharge. the worst grade of ich and pvl will be reported. the first ophthalmologic examination for retinopathy of prematurity will be done 4 to 7 weeks after birth or at 32 weeks gestational age. sample size justification the primary goal of the study is to detect the effects of two vs. single course of anc on survival without rds and/or severe ich (grade 3_4) by 36 weeks 0 days of gestational age. sample size analysis is based on morbidity and mortality from the finnish perinatal statistics (national research and development centre for welfare and health) and from vermont oxford network database (von). we estimate that a second additional dose of betamethasone would increase the survival without rds and severe ich from 50 to 62.5. according to power analysis the sample size of 220 women would be required in each arm to reject the null hypothesis with and _ of 0.05 and power of 80. the aim of the follow up study is to find out that one course of anc result in equal or better neurodevelopmental outcome at the corrected age of two years, compared a single course of anc. statistical analysis primary outcome analysis of the primary outcomes will be based on an intention to treat analysis of all randomized subjects. another analysis will be performed excluding infants who had congenital lethal malformation that was not detected at the onset. the outcome will be compared for the two vs. single course of anc using the mantel_haenszel chi square test stratifying by the prenatal variables. secondary outcomes the frequencies of categorical outcomes will be compared using appropriate chi square tests. the growth parameters, duration of ventilation, supplemental oxygen administration and hospitalization will be compared using analysis of variance or nonparametric tests when applicable. survival rate will be compared using chi square tests and survival to term using survival analysis. interim analysis the neonatal and the follow_up results for adverse outcomes will be prepared by the data safety monitoring committee when altogether 350 study infants have reached to the term or when the trial has been going on for 24 months, whichever comes first. ethical considerations a written informed consent will be obtained from all the parents

475,nct,stent vs. angioplasty for treatment of thrombosed av grafts: long-term outcomes,2007,,cn-01498093,"hypotheses 1. the primary patency of grafts following thrombectomy and angioplasty is limited by the high re_stenosis rate. 2. stent deployment reduces the likelihood of re_stenosis at the site of the stenotic lesion, thereby prolonging primary graft patency following thrombectomy, and decreasing or delaying the need for future interventions. 3. the cost savings arising from stent deployment (decrease in subsequent access procedures) outweigh the additional cost of the stent itself. aims 1. to evaluate whether stent placement in thrombosed grafts with underlying stenosis at the venous anastomosis results in longer primary graft patency, as compared with angioplasty alone. 2. to determine whether stent placement in thrombosed grafts with underlying stenosis at the venous anastomosis reduces the subsequent cost of access procedures in excess of the cost of the stent. to accomplish these goals, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial of hemodialysis patients who are referred for treatment of thrombosed a_v grafts. the patients will be randomized to be treated with thrombectomy stent deployment or thrombectomy angioplasty. the primary outcomes will be primary (unassisted) graft patency. the secondary outcomes will be secondary (assisted) graft patency and the cumulative cost of all access_related procedures, hospitalizations, and complications. significance and background most patients with end_stage renal disease undergo hemodialysis thrice weekly to optimize their survival, minimize medical complications, and enhance their quality of life. a reliable vascular access is a critical requirement for providing adequate hemodialysis. the ideal vascular access would be easy to place, ready to use as soon as it is placed, deliver high blood flows indefinitely, and be free of complications. none of the existing types of vascular accesses achieve this ideal. among the three types of vascular access currently available, a_v fistulas are superior to a_v grafts, which in turn are superior to dialysis catheters. recognizing the relative merits of the vascular access types, the nkf_doqi guidelines recommend placement of a_v fistulas in 50 of hemodialysis patients, a_v grafts in 40, and dialysis catheters in 10 19. the actual current distribution of vascular accesses among prevalent hemodialysis patients in the united states is 25_30 fistulas, 45_50 grafts, and 25 dialysis catheters 20, 21. vascular access procedures and their subsequent complications represent a major cause of morbidity, hospitalization and cost for chronic hemodialysis patients 22_26. over 20 of hospitalizations in hemodialysis patients in the united states are access_related, and the annual cost of access morbidity is close to 1 billion 25. a small, randomized study comparing stents with conventional angioplasty found no difference in primary graft patency following the intervention 54. however, this study enrolled a mixture of clotted grafts and patent grafts, and the stenotic lesions were at a variety of locations, limiting the interpretation of the findings. a recent, uncontrolled study reported the outcomes of clotted grafts undergoing thrombectomy, as well as stent placement at the venous anastomosis 50. in this more homogeneous group of grafts, the primary graft patency was 63 at 6 months. although there was no matched control group treated with angioplasty alone, the unassisted graft survival was far superior to that reported in several series (11 to 34 at 6 months)10, 57_61 research design and methods methods: angioplasty arm: these patients will undergo the standard of care protocol: mechanical thrombectomy plus angioplasty of the stenosis at the venous anastomosis. procedures: a_v grafts are more prone to recurrent stenosis and thrombosis than are fistulas, and require multiple radiologic or surgical interventions to ensure their long_term patency for dialysis 26. a report from uab observed that the first salvage procedure to maintain graft patency (thrombectomy, angioplasty, or surgic l revision) was required in 29 of grafts at 3 months, 52 at 6 months, 77 at 12 months, and 96 at 24 months 5. most grafts required multiple interventions over time to maintain their patency for dialysis. a mean of 1.22 interventions were required to maintain access patency per graft_year, including 0.51 thrombectomies, 0.54 angioplasties, and 0.17 surgical revisions. secondary graft survival (time from initial placement to permanent failure, regardless of number of interventions) has ranged from 59 to 87 at one year, and 50 to 73 at two years 27_35. a number of studies have examined the association of demographic and clinical factors with long_term graft survival, but no consistent clinical predictor of poor graft outcome has emerged. windus et al 27 observed lower graft survival in diabetics as compared with nondiabetics. in contrast, three other studies observed no significant difference in graft survival between diabetic and nondiabetic patients 5, 35, 36. several investigators have reported a lack of association between patient age or sex and long_term graft survival 5, 35_37. windus et al 27 found that older age predicted lower graft survival in non_diabetics, but not in diabetic patients. graft survival is similar between upper arm and forearm grafts 5, 29. finally, hypoalbuminemia has been associated with shorter a_v graft survival in 2 reports 5, 36. the major cause of graft failure is thrombosis due to underlying stenosis of the venous anastomosis, draining vein, or central vein 10, 38. when the stenosis is not detected and corrected in a timely fashion, grafts typically thrombose. clotted grafts require thrombectomy by either radiology or surgery, most commonly in association with correction of the underlying stenosis. if graft patency cannot be restored, it becomes necessary to construct a vascular access at a new anastomotic site. intervention_free graft patency is considerably lower following thrombectomy than after elective angioplasty 10. a comparison of graft outcomes after radiologic interventions at our institution found that the primary (unassisted) patency was only 30 at 3 months for clotted grafts, as compared with 71 for patent grafts undergoing elective angioplasty 10. not surprisingly, graft survival was worse if there was a residual stenosis after the angioplasty. however, even in the subset of patients with no residual stenosis after the intervention, the primary 3_month patency was still lower in clotted grafts, as compared with patent grafts undergoing elective angioplasty (median survival, 2.5 vs 6.9 months). design: this will be an open_label, prospective, randomized clinical trial comparing the outcomes of thrombosed av grafts treated with mechanical thrombectomy and angioplasty (current standard of care), as compared with stent deployment after mechanical thrombectomy and angioplasty. subjects: the subjects for this study will be recruited from the university of alabama at birmingham (uab) nephrology practice. uab provides medical care for approximately 500 hemodialysis patients, under the supervision of 12 full_time nephrologists. we average 150 graft thrombectomy procedures annually at our institution. all patients will receive 3000 to 4000 units of heparin during the procedure. all patient receive conscious sedation with fentanyl and versed, unless allergic to either one because graft patency is much worse following thrombectomy than after elective angioplasty, the current state of clinical access management involves an ongoing surveillance program to monitor for evidence of hemodynamically significant graft stenosis, and referral of such patients for elective angioplasty or surgical revision. the rationale for this approach is that correction of graft stenosis in a timely fashion will decrease the risk of graft thrombosis and prolong the survival of the graft 19. substantial clinical research has been directed at evaluating the predictive values of several noninvasive screening tests to identify hemodynamically significant graft ste osis, so that the patients can be referred for angioplasty or surgical revision before the graft has a chance to clot. these surveillance methods have included: dynamic dialysis venous pressures, static dialysis venous pressures, recirculation, doppler ultrasound, ultrasound dilution methodology, and access blood flow (reviewed in 39). graft stenosis can also be predicted by aggressive clinical monitoring (looking for decreases in kt/v, prolonged bleeding at graft needle sites, and abnormalities of graft inspection and auscultation 1, 40. a number of observational studies have reported substantial (50_60) reductions in the frequency of graft thrombosis using a variety of surveillance methods 40_43 none have eliminated this problem. four randomized studies evaluating the efficacy of access surveillance on graft outcomes have found that surveillance is an excellent tool for identifying hemodynamically significant graft stenosis. however, the higher frequency of preemptive angioplasty in the surveillance group did not appear to translate into a reduction in graft thrombosis or prolongation of graft survival 44_47. this discrepancy suggests that preemptive angioplasty may not be effective in producing sustained improvement of the stenotic lesion. stent deployment may improve the durability of graft angioplasty and decrease the variability between operators in graft patency following radiologic interventions. thus, it is possible that more frequent use of stents might enhance the value of graft surveillance. screening: after obtaining informed consent, the clinic chart will be reviewed for inclusion and exclusion criteria. the subject will undergo a screening evaluation including a history and physical prior to the intervention. randomization: all subjects with a recent thrombosed av graft who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria and consent to participation in the study will be randomized to either the angioplasty arm or the angioplasty plus stent deployment arm. patients will be taken to the interventional suite in the interventional radiology department. randomization will occur only after ascertaining that that graft flow has been restored and that there is a 50 stenosis at the venous anastomosis. randomization will be accomplished by unsealing a sequentially numbered opaque envelope that contains the randomization allocation for that subject. stent deployment arm: these patients will undergo the same protocol as the angioplasty arm but at the end a covered stent (wallgraft) will be deployed at the stenotic lesion of the venous anastomosis. graft stenosis occurs as a consequence of aggressive myointimal hyperplasia, which occurs most commonly at the venous anastomosis 48. vascular injury resulting from the angioplasty may actually accelerate the process of myointimal hyperplasia, thereby resulting in early re_stenosis 49. endoluminal stents, by forming a rigid scaffold at the venous anastomosis, may slow the encroachment of the area of myointimal hyperplasia into the vascular lumen, thereby limiting the magnitude of recurrent stenosis. thus, use of stents may be of utility in preventing restenosis following angioplasty. stent placement has been attempted for treatment of grafts in which angioplasty results in suboptimal technical success or if the stenosis recurs rapidly. a number of small series have reported the outcomes of stent placement for vascular access with refractory stenosis 50_56. unfortunately, these studies have suffered from several methodologic limitations, including retrospective data collection, absence of a suitable control group, combining patent and thrombosed grafts, combining stents placed at a variety of stenotic sites, and combining grafts with fistulas. angioplasty arm: all patients diagnosed with a thrombosed graft will undergo mechanical thrombectomy within 48 hours of diagnosis in conjunction with angioplasty of the underlying stenotic lesion. the grafts are initially accessed with a single needle at the arterial limb of the graft. a glide wire is passed up to he central vessels and the needle exchanged for a 6_french catheter sheath. mechanical thrombectomy is achieved with a trerotola device. a second 6_french sheath is placed in the venous limb of the graft, and a glide wire passed into the arterial circulation. a fogarty balloon is passed through the wire beyond the arterial anastomosis and pulled back to dislodge the clot. an anterograde and retrograde angiogram of the graft is performed to assess patency and to look and grade the stenotic lesions. lesions at the venous anastomosis with at least 50 stenosis are considered hemodynamically significant. an angioplasty balloon is placed and inflated at the level of the stenotic site. stent arm: the procedure will be identical to that followed in the angioplasty arm. however, after the stenotic lesion has been angioplastied, the appropriate bard fluency_cptfe encapsulated nitinol stent will be deployed. in both randomized groups, a final angiogram of the graft will be performed, and the residual stenosis at the site of the angioplasty quantified. in addition, intra_graft and systemic blood pressures will be measured upon completion of the

initial thrombectomy to the next graft intervention (angioplasty, thrombectomy, or surgical revision). the secondary end points are: 1. secondary patency, (time from thrombectomy to permanent graft failure, regardless of number of subsequent salvage procedures) 2. total cost of access procedures and access complications per year of followup. follow_up period: subjects will be followed for a period of 2 years from the date of randomization. prospective data will be collected on (1) all subsequent access procedures (angioplasty, thrombectomy, surgical revision, or placement of dialysis

complications, e.g., catheter_related bacteremia or metastatic infections. statistical analysis: sample size: power calculations were performed by the statistician (jill barker, ph.d.) on the basis of our preliminary data from the outcome of thrombosed grafts at uab. the estimated sample of 130 patients, evenly divided between the two groups, was sufficient to detect a tripling in median graft survival from 1 month on the control arm to 3 months on the stent arm, assuming an exponential distribution, 3 years of accrual, 1 year of followup, two_sided significance level of 0.05, and power of 0.80. analysis: the statistical analysis will be done in collaboration with jill barker, ph.d.

476,nct,impact of gbs on cvd in type 2 diabetes mellitus,2008,,cn-02021519,"patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) are more likely to die from cardiovascular diseases (cvd) than people without diabetes. furthermore, patients with diabetes have not benefited from the advances in the management of cvd and/or its risk factors that have resulted in a decrease in mortality for cvd patients without diabetes. short_term studies have demonstrated that weight loss in over weight or obese subjects with t2dm is associated with decreased insulin resistance, substantial improvements in glycemic and lipoprotein profile, and reduction in blood pressure. however, long_term data substantiating that these improvements can be maintained are limited. obesity, and susceptibility to weight gain, is a chronic condition. continuous care is required to avoid weight regain especially after intensive weigh loss. morbidly obese patients with body mass index (bmi) over 35 kg/m2 have significant difficulties maintaining weight loss adequate to resolve obesity_related medical conditions by changes in lifestyle or pharmacologic strategies. currently, surgical treatment of morbid obesity, termed bariatric surgery, appears to be the only modality that results in significant and sustained weight loss along with reversal of diabetes and improvements in cholesterol biosynthesis, and lipoprotein metabolism in morbidly obese patients. given these observations, we question if patients with t2dm who undergo gastric bypass surgery will significantly reduce levels of abnormalities in vascular structure and function that are central to the development of atherosclerosis. in specific aim 1, we will determine whether surgically induced weight loss decreases the risk of cvd in morbidly obese subjects with t2dm. . in specific aim 2, we will elucidate the mechanisms by which surgically induced weight loss reduces over time the risk of cvd in morbidly obsess subjects with t2dm. the proposed study is a prospective cohort clinic trial aimed to evaluate changes over time in cardiovascular structure and function of morbidly obese subjects with t2dm undergoing gastric bypass surgery compared to a matched control group who do not undergo gastric bypass surgery. the results of the proposed study will provide the foundation for a new clinic strategy aimed to prevent the development of cvd in obese patients with t2dm. furthermore, it will serve as the baseline for future large scale longitudinal studies based on aggregate occurrence of severe cardiovascular events.",473,1.0

designed as a randomized, double_blind, placebo_controlled trial. all patients gave their informed consent after receiving written information of the study. orthopedic patients were invited to participated between september 2009 and august 2010. patients were considered eligible if they were aged between 15_70 yr, asa physical status i_iii, and were scheduled for lower limb surgery under spinal anesthesia. patients were excluded if they presented of any following reasons: contraindication for spinal anesthesia, known allergy history to gabapentin, complaint of pruritus before surgery, morbid obesity (bmi 35), coexisting skin disorder, and any systemic disease associated with pruritus. patients who had history of seizure attacks, mental illness, chronic headache, or neuropathic pain and were concomitantly using of anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antipsychotics, or antihistamine were also excluded. patients were randomized into the treatment and the placebo groups according to a computer_generated randomization list and patients were allocated consecutively. the blinding was maintained by keeping the treatment code with one of the investigators, separating them from the investigator performing the assessments. patients in the gabapentin group received two capsules of gabapentin 300 mg (neurontin, pfizer) at 2 h before operation. the patients in the placebo group received equal numbers of identical looking placebo, according to the same schedule. in order to prepare the identical looking medications, for gabapentin group we coated gabapentin capsules by other capsules and for placebo group we filled the identical looking capsules with flour. all patients did not receive any other sedative agents beside the study drugs. after standard monitoring (electrocardiogram, noninvasive arterial blood pressure, and pulse oximetry) was set_up in the operating room, each patient was received ringers lactate or normal saline solution 5_10 ml/kg, spinal anesthesia was performed at the l2_3 or l3_4 interspace with a 27_gauge quincke_type needle using 0.5 isobaric bupivacaine plus 0.2 mg of preservative_free morphine. midazolam, morphine, fentanyl and propofol were administered intravenously (iv) for intraoperative sedation at the discretion of the anesthesiologist. we excluded the patient who failed spinal block, inadequate block, and the patient who had prolong operative time which had to continue with general anesthesia because we could not evaluate pruritus. the sedation level was evaluated by the ramsay sedation scale during the operation. the patients were followed for 24 h after intrathecal administration of morphine. postoperative wound pain was assessed with a verbal numeric rating scale (vnrs). rescue treatments for postoperative pain were provided with any medications ordered by anesthesiologists or orthopedists. pruritus was evaluated at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 24 h after intrathecal administration of morphine by a blinded investigator. the patients were questioned about the presence and degree of pruritus. the degree of pruritus was classified as 0 absent, 1 mild (restricted to one area such as face or arms, not troubling the patient, often reported only after prompting), 2 moderate (affecting a larger area such as face and arms or face and anterior surface of thorax, not disturbing the patient, therefore not requiring treatment), or 3 severe (extensive or generalized, often disturbing the patient to the point of necessitating treatment). severe pruritus was treated with 10 mg iv chlopheniramine. patients were also evaluated the severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting (ponv) which graded on a four point scale as 0 no nausea or vomiting, 1 mild nausea only, 2 nausea or vomiting responding to initial treatment, and 3 nausea or vomiting requiring repeat treatment, the presence of urinary retention and the other side effects of drug treatment. patients who reported v miting received 4 mg iv ondansetron or 10 mg iv metoclopramide. the primary outcome measure of the study was the incidence of pruritus during the 24 h follow_up period. the difference of onset time and severity of pruritus in the gabapentin and placebo groups served as the secondary outcome measure. additional secondary outcome measures were side effects of the gabapentin group. there was an intention_to_treat in our study. statistical analysis was performed using the r 2.11.1 software. we considered a 35 reduction in the incidence of pruritus to be clinically important according to the previous studys result showed that gabapentin 1200 mg could reduce incidence of intrathecal morphine_induce pruritus by 3812. in our study we reduced the dose of gabapentin to 600 mg as describe previously so we think the efficacy of the drug may decrease so we assumed that gabapentin 600 mg could reduced incidence of intrathecal morphine_induced pruritus by 35. power analysis was performed to determine the sample size with a probability for a type ii error of 0.2 and type i error of 0.05. to detect a 35 reduction in the incidence of pruritus, using the incidence of pruritus in songklanagarind hospital which was 63, a sample size of 80 patients in each group was estimated to be required. to accommodate for 10 patient dropouts and failure of spinal anesthesia, 88 patients were enrolled in each group. incidence of pruritus was measured by using chi_square test. the onset time and severity of pruritus was analyzed by means of kaplan_meier probability curves. continuous data were analyzed using un_paired student t_test for normal distribution data such as bmi and by mann_whitney u test for non normal distribution data such as age, operative time, postoperative verbal numeric rating pain score. comparison of

482,nct,the act-out trial: activity outcomes based on high carbohydrate or high fat diet in metabolic syndrome,2011,,cn-01486601,"1. background and rationale: current obesity prevention emphasizes increasing physical activity and a low_fat, calorie restricted diet to produce a negative caloric balance. caloric restriction is associated with decreases in energy expenditure. the other mainstay of obesity prevention increasing levels of physical activity is associated with greater caloric intake. failure of the eat less_exercise more strategy is evident with epidemic of obesity, metabolic syndrome (mets) and type ii diabetes. moreover, the displacement of dietary fat in the diet has led to compensatory increases in carbohydrate intake that is associated with untoward metabolic effects. carbohydrate restricted diets are controversial despite benefits of this approach. the controversy stems from a compensatory increase in dietary fat intake associated with carbohydrate restriction and fears that greater fat intake increases risk of cardiovascular disease. carbohydrate restriction decreases insulin resistance and ameliorates mets. this protocol aims to establish a greater evidence base for carbohydrate restricted diets as a therapeutic option for mets. the investigators will review current knowledge with respect to: (i) obesity and insulin resistance in canada, (ii) positions of major medical organizations (iii) shortcomings of the current obesity prevention paradigm (iv) why carbohydrate restricted diets work. 1.1) obesity and insulin resistance in canada in the 1980s low fat, caloric restricted diets became the cornerstone of dietary advice to reduce obesity. this approach successfully reduced the percent of calories from fat with a consequential increase in carbohydrate consumption. in the ensuing years, obesity become epidemic. in canada, the prevalence of obesity (bmi 30 kg/m2) increased from 10 in 1970s to 23 in 2004 with an additional 36 considered overweight (bmi 25_29.9). as obesity is a risk factor for mets and type ii diabetes, the prevalence of these disorders has also reached epidemic proportions. approximately 2 million canadians were living with diabetes in 2007 and by 2012 it is estimated that 2.8 million canadians will be living with diabetes. first nations communities have been especially hard hit, with a prevalence 3_4 times higher and a younger age of onset than non_first nations individuals. novel chronic disease prevention strategies are needed to address this crisis. insulin resistance underpins the pathophysiology of obesity, insulin resistance is a condition in which normal amounts of insulin are inadequate to produce a normal insulin response from fat, muscle and liver cells. as a result, insulin resistant individuals have both elevated blood glucose, fasting insulin and secrete greater amounts of insulin in response to dietary carbohydrate. this compensatory hyperinsulinemia is associated with adverse effects in tissues which retain their sensitivity to insulin. elevated blood glucose levels are associated with advanced glycation end products, reactive oxygen species and low grade inflammation. these exposures are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease diabetes. despite the evidence associating elevated insulin levels to atherogenic changes in the vasculature, it remains a matter of controversy as to whether persistently elevated insulin levels are pathogenic. the diagnosis of mets represents an entry_point for disease prevention efforts in individuals with diabetes and cardiovascular disease. mets is defined as a high waist circumference in addition to two of the following: high triglycerides, low hdl and elevated blood pressure. other pathophysiologic changes are also observed including low grade inflammation, increased uric acid, prothrombotic state, elevated apob, small dense atherogenic ldl and endothelial dysfunction. first line treatment for mets is weight loss leading to reductions in insulin resistance. intensive lifestyle interventions reduce diabetes in high risk subjects. most lifestyle interventions for mets are predicated on the hypothesis that individuals can initiate and maintain weight loss by restricting calories and increasing physical activity. the diabetes prevention program showed that intensive intervention including a low_fat calorie reduced diet and increase in physical activity was associated 1.5 kg/m2 decrease in bmi and a 58 reduction in incidence of diabetes in individuals at high risk of diabetes. less intensive interventions are associated with more modest changes. a study of nutritional counselling was associated with a 0.4 kg/m2 decrease in bmi. thus, lifestyle interventions which emphasize eating less or exercising more have limited value. the optimal diet for subjects with mets has not been examined with hard end_points. small trials have compared carbohydrate restricted diets and low fat diets using surrogate markers. a trial of severely obese subjects found greater weight loss and greater improvements in lipid levels and hemoglobin a1c on carbohydrate restricted diet than low fat/calorie restricted diets. in a study of adults with mets, those randomized to the carbohydrate restriction had greater weight loss, lower triglycerides and lower insulin levels than individuals on a calorie restricted, low fat diet. these results are consistent with a meta_analysis where carbohydrate restricted diets were associated with improvements in atherogenic dyslipidemia, greater weight loss and better compliance than low fat, calorie restricted diets. these studies highlight the advantages of carbohydrate restriction. 1.2) fat, sugar and positions of major medical organizations one of the principal barriers to the widespread implementation of carbohydrate restricted diets is the fear that increase in saturated fat consumption with its association with increase in ldl_chol, will result in greater risk of cardiovascular disease (cvd). this diet_heart hypothesis has formed the cornerstone of dietary advice for prevention of chronic disease. the avoidance of saturated fat has led to general avoidance of dietary fat. there is weak and contradictory evidence that both saturated fat and dietary fat restriction are associated with health benefits. the largest test of the diet_heart hypothesis was the womens health initiative (whi). this study randomized women to either a low saturated fat diet or a regular diet. after 8 years, women randomized to the low fat diet had lower ldl_chol but no decrease in cvd mortality, incidence of breast or colorectal cancer. consistent with the results of the whi, a meta_analysis which included 347,747 subjects found no relationship between saturated fat intake and cvd. while most experts would agree that its too early to vindicate saturated fat as the foremost dietary evil, evidence is accumulating highlighting the obesigenic and atherogenic nature of refined carbohydrates. a trial aiming to decrease sweetened beverage consumption found the intervention group had 7.7 less overweight and obese children than controls. in nhanes (2006), consumption of added sugar was associated with higher triglycerides and lower hdl. a prospective study of dutch adults found that replacing 5 of calories from saturated fat with high glycemic carbohydrates was associated with a 33 increase in risk of myocardial infarction. the current state of scientific confusion over the health effects of (refined) carbohydrates is reflected in the diversity of dietary recommendations. american diabetes association (ada) dietary guidelines have suggested that carbohydrate restricted diets are an option for weight loss for up to 1 year. in contrast, canadian diabetes association recommends a diet with 45_60 of calories from carbohydrate with a sucrose intake up to 10 of daily intake. the contradictory nature of these positions highlights the need for more research into the health effects of carbohydrate restricted diets. the endorsement of carbohydrate restriction by ada suggests that these diets are valid therapeutic options. 1.3) shortcomings of the traditional obesity prevention paradigm the current obesity prevention paradigm emphasizes caloric reduction and/o increased physical activity to produce negative caloric balance. while physical activity has established benefits, increasing physical activity as a weight loss strategy has met with disappointing results. observational studies associating high levels of physical activity with lower adiposity are difficult to interpret as individuals with higher physical activity also benefit from other (unmeasured) health promoting behaviours. in randomized trials, physical activity interventions have shown equivocal results with respect to weight loss. the physiologic limitation of this approach is that it is difficult to augment physical activity without a compensatory increase in dietary intake. in studies where physical activity is directly supervised and in the absence of a compensatory increase in caloric intake, physical activity has been associated with weight loss 3 of initial body weight. in physical activity interventions of lower intensity, results are less promising. a meta_analysis of school based physical activity interventions in youth found no effect on bmi. the ineffectiveness of physical activity as a means of weight loss is reflected in the american heart association and american college of sports of sports medicine position statements where they recommend 60_90 minutes of moderate intensity activity/day to lose or maintain weight loss. not surprisingly, there is a very low prevalence of individuals who are moderately active for 60_90 minutes/day in the general population. ironically, insulin resistant individuals who would reap the greatest health benefits from physical activity may have a reduced physiologic tolerance for it as insulin resistance has been associated with reduced exercise tolerance through reversible changes in muscle mitochondria, reduced vo2 max and possibly other mechanisms. the failure of low fat, calorie restricted diets to curb the prevalence of obesity is exemplified by the whi. after 7.5 years of follow_up, the women randomized to the low fat group decreased their weight by 0.8 kg but had a 1 cm increase in waist circumference despite a reported decrease in caloric intake of 360 calories. weight loss in the low fat group was not different than women in the control group, who were consuming a typical american diet. calorie restricted diets emphasize the avoidance of energy dense foods high in dietary fat. while avoidance of dietary fat has intuitive appeal, calorie restriction is associated with a corresponding decrease in energy expenditure, in effect, stimulating a starvation response. the compensatory decrease in energy expenditure is associated with a plateauing of weight loss, an increased desire to eat and weight gain. low fat/high carbohydrate diets require weight loss to produce positive metabolic effects. this dependence on weight loss for health benefits combined with the inevitable rebound weight gain associated with this dietary strategy has the potential to worsen metabolic markers over the long term. the untoward metabolic changes associated with a high carbohydrate intake are particularly deleterious in individuals with mets. this contrasts with the physiologic effects of carbohydrate withdrawal in insulin resistant subjects that mirrors reversal of mets. in addition to improvements of mets, carbohydrate restricted diets are associated with less dense and therefore less atherogenic ldl particles and decreases in inflammatory markers. a final limitation of the current obesity prevention paradigm is that macronutrients (fat, protein and carbohydrates) are assumed to have equivalent metabolic effects. the investigators will review metabolic effects of macronutrients relating to the insulin response and energy balance. carbohydrates are potent secretagogues of insulin that is the primary regulator of adipose tissue metabolism and partitions dietary energy into either storage (higher insulin) or oxidation (lower insulin). mice genetically engineered to lack the insulin receptor on fat cells consume more calories per gram of body weight but are resistant to obesity. in ty e ii diabetics, administrations of exogenous insulin or drugs which stimulate insulin release from the pancreas are associated with weight gain. dietary fat has no effect on insulin secretion but delays gastric emptying. dietary protein lowers the glucose response to insulin 2_3 times more effectively than dietary fat and plays an important role in appetite suppression and potentially weight regulation. the addition of dietary fat, protein and fiber to dampen the untoward effects of dietary carbohydrate in a meal is the concept behind the glycemic index. low glycemic index diet may be of less relevance to type ii diabetics, however, as the effect of dietary fat and protein in blunting glucose responses is attenuated or absent. if obesity prevention is indeed evidence base then there are only two tools left in the public health arsenal, bariatric surgery or carbohydrate restriction. 1.4) why do carbohydrate restricted diets work there are at least two physiologic characteristics of carbohydrate restricted diets which contribute to weight loss. first, ad lib carbohydrate restricted diets have been associated with spontaneous reductions in caloric intake. second, these diets are associated with greater weight loss per calorie than low_fat diets with an unexplained caloric deficit of about 200 kcal/day. the preferential weight loss of carbohydrate restricted diets was termed the metabolic advantage. the concept of a metabolic advantage associated with carbohydrate restricted diets has been controversial among experts. while there is evidence supporting its existence in animal models and in humans, this phenomena remains poorly understood. ad lib carbohydrate restricted diets are often associated with spontaneous decreases in caloric intake. this is caused by the insulin lowering effects of carbohydrate restricted diets as high insulin levels have been associated with partitioning of metabolic fuels into adipose tissue and greater food intake. a trial of obese subjects found that those consuming a carbohydrate restricted diet had nearly a 30 decrease in fasting insulin levels and a 570 kcal decrease in energy intake. thus lower insulin levels are a key mediator between lower carbohydrate consumption and weight loss. a study in men found that 70 of the variability in weight loss from a carbohydrate restricted diet was explained by changes in fasting insulin. a number of trials have shown a metabolic advantage of carbohydrate restricted diets compared to low fat diets. there are three possible explanations. first, there might be greater energetic costs associated with metabolic interconversions of nutrients on carbohydrate restricted diets. second, individuals on a lower carbohydrate diet may have higher energy expenditure due to a greater resting metabolic rate and/or greater levels of physical activity. a final possibility is that lower weight loss is due to the selective under_reporting of dietary intake in individuals randomized to low fat diets. this latter explanation is not likely as this finding has been observed in numerous randomized controlled trials. diet induced thermogenesis may have a small contribution to the metabolic advantage of carbohydrate restricted diets. it accounts for 5_15 of total energy expenditure. the energetic costs to metabolize macronutrients vary from 2.5 with dietary fat, 7_15 with carbohydrate and 28_35 with protein. one study found that energy expenditure was 4 higher in a diet containing 30 compared to 10 of calories from protein. thus the modest increase in energy expenditure due to a higher protein intake would not likely be enough to account for the metabolic advantage of carbohydrate restricted diets. physical activity is the greatest modifiable source of energy expenditure. the hypothesis that the metabolic advantage of carbohydrate restricted diets could explain lower insulin levels associated with spontaneous increases in physical activity has received scant attention. this hypothesis is based on a number of well established observations. first, type ii diabet cs taking exogenous insulin have decreases in energy expenditure and weight gain. when insulin levels are lowered through carbohydrate restriction or pharmacotherapy there is an attendant loss of fat mass and some evidence for a modest increase in energy expenditure. a short study of obese individuals found that a ketogenic, low carbohydrate diet with a 30 decrease in insulin resistance was associated with a 20 increase in resting energy_expenditure, though physical activity was not assessed in this study. similarly, in a 6 month randomized trial of obese women, those on the carbohydrate restricted diet had a non_significant 5 increase in resting energy expenditure per kg of body weight compared to baseline. this study also assessed physical activity using pedometers and found no difference in steps/day between the carbohydrate restricted group and the low_fat group despite a 3.7kg greater weight loss in the former and no difference in reported caloric intake between groups. measurement of physical activity in free_living individuals is complex. pedometers are an objective assessment of physical activity but are unable to assess intensity, frequency and duration of activity. they are also unsuitable for estimation of energy expenditure. in summary, intensive lifestyle interventions reduce the incidence of type ii diabetes in individuals with metabolic syndrome. central to the therapeutic effect of these interventions is weight loss. there is a lack of consensus over what constitutes best practices for lifestyle interventions. physical activity is associated with numerous health benefits but is not an efficacious prescription for weight loss or weight maintenance. moreover, the optimal dietary prescription is controversial some experts suggest individuals with mets should restrict their dietary fat intake while other experts suggest dietary carbohydrate should be restricted. this controversy in dietary prescription is reflected in the positions of major medical organizations. the american diabetes association has endorsed carbohydrate restriction for weight loss since 2008. the canadian diabetes association, however, favours lower glycemic index foods and the restriction of dietary fat. despite the equivocal evidence, a low fat, calorie restricted diet coupled with increased physical activity are considered the standard lifestyle interventions for mets. 2. objectives this protocol has three aims. first, the investigators hypothesize that adherence to a lower carbohydrate diet in individuals with mets, resulting in lower insulin resistance will cause an increase in levels of spontaneous physical activity, independent of changes in weight. second, the investigators will examine changes in cardiometabolic risk factors (apob, tg, hdl, blood pressure, crp) when individuals are randomized to either a carbohydrate restricted diet or a low fat/high carbohydrate diet. finally, the investigators will interview a sub_sample of participants from both study arms (5 in each arm) to conduct open_ended interviews to better understand quality of life issues with respect to the dietary assignment or lifestyle intervention. 3. research plan our group has generated cross_sectional data showing a clinically meaningful association between higher carbohydrate intake and lower physical activity, assessed by accelerometer in glucose intolerant individuals. the limitation of these findings relate to the inability to assess causality that is, if carbohydrate restriction causes increases in physical activity. the strength of the actout study is its ability to delineate causal direction using a prospective design and randomization to control for known and unknown confounders. study design and participants: study participants will be randomized to an ad lib carbohydrate restricted group or a low fat, calorie reduced diet for 6 months. the investigators will recruit individuals with metabolic syndrome (mets) from st. pauls metabolic syndrome program. inclusion criteria include a diagnosis of mets defined as an increased waist cir umference and two or more of the following: fasting blood sugar greater than 5.6 mmol/l, fasting triglycerides greater than 1.7 mmol/l, high density lipoprotein (hdl) less than 1.0 mmol/l in men and less than 1.3 mmol/l in women and blood pressure greater than 135/85 or on antihypertensive medication. potential participants will be excluded if they are following a weight reducing diet, are abusing alcohol or other psychoactive substances, are on psychiatric medication associated with weight gain or have plans to travel during the study period. randomization: the investigators will use block randomization to prevent the biasing of the randomization process. after each block of subjects is enrolled, the investigators will use a computerized randomization program to randomly assign participants to one of the two dietary assignments. due to the difficulty in concealing the dietary assignment, the randomized trial will not be blinded as both researchers and participants will be aware of their dietary assignment. to minimize the contamination of study groups, individual and group sessions will be scheduled at different times. control group: the control group will be randomized to the intensive lifestyle intervention currently used by the healthy heart program at st. pauls hospital to reduce symptoms associated with metabolic syndrome. participants will be instructed to replace high fat, energy dense foods with foods rich in whole grains, fruits and vegetables. the macronutrient distribution of this diet will be approximately 55 carbohydrate, 15 protein and 30 fat. individuals will also be instructed to reduce sodium intake to 2300 mg/day and in individuals with hypertension, 1500 mg/day. at the end of the study, participants will have the option to continue on either of the study diets. measurement of body composition and estimation of resting energy expenditure: sample size calculation: to calculate sample size the investigators used cross_sectional data with accelerometer measured physical activity and excellent quantitative measures of diet. the investigators assumed a 15 difference in calories consumed as carbohydrates between the dietary treatments. with a significance value of p 0.05 (two sided test) the investigators found that 27 participants would be required in each group to detect a significant difference in accelerometer measured intensity of activity. to account for possible attrition the investigators will overestimate the sample size by 10 in each arm. the investigators will recruit 72 individuals with 36 in each arm. based on our sample size calculation, the investigators expect to detect time and diet based differences in addition to a diettime interaction. recruitment strategy: the investigators will recruit individuals with metabolic syndrome from the metabolic syndrome program. flyers will be posted in the waiting room and the examination rooms of the program. flyers will also be given to the administrative assistants responsible for intake of participants into the program who may choose to notify participants of the study. if a potential participant expresses interest the coordinator will explain the study in sufficient detail to enable informed consent. to assess diet prior to inclusion into the study the investigators will ask potential participants to complete a 3 day diet history and wear the accelerometer for 7 days to ensure that they are not already following a weight reducing diet and to assess baseline physical activity. individuals compliant with both the dietary recall and baseline assessment of physical activity will be randomized into one of the two dietary assignments. carbohydrate restricted diet: participants will be instructed to restrict carbohydrate consumption to 20 grams/day while not restricting their caloric intake. participants will be encouraged to consume vegetables with low carbohydrate content every day including 2 cups of salad greens and 1 cup of vegetables that grow above the ground. one of the physiologic changes associated with a low carbohydrate intake is loss of salt through the urine. if salt is not replaced participants may experience headaches, nausea, dizziness, lethargy and constipation. participants will be counselled to increase their salt intake. this has been shown to correct the natiuresis associated with carbohydrate restriction which can cause the aforementioned side effects. participants will be advised to continue their baseline level of physical activity. methods to ensure compliance to the dietary assignment: the study coordinator will facilitate activities to support compliance to the dietary assignment, either one_on_one or in a group setting. group meetings will reinforce compliance by sharing cooking tips, behaviour modification and relapse prevention strategies. in the one_on_one sessions, the study coordinator will review 3 day food records and discuss strategies to increase compliance. participants from both groups will meet with their clinician after 3 months to assess health indicators and to assure participants of the safety of their dietary assignment. qualitative interviews: the investigators will conduct hour long open_ended interviews with 8_10 participants from the study to understand the lived experience of a prudent diet and a carbohydrate restricted diet. interviews will be recorded and transcribed. the investigators will use grounded theory to look for theories which emerge from the data as opposed to having interpreting the data with an a priori analysis. the investigators will then assign descriptive categories to themes which emerge from the data, such themes could include: effect of their diet on diabetes, perceptions of hunger, mood etc. these descriptive categories will then be placed into thematic categories and analyzed in light of the existing of the literature. the investigators will use bioelectrical impedance to assess body composition at baseline and at 6 months. bioelectrical impedance has been shown to provide a reasonable assessment of body composition compared to dxa, which is considered a gold standard. the investigators will normalize fat mass and fat_free mass to height by using a fat_mass index and a fat_free mass index (kg/m2), respectively. height will be measured with a stadiometer at baseline. waist circumference will be assessed at baseline and at 6 months, after exhalation, using a flexible tape measure half way between the hip bone and the lowest rib. the investigators will estimate energy expenditure using previously published equations which take into account fat_free mass, fat mass, gender and age. questionnaire: the investigators will use the applied health indicators questionnaire and the patient health questionnaire, to collect relevant health information from the patient. these self_administered questionnaires will be completed at baseline, 3 and 6 months. physical activity assessment: participants will wear an accelerometer to assess physical activity at baseline and week of every month for 6 months. an accelerometer is a small electronic monitor worn on the waist that measures vertical accelerations and is thus considered an objective measure of physical activity. patients will be instructed to wear the accelerometer during waking hours for 1 week of every month, exclusive of time spent bathing or when in water. data will be downloaded in one_minute epochs and categorized as light, moderate or vigorous activity. days will be excluded when the accelerometer is worn for less than 80 of the average time worn on the other days. the investigators will estimate activity_based energy expenditure using previously validated equations. as accelerometers do not capture activity associated with cycling, swimming or skiing the investigators will ask participants about the number of times they did these activities in the period that they wore the accelerometer. cardiometabolic indices: blood samples will be drawn and placed in individually labelled tubes with edta, centrifuged immediately and stored at _70c. as changes in insulin action are central to our hypothesis the investigator will assess two distinct aspects of insulin metabolism in this study, insulin secretion and insulin resistance. the investigators will assess insulin resistance using homa assessment of insulin resistance calculated from fasting insulin and fasting glucose. the investigators will assess the concentration of c_peptide, a cleavage product related to insulin synthesis that is synthesized in equimolar concentrations to insulin. as c_peptide has a longer half_life than insulin, it can be used a marker of insulin secretion from the pancreas. blood pressure will be assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months using bp_tru monitors. lipid, lipoprotein and c_reactive protein levels will be measured at baseline, 3 and 6 months. total cholesterol, triglyceride, high_density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein b will be measured using previously described methods. ldl_chol levels will be calculated using the friedewald formula for patients whose plasma triglyceride level is less than 4 mmol/l. __hydroxybutyrate will also be assessed in both groups at the aforementioned time points and will be used as a biomarker of adherence to a carbohydrate restricted diet. the investigators will also assess serum leptin and uric acid at baseline and 6 months. statistical analyses: the investigators will use two different approaches to analyze the data. first the investigators will use an intention to treat analysis using baseline values to impute missing data in participants who may drop_out of the study. the investigators will also examine the effect of the dietary assignment on outcomes in participants who were compliant with their dietary assignment. baseline characteristics will be compared between the two groups using t tests. the investigators will examine three inter_related dependent variables, capturing different aspects of physical activity, in the analysis strategy. first, the investigators will examine the association between dietary assignment and changes in accelerometer variables. the investigators will also examine time spent in moderate_to_vigorous physical activity and activity based energy expenditure. as activity based energy will be estimated from accelerometer , the investigators will not consider it a unique comparison. the investigators will thus set the level of statistical significance at p0.025 to adjust for multiple comparisons. the investigators will obtain differences in key variables such as physical activity and change in insulin concentration. to assess the effects of the dietary assignment on physical activity, the investigators will use three_way repeated_measures anova, including change in body weight in the model with time as the repeated factor.",479,1.0
483,nct,effects of noradrenaline administration combined with restrictive intraoperative fluid substitution on perioperative outcome in patients undergoing radical cystectomy,2011,,cn-02021142,"background perioperative fluid management in abdominal surgery is a subject of controversy and current standard fluid therapy is not evidence based. standard fluid therapy includes replacement of basic fluid requirements, loss by perspiration, by exsudation through the surgical wound, and loss into the third space. in animal experiments on pigs, high (18ml/kg/h) or low (3ml/kg/h) volume crystalloid fluid treatment had no effect on colon tissue oxygenation tension. three different fluid volume regimens (3ml/kg/h, 7 ml/kg/h and 20ml/kg/h) tested did not affect tissue oxygen pressure in the jejunum and colon, suggesting efficient autoregulation of intestinal blood flow in healthy pigs undergoing uncomplicated abdominal surgery 25. noradrenaline increased systemic blood flow (mean arterial pressure and cardiac index) and failed to increase microcirculatory blood flow in most abdominal organs in septic pigs. thoracic epidural anesthesia per se does not affect intravascular volume. therefore, vasopressors are preferable for treatment of hypotension after epidural anesthesia. the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction varies greatly with reported rates of 10 to 55. patient characteristics such as age, education, type and length of surgical procedure and preoperative cognitive status have been found to affect the incidence and severity of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. the influence of intraoperative volume management on cognitive function has not been assessed. it seems of interest and safe to use a noradrenaline perfusor combined with a low volume regimen during open radical cystectomy. the low volume regimen, as described in this study protocol, is well established in our institution, which has a large experience in cystectomy. objective the aim of this study is to compare intraoperative blood loss, quality of the surgical field (defined later), metabolic response, pain relief, fatigue score, gastrointestinal function, cardiovascular, pulmonary, infectious and surgical complications and cognitive function in two groups of patients undergoing radical cystectomy. the first group will be treated according to an internationally accepted standard fluid regimen (6 ml/kg/h of crystalloids and correction of the hypotony with fluid boluses) the second one will be treated with a restrictive fluid regimen of 2ml/kg/h of crystalloids in combination with sympathicomimetics. methods prospective, randomised, controlled, single_centre study. randomly assigned in equal proportion by computer to receive the dry regimen 2ml/kg/h combined with sympathicomimetics or the standard fluid management. an advanced balanced electrolyte solution will be used containing acetate/malate instead of lactate. substantial advantages are a base excess of /_ o mmol/l, that it is isotonic, and contains anions acetate and malate. 208 patients with open radical cystectomy duration: 36 months setting: university department of urology , inselspital bern, switzerland study sample and power calculation a power analysis for postoperative complication rate as primary outcome has been done with the ncss pass programme: power: 80 significance: 0.05 or lower complication rate for the restrictive volume regimen group: 20 complication rate for the control group: 38 83 patients will be required in each group. assuming a 20 drop_out rate 104 patients per group will be enrolled. fluid preload before spinal or just after epidural anaesthesia is a common and recognized practice in clinical anaesthesia. vasodilatation is a well_known side effect of halogenics, of most hypnotics and opiates. compensating decreasing blood pressure by volume substitution is common praxis. alternatively the fall in blood pressure due to vasodilatation can be corrected by applying vasoactive agents. a review of the data on the effect of high volume perioperative fluid therapy suggests that overhydration may have deleterious effects on cardiopulmonary function (excessive shift to the right on the starling myocardial performance curve, pneumonia and respiratory fai ure) as well as on recovery of gastrointestinal motility (prolonged postoperative ileus (pi)), tissue oxygenation and wound healing (anastomosis leakage). a postoperative weight gain of 3_7 kg in patients after major elective surgery therefore seems to represent a genuine fluid overload. delay in bowel motility may be due to the presence of excess fluid in the intestinal wall resulting from excess perioperative fluid therapy. increased gut permeability after surgical trauma may also contribute to the development of pi because of enhanced uptake of luminal bacterial products. postoperative complications were significantly reduced by restricted fluid therapy. a dose response relation between administrated fluid volume and postoperative complications (cardiopulmonary and tissue healing) was found in a randomised assessor blinded multicenter trial for colorectal surgery 11,12. the restricted fluid regimen did not lead to haemodynamic instability and the amount of vasoactive substances administered was similar. no significant difference in urinary output was demonstrated on days 1 and 6. restrictive fluid administration in fast_track surgery led to no differences in all_over recovery after colonic surgery. goal_directed intraoperative fluid administration using the oesophageal doppler monitor to maintain maximal stroke volume has been shown to reduce the length of hospital stay, lower the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting and to encourage an early return of bowel function. oesophageal doppler monitor permits rapid, minimally invasive and continuous estimation of cardiac output. it can be easily inserted and is not associated with major complications. the investigators will use oesophageal doppler monitoring for intraoperative monitoring of stroke volume and cardiac output.",480,1.0
484,nct,multimodal analgesic using morphine and cox-2 with or without dexmedetomidine for colorectal surgery,2011,,cn-01486485,"procedures: patients will be approached at the pre_admission clinic or in the general ward before operation. the analgesic modalities will be explained and patient will be recruited into study if s/he agrees. patient will then be randomised into one of the two groups receiving intraoperative morphine with dexmedetomidine then postoperative pca morphine (d), or intraoperative morphine only then postoperative pca morphine (m). randomisation, blinding, and preparation of dexmedetomidine and placebo patients who undergo open and laparoscopic colonic and rectal surgery will be stratified in randomisation. for each type of operation (colonic and rectal), randomisation will be based on using blocks of 5 patients to ensure both groups having equal sample size. a computer_generated random sequence will be used to select the allocation order. both patients and investigators will be blinded to the allocated analgesic modalities, i.e. the administration of dexmedetomidine. dexmedetomidine or normal saline (placebo) will be prepared by clinical staff who will not participate in observation and data analysis. for group d, dexmedetomidine will be prepared by adding 2ml of the drug (100_g/ml) to 48ml of 0.9 sodium chloride injection, which make up to a total of 50ml. the final concentration for administration is thus 200_g in 50ml, i.e. 4_g/ml. for group m, a syringe of 50ml normal saline will be prepared as placebo. as both dexmedetomidine and placebo will look the same as 50ml clear liquid in syringe, both patient and investigator will be blinded to the substance administered. preoperative care: the patients will be assessed at pre_admission clinic or at the general ward. blood for soluble cd40l with other routine investigations will be taken. bowel preparation will start one day before operation. patient will fast since midnight before operation. anaesthesia and intraoperative care: both groups of patients will be anaesthetised according to the protocol as follow: patient will receive no sedative premedication. on arrival in the operation theatre, a 16_gauge intravenous cannula will be placed under local analgesic. pulse, pulse oximetry and non_invasive blood pressure measurement will be checked every 5 minutes throughout the operation. propofol 2mg/kg, fentanyl 1.5_g/kg and atracurium 0.5mg/kg will be used for general anaesthesia induction. anaesthesia will be maintained with mixture of isoflurane, air and oxygen. isoflurane concentration will be titrated to optimal heart rate and blood pressure by the anaesthesiologist. thermal blanket and infusion fluid warmer will be used to aim at maintaining core body temperature at 35.5 to 37.5 degrees celsius. a urinary catheter will be inserted to monitor urine output. intermittent pneumatic compression device will be applied to the lower limbs for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. at the discretion of the anaesthesiologist, hypotension will be treated with intravenous ephedrine or phenylephrine. hypertension or tachycardia will be treated with isoflurane up to 2 end_tidal concentration ( 1.5 mac). if persisted, beta_blockers such as labetalol or arterial vasodilators such as hydralazine may be given. analgesic modalities and pain assessment: procedures for the two analgesic modalities are described below: from postoperative day 0, rescue analgesic in the form of intramuscular pethidine 0.5mg/kg will be prescribed every 4 hours if necessary. after pca morphine has stopped, nrs pain scores at rest and during cough, dose and frequency of rescue analgesia used will be charted once a day until discharge. postoperative care and assessment: early mobilisation is encouraged after operation. on postoperative day 1, patient will be put on fluid diet. isoflurane will be switched off after closure of the inner layer of the wounds. reversal will be achieved by intravenous neostigmine 50_g/kg and atropine 20_g/kg after operation. patient will then be transferred to recovery room for monitoring for at least 1 hour. group d: intraoperative morphine with dexmedetomidine then pos operative pca morphine. patient will receive a loading dose of 1_g/kg (0.25ml/kg) intravenous dex_medetomidine over 10 minutes before induction, and then followed by continuous infusion at a rate of 0.5_g/kg/h (0.125ml/kg/h) until wound closure. bolus dose of 0.1mg/kg morphine sulphate will be given intravenously prior to incision. at the third and forth hour, morphine sulphate 0.1mg/kg may be given in divided dose titrated to patients response. on arrival in the recovery room, boluses of 2mg intravenous morphine will be given every 5 minutes until nrs pain score is less than 4. a pca machine will then be connected. the machine will be configured to give 1mg of morphine at a time and the lockout duration will be set to 5 minutes. no basal infusion will be given and the maximum dose limit will be 0.1mg/kg per hour. group m: intraoperative morphine then postoperative pca morphine. all procedures for group d patients will be followed, but dexmedetomidine administration will be replaced by placebo (normal saline) of the same volume and rate. both groups: starting from postoperative day 1, when patient resumes fluid diet, oral celecoxib 200mg will be given twice daily for 3 days or until discharge, whichever earlier. from day 4 onwards, one tablet of dologesic (paracetamol plus dextropropoxyphene) will be given every 4 hours as needed until discharge. during the administration of pca morphine, respiratory rate, spo2 and sedation score will be monitored every hour blood pressure and pulse, numerical rating scale (nrs) pain scores at rest and during cough, cumulative doses and tries/goods, as well as side effects will be recorded every 4 hours. patient will be seen by anaesthesiologist every day to assess the adequacy of analgesia. pca morphine will be administered for at least 2 days. on postoperative day 2, if nrs pain scores during cough is less than 4 on a clinically low morphine consumption, pca will be stopped if equals or greater than 4, or still on a high pca consumption, it will be continued. assessment will be repeated daily. if nrs pain score during cough remains at 4 or above on day 5, patient will be evaluated for complications and managed at the discretion of the anaesthesiologist. the surgical team will be responsible for postoperative assessments, such as recording daily gastrointestinal function (bowel sound, flatus and bowel opening), postoperative complications (if any) and readiness for discharging patient (good pain control with oral analgesics, ambulatory, resumption of bowel function, i.e. stool or flatus, have 2 to 3 feeds without vomiting or abdominal distension). blood for soluble cd40l and other routine investigations will be taken at post_operative day 2. patients satisfaction on analgesia will be asked using nrs from zero to 10 upon discharge. data collection: the following data will be collected: _ demographics _ time of admission _ type of colorectal surgery and incision _ intraoperative vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, pulse oximetry) _ estimated intraoperative blood loss _ volume of intraoperative fluid/blood

485,nct,goal directed therapy for patients undergoing major vascular surgery,2011,,cn-02023527,"the management and delivery of intravenous fluids during surgical operations is one of the important duties for anesthesiologists. there is a growing body of evidence that fluid overload in surgical patients is associated with decreased wound healing, slower return of gut function, anastomotic breakdown, pulmonary edema and post_operative visual changes. in the united states, abdominal aortic aneurysms are diagnosed in 190,000 people per year, and over 50,000 of those have the aneurysm repaired5. recent advances in endovascular techniques have allowed many of these patients to forego an open repair. however, because of technical difficulties, many patients still require an open repair. the most common cause of morbidity in these patients is related to post_operative gastrointestinal tract dysfunction. this usually involves an adynamic ileus that the patients develop on the fourth post_operative day. this delays their tolerance of enteral foods and lengthens their hospital stay and hospital costs. it also has the potential of causing more morbidity in that patients may require total parenteral nutrition while awaiting return of bowel function. there are several causes of this gastrointestinal morbidity including direct mechanical trauma to the bowel during surgery and activation of the inflammatory cascade. these factors are unfortunately not modifiable by the team caring for the patient. one factor that is modifiable is the amount and type of intravenous fluids administered to the patient. typically, anesthesiologists decide on the amount of fluid to administer to patients based on parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure and urine output. these are unfortunately unreliable in determining a patients volume status, as these parameters can be within the normal range, and a patient might still have inadequate perfusion to their vital organs. further, clinicians reliance on blood pressure as a target for fluid administration ignores the fact that organs require blood flow as well as pressure to function optimally. until recently, the only way to measure blood flow was with the insertion of a pulmonary artery catheter. based on several studies showing a lack of benefit of this invasive procedure, it has fallen out of favor in the non_cardiac arena. newer monitors of cardiac output that can be attached to a patients arterial catheter (commonly placed for major surgical procedures) offer an alternative method for clinicians to measure cardiac output. all of these studies have in common the use of a minimally invasive co monitor and a reliance on colloids as the predominant fluid utilized during the case. the utilization of svv to determine volume status is a novel approach to fluid management in surgical patients. as stated above, clinicians historical reliance on pressures (such as as blood pressure and central venous pressure) to estimate intravascular volume status is based on an incomplete understanding on the factors that govern organ blood flow. to this end, the investigators will also assess several parameters during this study in an attempt to ascertain which is the best at predicting fluid responsiveness. fluid responsiveness is defined as the ability to predict if a given patient will increase their co to a fluid bolus. to date this has not been looked at in a systematic fashion. one of these monitors, the flotrac system (edwards life sciences, irvine ca), utilizes the arterial pulse contour to calculate cardiac output (co) and the stroke volume variation (svv) as a monitor of volume status. in patients who are mechanically ventilated there is a phasic variation in co and stroke volume based on the ventilatory cycle. large changes in stroke volume during the ventilatory cycle may indicate hypovolemia in patients. the administration of intravenous fluid to these patients results in a decrease in the svv. thus, the svv can be use a volume monitor and used to titrate intravenous therapy. there have been several trials (mostly in colonic resection surgery) that have looked at such goal directed ther py with this and similar devices and have found a decrease in patient morbidity and length of stay. there is also evidence to suggest that such goal directed therapy reduces the degree of inflammation that invariably occurs after operations of this magnitude. it is hypothesized that by resuscitating the endothelium more effectively with intravenous fluids that remain in the intravascular space longer, there is less endothelial damage and thus less inflammation.",482,1.0
486,nct,bariatric surgery and reactive hypoglycemia,2012,,cn-02034793,"introduction geltrude mingrone,simona panunzi, andrea de gaetano, caterina guidone, celestino pio lombardi, marco raffaelli,rocco bellantone departments of internal medicine, surgery and biomathematics of the catholic university of rome, italy the overall prevalence of grade 2 and 3 adult obesity (bmi 35 kg/m2) derived from the 2009_2010 national health and nutrition examination survey (nhanes) exceeded 15 and grade 3 obesity (bmi 40 kg/m2) accounted for 6.3 (1). the dietary approach is modestly satisfactory in the short term and weight regain is practically the rule in the long run as a consequence of the scarce compliance to the diet shown by the obese subjects. in fact, in a recent study (2) where different types of diets were assigned to a population of overweight and obese subjects (bmi from 25 to 40 kg/m2), an average of 6 kg, corresponding to 7 of the initial body weight, was lost in the first 6 months, but the weight was regained after 1 year and at 2 years, only 31_37 of the participants had lost 5 of their initial weight. bariatric surgery has long been recognized as an effective treatment for grade 3 or grade 2 obesity associated with complications (3) and, accordingly, the number of bariatric operations in the united states is growing over time from ca. 10,000 in the early 1990s to 103,000 in 2003 (4). bariatric surgery allows to type 2 diabetes remission (5,6) while improving several other serious comorbidities (7). among the bariatric surgical procedures, roux_en_y gastric bypass (rygb) was shown to account for 41 of all bariatric operations at least in the united sates (8). sleeve gastrectomy (sg), that was conceived as the first step before performing a rygb or a biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch in patients who were super_obese (9), has recently emerged as a new restrictive bariatric procedure (10). it was noticed that sg determines a weight loss similar to that achieved after rygb (11) and larger than that following laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (12,13). reactive hypoglycemia is a late complication of rygb although it seems to occur also after sg. after rygb insulin secretion is enhanced early after an oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt) (14) or a meal (15,16) and might explain the later reactive hypoglycemia. an increasing number of reports highlight the occurrence of severe hypoglycemia after rygb including neuroglycopenia that is attributed to nesidioblastosis (17_20). roslin et al (21) found that 72, i.e. 26 out of 36 patients operated of rygb 6 months earlier, had reactive hypoglycemia at 2 hours after an ogtt (100 g of glucose), which was defined as an absolute serum glucose level 60 mg/dl, or a drop of 100 mg/dl in serum glucose level in 1 h. as compared with rygb, sg seems to have a much lower occurrence of reactive hypoglycemia, ca. 3, i.e. 1 out of 31 patients studied at 6 weeks after the operation (22). fortunately, the frequency of severe hypoglycemia or related symptoms requiring hospitalization after rygb is pretty low, the adjusted hazard ratios were in fact 2.7 for hypoglycemia, 2.8 for confusion, 4.9 for syncope, 3.0 for epilepsy and 7.3 for seizures (23) in a swedish cohort study based on national registries with 5,040 operated persons (23). the primary aim of the present study is to conduct a 1_year randomized trial to compare the incidence of hypoglycemia after rygb or sg. study objective secondary objectives experimental design study end_points primary end_point the primary endpoint of the study is the incidence reactive hypoglycemia at 1 year after the bariatric surgery. secondary end_points _ changes at 1 year of insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion measured after an ogtt. _ changes at 1 year of body weight, bmi, abdominal circumference, body composition, lipid profile and cardiovascular system abnormalities. however, until now no prospective studies have investigated the incidence of hypoglycemia after rygb nor randomized studies have been undertaken to compare the effect of sg to that of rygb in terms of i cidence of hypoglycemic episodes. primary objective the primary objective of the study is to verify whether sg decrease the percentage of patients presenting with reactive hypoglycemia with respect to rygb within 1 years after the bariatric operation. _ to quantify the relative contribution of changes in insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion measured after an ogtt to the glycemic effect of bariatric surgery and to determine if differences exist between the two surgical treatments. _ to determine whether treatment is associated with body weight, bmi and abdominal circumference loss and with body composition, as assessed by dexa, as well as with lipid profile and cardiovascular system abnormalities. _ to assess the occurrence of severe hypoglycemia or related symptoms (shakiness, sweating, dizziness or light_headedness, confusion, difficulty speaking, weakness, confusion, syncope, epilepsy, seizures) within 5 years after the operation and determine whether sg decrease its incidence. _ the incidence of severe hypoglycemia or related symptoms (shakiness, sweating, dizziness or light_headedness, confusion, difficulty speaking, weakness, confusion, syncope, epilepsy, seizures) within 5 years after the operation. experimental plan this is a monocentric prospective controlled randomized clinical trial designed to investigate if the sg reduces the incidence of reactive hypoglycemia with respect to rygb within 1 years after the bariatric operation. at the moment of the screening visit subjects will be randomized to be undergone either the sg or the rygb surgical procedure. study design diagram the diagram of the study plan is as follows: screening visit (_18 weeks) baseline visit (_4 weeks) follow_up visit (1 month) follow_up visit (3 months) follow_up visit (6 months) follow_up visit (9 months) follow_up visit (12 months) written informed consent demographic data medical and surgical history physical examination height weight, bmi waist and hip circumference dexa blood pressure and heart rate ecg laboratory assessments ogtt adverse events recording concomitant medication an overview of all planned blood samples, including volumes and purpose is provided in table 2. study duration subjects will be studied from the time of screening visit to 1 year after the surgical procedure and will undergo four distinct phases: _ screening visit (week _18) _ baseline visit (week _4) _ a follow_up period after the surgical treatment (1 year of duration, month 1, 3, 6, 9, 12) _ a further follow_up period after study conclusion (4 years of duration) screening visit at week _18, eligible patients are identified and the written informed consent is obtained. demographic data, anthropometric measures, physical examination and information about medical history, concomitant medication and variables related to inclusion criteria are collected. basal visit at week _4 patients at the screening visit will be asked to return for the baseline visit and they will be asked to give their informed consent to randomization. study compliance will be assessed during the screening and baseline periods using attendance at appointments and completion of questionnaires. baseline anthropometric measures, body composition, blood pressure, and biochemical data (levels of fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin hba1c, c_peptide, and serum insulin, lipid profile and oral glucose tolerance test) are measured. _ safety reasons as judged by principal investigator follow_up period one month after the bariatric surgery and each 3 months until 1 year after the surgical treatment (month 1, 3, 6, 9, 12) all the collected variables at baseline will be recorded and an ogtt will be performed. adverse events will be recorded at each follow_up visit. study conclusion and a further follow_up period at the conclusion of the a study a conclusion form will be filled in and patients will be followed up to 5 years after the surgical treatment. study population sample size the sample size depends on the magnitude of the d fference in reactive hypoglycemia incidence as derived from previous studies (21) and (22). the study is designed to detect a more conservative absolute difference in the occurrence of hypoglycemia of 50, expecting an incidence of 70 in the rygb group versus an incidence of 20 in the sg group. a sample size of 19 patients per group would be required for this clinical trial to detect an improvement data significance level of 0.05 and a power of 0.90. considering an attrition rate of 25 over the course of the study a total of 50 subjects (25 for each group) will be enrolled. an amendment to enlarge the number of patients to 120, 60 in each arm, was approved by the ethical committee on november 2012. for a more conservative estimate in fact, we have reduced the percent difference between the two groups from 50 to 30 considering the incidence of reactive hypoglycemia to be 50 in rygb and to 20 in sg instead of 70 and 20 respectively. in this way, the number of patients to be allocated in each arm is 50 with a power of 90. considering an attrition rate of 20 the number of patients in each group will be 60 and, thus, overall 120. secondary endpoints for cgm and insulin sensitivity and secretion are evaluated in a subset of 50 patients, 25 in each group, but can be also extended to entire sample. selection study population patients will be recruited from the outpatient clinics and day hospital of obesity of the catholic university of rome, italy. the study will be subject to revision and approval by the ethical committee of the above institution in accordance with the guidelines of the national health ministry and the helsinki declaration, as revised in 2000. all participants will provide written informed consent to participate in the study. additional written informed consent will be obtained prior to the surgical procedure. inclusion criteria patients are eligible if aged between 25 and 65 years, have a body mass index of 35 (in presence of complications as sleep apnea, severe coxarthritis or gonarthritis, severe hypertension) to 50 kg/m2, and are able to understand and comply with the study process. exclusion criteria _ history of type 1 diabetes or secondary diabetes _ previous bariatric surgery _ history of medical problems such as mental impairment _ major cardiovascular disease _ major gastrointestinal disease _ major respiratory disease _ hormonal disorders _ infection _ history of drug addiction and/or alcohol abuse _ internal malignancy _ pregnancy _ impaired glucose tolerance _ suspected or confirmed poor compliance _ informed consents participants will be excluded if they did not attend at least 2 initial information visits. treatment surgical program within 1 month of randomization the patients will undergo rygb or sg. an entero_entero anastomosis, with a roux_en_y type of reconstruction, allows the bile and pancreatic juices to mix with the nutrients at about 100_150 cm from the gastro_jejunal connection. criteria for discontinuation and/or withdrawal criteria for discontinuation: _ withdrawal of informed consent _ subject uncooperative roux_en_y gastric bypass this laparoscopic operation includes the division of the stomach in two parts. a proximal, smaller pouch (20_25 cc volume), is connected to the rest of the gastrointestinal tract through a gastro_jejunal anastomosis, whereas the distal gastric pouch is left behind but excluded from the transit of food. sleeve gastrectomy laparoscopic sg involves a longitudinal resection of the stomach on the greater curvature from the antrum starting opposite of the nerve of latarjet up to the angle of his the final gastric volume is about 100 ml. randomization process automatic dynamic allocation of the treatment to the patients will be performed via a web_based software. the randomization procedure via internet is an automatic and flexible mechanism that on one hand guarantees random allocation and on the other hand reduces imbalance with respect to the two treatment groups over the two consider d stratification factors: gender and age (18_40 and 40_60). the mechanism may be accessed from any web_connected computer it clears the user for data access (userid/password) it requires the user to specify the screening number of the subject about to be randomized it verifies inclusion/exclusion criteria and acquires stratification information it finally assigns the subject to a treatment, and delivers the corresponding unique randomization number. the procedure optimizes the overall balance of treatments among each stratification cell. the allocation algorithm will be verified by the responsible statistician for the study, who will have continuing access to the randomization statistics throughout the duration of the study. _ non_compliance to the protocol _ incorrect enrolment _ subjects who could not be operated laparoscopically _ conditions requiring medication that could interfere with the outcome of the study except those for intercurrent illnesses or adjustment of anti_hypertensive therapy as judged by the principal investigator _ subjects with severe complications due to the surgery as judged by the principal investigator _ bleedings related to surgery that make it impossible to draw blood samples subjects may be discontinued from the study at any time, at the discretion of the investigator. subjects are free to discontinue their participation in the study at any time. subjects who discontinue from the study should always be asked about the reason(s) for the discontinuation. if possible, they should always be seen and assessed by an investigator. adverse events will be followed up according to national requirements. if a subject discontinues participation in the study, then his enrolment number cannot be issued to another subject. efficacy evaluation in order to evaluate the effect of the sleeve gastrectomy versus the roux_en_y gastric bypass on the glycemic control the following parameters will be considered: primary endpoint primary endpoint: incidence of reactive hypoglycemia at 1 year after the bariatric surgery. secondary end_points _ changes at 1 year of insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion measured by means of an ogtt. _ changes at 1 year of body weight, bmi, abdominal circumference, body composition and lipid profile. _ the incidence of severe hypoglycemia or related symptoms (shakiness, sweating, dizziness or light_headedness, confusion, difficulty speaking, weakness, confusion,

evaluation and assessment the safety of the surgical procedures will be evaluated at the end of the study analyzing all the information recorded in the case report form suitably designed for the study, according to the timing and modalities described in other sections of the present protocol. information to assess the safety will include: objective exam, patients symptoms related to the operation, occurrence of adverse events. safety parameters adverse events the clinical tolerability will be evaluated by recording of the occurrence of adverse events as reported by the patient or observed by the medical investigator. any adverse event occurred after the surgical treatment will have to be recorded in the case report form. definitions an adverse event (ae) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject undergone a treatment and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. an ae can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, or related to the surgical procedure. pre_existing events, which increase in frequency or severity, or change in nature during or as a consequence of use of a drug in human clinical trials, will also be considered as aes. a serious adverse event (sae) is defined as any adverse event regardless of causality that led to a death, led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that resulted in a life_threatening illness or injury, resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, required in_patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment to body structure or a body function. led to fatal distress or fatal death. a serious adverse device effect (ade) is a serious adverse event related to the adopted device (in the specific case the surgical procedures) that results in any of the consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event or that might led to any of these consequences if suitable action is not taken or intervention is not made or if circumstances are less opportune. adverse event and adverse device effect reporting procedures if the investigator identifies the occurrence of an ae, sae or of an ade report form must be completed and sent by fax to the coordinating investigator within 24 hours of the investigators knowledge of the event. this form will be part of the study documentation. any fatal or life_threatening event should be reported immediately to coordinating investigator by telephone. these preliminary reports will be followed within 24 hours by detailed descriptions that will include a completed sae/ade form, copies of hospital case reports, autopsy reports, and other documents, when requested and applicable. minimal information should include: an identifiable subject or patient the type of surgical treatment the patient was undergone an identifiable reporting source all related adverse events all medications used follow_up of sae/ades that occur during the study will continue until satisfactory resolution or stabilization, with a maximum of s x months, upon judgment of the investigator. the coordinating investigator may request that certain adverse events to be followed until resolution. if/ when supplementary information is available, a follow_up sae/ade report form must be completed by the investigator and delivered within 24 hours to the coordinating investigator. once faxed, the sae/ade form and accompanying documentation should be placed in the sae/ade section of the investigators file. if supplementary information on a sae/ade has to be sent, the sae/ade form has to be used marked as follow_up report. the coordinating investigator must inform the ethics committee if the serious adverse event is likely to affect the safety of the subjects or the conduct of the study. moreover will be responsibility of the coordinating investigator of informing in writing all clinical investigators about all serious adverse events and all serious adverse device effects occurring during the study. this information shall be sent to the clinical investigators based on perceived risk. direct access to original documentation the investigator will have to allow the national regulatory authority, and the staff designed by the independent ethical committee or by coordinating investigator direct access to the complete original documentation _ and its verification _ including informed consent, signed by the enrolled patients or by their legal representatives, and the clinical records or outpatient registers. people who have direct access to this documentation will have to take all reasonable precautions in order to maintain the patient identity and all information which is property of the coordinating investigator, in compliance with applicable laws. quality assurance procedures the organization, monitoring and quality assurance of the present study will be under the responsibility of the coordinating investigator. clinical monitoring the clinical monitoring will be carried out by qualified persons assigned by the coordinating investigator and will be conducted according to the guidelines of the iso standard 14155_1. additionally the monitoring activities will include the verification of the correct filling of the crfs and, when applicable, the consistence between source documents and the electronic stored data used for the randomization procedures. the coordinating investigator will ensure the practical training for the personal involved in the study on the surgical and medical techniques and on filling the crfs. data review and audits data review and audits will be carried out by qualified persons assigned by the coordinating investigator. the crfs will be periodically reviewed. financing of the study no financial aspect must be taken into account because no funding is foreseen for the present study. table 1 variables recorded during the physical examination and included in dexa physical examination appearence general

487,nct,treatment of low metabolic rate following bariatric surgery,2012,,cn-01503403,"research objectives: the primary objective is to apply an effective medical weight loss treatment to post bariatric surgery patients to enhance their weight loss through stimulation of thermogenesis and lipolysis and retention of lean body mass. this treatment using ephedrine with phosphodiesterase inhibitor (caffeine or theophylline) has been extensively documented as safe and effective in the medical weight loss setting but has not been applied to post_bariatric surgery patients in a placebo controlled, double blind, randomized study. from preliminary studies this treatment should be effective, especially in the treatment of post_surgical patients who continue to have difficulty losing weight despite good activity levels and significant calorie restriction. clinical relevance: raum and others have been treating patients presenting with low metabolic rates during medical and bariatric surgery induced weight loss for many years with ephedrine in combination with caffeine and/or theophylline. all the literature outlined below for the last 40 years have been conducted only during medical weight loss. there are no randomized trials in surgical patients. abstracts and expert opinion papers have been published but without randomization or blinding. ephedrine has become controversial despite considerable evidence of its safe and effective treatment of airway resistance (asthma) for 50 years, and its use for medical weight loss (to stimulate ree and prevent loss of lean body mass) since 1974. an association with a non_regulated food additive, ephedra sparked the initial problems with inappropriate dosing, lack of physician supervision for patient selection and sensationalism in the lay press unsupported by peer_reviewed studies to contradict previous favorable studies. secondly, using ephedrine and pseudoephedrine as substrate for the illegal manufacture of methamphetamine, caused an aura of further unreasoned apprehension. because ephedrine with caffeine or theophylline is one of the few drug combinations that can potentially reverse a low ree and allow a successful weight loss following bariatric surgery, a randomized, controlled study is needed to determine if this effect is statistically and clinically significant in patients having bariatric surgery. the effect of ephedrine on body composition has been studied. two groups were given a very low calorie diet. placebo or ephedrine in combinations with or without methylxanthines and/or aspirin (110 mg tid) in an 8 week trial demonstrated no side effects. the ephedrine groups lost 4.5 kg more fat and 2.5 kg less lean than the placebo, significant differences. ree fell 13 in the placebo group, but only 8 in the ephedrine groups (18). a few examples of the literature were highlighted above that reflect similar studies that can be found in extensive reviews of ephedrine on weight loss (19_26), energy balance and thermogenesis (27,28). the difference between these two contrasting sets of data demonstrates that the unregulated use of ephedrine_containing compounds in unknown and potentially lethal doses in susceptible populations is not to be encouraged. but in preparations where dosage is known and controlled, given in appropriately selected populations, ephedrine with caffeine is safe and effective. references available on request. power analysis was performed with results from our previous studies in non_randomized subjects treated for 2 months. specific aims background and current research following bariatric surgery, metabolic rate decreases secondary to a decrease in sympathetic activity and lean body mass preventing optimal weight loss (1_3). patients reaching this plateau during weight loss be it medical or surgical is well recognized. the plateau is reached when there is no longer a significant difference between calories burned and calories consumed. the equation can be modified at either end. high calorie intake is, by far, the most common reason given for lack of weight loss. the advice provided is to decrease calorie intake. however, there is large subgroup of individuals whose metabolic rate (measured as resting energy expenditure _ ree or resting metabolic rate _ rmr) decreases while caloric intake has remained low. raum (3) has routinely measured ree in bariatric surgery patients for 10 years. a low ree is commonly associated with a reduced weight loss rate. hundreds of patients have been found to have rees significantly depressed from normal (90_s100) to a range of 45 to 80 and a mean of 65. these patients have a deficit of 500 to more than 1000 kcal per day that they would be burning with a normal ree. some patients must consume less than 700 to 1000 kcal/day just to maintain their weight. the methods to increase ree, sympathetic activity, brown adipose tissue activity include exercise, and several drugs including catechins (green tea), caffeine or theophylline with ephedrine, and capsaicin (1). many clinical trials have demonstrated the effect of ephedrine on weight loss (4_7). a significant effect of ephedrine on increasing metabolism is thought to be one of the mechanisms for weight loss. stimulation of brown adipose tissue was thought to contribute to 15 of the increase in thermogenesis and the remainder due to thermogenesis in muscle (8). combinations of ephedrine with methylxanthines (caffeine and/or theophylline) are noted to be even more effective in raising metabolic rates. these effects were most notable in post_obese patients who had some lost some weight, and had depressed metabolic rates. ree increased 8 in the post_obese but had no effect in lean subjects. in the previously obese subjects, the ephedrine_methylxanthine combination normalized the defective thermogenic response to a meal (9). in a 24_week trial with 20 mg of ephedrine and 200 mg of caffeine tid were randomized with placebo. the ephedrine/caffeine group lost 17.5 of body weight with 25 of the weight loss attributed to thermogenesis (10). the thermogenic effect of ephedrine may be lost early in treatment but is restored with the addition of aminophylline (11). experimental study design patients who have been medically cleared for gastric bypass surgery and meet the inclusion criteria or are not eliminated by the exclusion criteria will be offered the opportunity to enroll in the study. patients will be enrolled in the study, irb consents obtained, and randomized to treatment or control groups prior to surgery. patients will follow all usual preoperative and postoperative surgical and medical investigations and care. this includes a baseline resting energy expenditure (ree) and body composition measurement (bc) before surgery. study visits will usually occur at the same times as normal follow up visits and vital signs and weights obtained. considerable recent controversy about the safety of ephedrine has come to pass due to the widespread use of an herbal food additive, ephedra, being marketed widely beginning in the late 1990s. ephedrine had been used without controversy from the 1960s until this time. many anecdotal reports were circulated, including over 18,000 case reports. these and 550 trials were reviewed in a meta_analysis (30). of these reports less than 10 of the trials could be scientifically assessed and of these only 22 consisted of a placebo with some combination of ephedrine, ephedra, caffeine or other herbs. these remaining studies demonstrated a 2.2 to 3.6 fold increase in one or more of the following grouped subjective complaints, psychological, gastrointestinal, autonomic symptoms, and/or palpitations. presumably the other 90 of actual trials did not test or did not highlight these symptoms. other papers (31_33) which were reviews of various types of reports (not designed studies) described instances of acute intoxication resulting in strokes, heart attacks, seizure and even death. because of the uncontrolled nature of the data in the reports, doses, combinations with other drugs, and frequency or duration of exposure were unknown, they could only state whether the associations with ephedra were possible or probable. other researc observed no significant adverse effects or only temporary minor effects with ephedra, ephedrine and caffeine (13, 14, 34_37). these studies were double_blind placebo controlled in selected populations. multiple clinical weight loss trials have measured the chronic and acute effects of combinations of ephedrine (30, 60 and 150 mg per day) with caffeine (300 to 600 mg per day) up to 180 subjects over 24 weeks (10, 12_15). acutely, mean arterial pressure is increased by 9 mm/hg and pulse by 7 beats per minute. by 8 weeks the side effects of tremor, insomnia, dizziness and blood pressure initially noted with ephedrine were equal to placebo. in some studies side effects were only seen at the highest dose of 50 mg tid (16). no adverse effects were noted with a dose of ephedrine 25 mg and caffeine 200 mg tid for 10 days on cardiovascular function as measured by thoracic bio_impedance, automatic sphygmomanometry, continuous electrocardiographic recording or ergometric exercise (17). body composition will be measured by body impedance analysis with a quantum iii bia from rjl systems (michigan). this is a high quality, reproducible system using electrode placement on hands and feet. while dexa body scans may provide more detailed information the research cost for these measurements in this study would exceed the cost of the medications alone. the investigators have three rjl systems in the clinic and the total body lean mass compares well the comparable measurements obtained with the dexa. ree is measured using a sensor medics indirect calorimeter with o2 and co2 measurements to calculate ree. this equipment is located and managed by the respiratory therapy department at good samaritan hospital and has been calibrated, tested and used in other funded research studies. the test is done fasting, without morning medications with minimal pretest activity (15 minutes at rest prior to starting the test), and normal fluid balance. the equipment is calibrated before each test. patients will begin taking ephedrine/caffeine or placebo capsules at 5 weeks after surgery in a gradual tapering dose upward beginning with one capsule daily and increasing each week by one capsule until taking three capsules per day. for the treatment group this would be 75 mg of ephedrine and 600 mg of caffeine per day. at 8 weeks after surgery they will return for an office visit, vital signs taken, bc done, symptom checklist completed and reviewed, and if not experiencing any significant side effects they will be given a 6 weeks supply of capsules. at 14 weeks after surgery they have and office visit with vital signs taken, symptom checklist completed and reviewed and be given another 6 week supply of capsules. at 20 weeks after surgery they have and office visit with vital signs taken, symptom checklist completed and reviewed, and an ree study will be obtained at good samaritan hospital and body composition by bioimpedance in the clinic and be given another 6 week supply of capsules. at 26 weeks after surgery they have and office visit with vital signs taken, symptom checklist completed and reviewed and be given another 6 week supply of capsules. at 32 weeks after surgery they will return for an office visit for vital signs, a symptom checklist and an ree study will be obtained at good samaritan hospital and body composition by bioimpedance in the clinic. they will be given a taper pack of capsules that will be accomplished over 3 weeks. at the clinic visits noted above vital signs, and body weight will be obtained. patients will be questioned about any side effects. they will also be encouraged to call between visits if they have persistent side effects, and will be given a symptom checklist to compare over the phone. as usual routine medical and surgical care will be provided at these visits. adjustments in medications for blood pressure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, nutritional deficiencies and so forth will be addressed and treated as usual. any surgical interventions for wound problems, hernias, or other complications will be attended to and routine lood tests or any other diagnostic tests needed, will be done. if blood pressure cannot be controlled to 140/80, or pulse 100, or patient experiences excessive adrenergic side effects, the treatment will be stopped, but the patient will continue with usual follow up medical and surgical care. the investigators will continue to collect measurements on patients who are unable to tolerate the treatment until the end of the study. patients may withdraw, however, at anytime without any repercussions and will continue to receive regular care. body weights are obtained on an electronic scale, capacity 800 pounds, with shoes off and patients are advised to wear the same light weight clothes at each visit. the scales calibration is checked quarterly (a requirement of current and prior research studies). the investigators use a welch_allyn automatic cuff for blood pressure and pulse. two measurements are obtained in each arm at each visit. the investigators have multiple size cuffs to match upper arm diameter. calibration checked quarterly as research protocols have required.",484,1.0

489,nct,effects of preoperative respiratory physical therapy on postoperative respiratory function after bariatric surgery,2013,,cn-01541523,"background. morbidly obese patients show an increased risk of hypoxemia during the postoperative period resulting in a higher incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications and prolonged hospital length of stay when compared with normal weight subjects. mechanisms involved in this predisposition of morbidly obese patients for develop this physiopathologic scheme include a greater impairment on the respiratory mechanics induced by general anesthesia and paralysis _greater reduction in pulmonary and chest compliances and higher airway resistance_ and an increment in ventilatory requirements. that leads to an increased work of breathing (wob) and oxygen consumption (vo2). these effects are exaggerated in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery because the direct effects of the pneumoperitoneum on the pulmonary mechanics. in addition, in morbidly obese patients respiratory muscles show a reduction in both strength and endurance probably a cause of the fatty tissular infiltration and the exacerbated inflammatory response usually observed in these patients. respiratory physical therapy has shown to be effective and reduce postoperative pulmonary complications both, as postoperative treatment and when given preoperatively. when applied postoperatively respiratory physiotherapy has proved to be able to expand pulmonary volumes and to improve arterial oxygenation, leading to decreases in postoperative pulmonary complications, specially after abdominal surgery. in the specific setting of morbidly obese patients submitted to bariatric surgery, postoperative inspiratory muscle training (imt ) improves inspiratory muscle strength and endurance allowing an earlier recovery of pulmonary airflows. there are scanty data about the results of applying respiratory physiotherapy on the preoperative period. however it has proved to be able to reduce the postoperative incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications in some different settings: (1) in patients after thoracic surgery, (2) in patients undergoing cabg surgery, specially in those considered at high risk for pulmonary complications and (3) after upper abdominal surgery. at our knowledge no studies aimed to determine wether preoperative respiratory physiotherapy could improve the postoperative respiratory function in morbidly obese patients have been published. the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a preoperative respiratory physical therapy program on the postoperative respiratory function in morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric laparoscopic surgery. fifty morbid obese patients (bmi40) consecutively scheduled for laparoscopic bariatric surgery were considered eligible. all subjects were treated by the same surgical team and were submitted to the same anesthetic procedures. all the patients were informed about the objectives and interventions of the study and signed an informed consent form. the protocol was approved by the local human research ethics committee. tracheal extubation was performed in the rtdl position (30o). fully monitored patients were then transferred to the pacu in a semi_sitting position, while receiving a high flow of oxygen in air at a fio2 of 0.5. postoperative analgesia in the first 12 h was intravenous paracetamol (1 g every 6 h) and intravenous dexketoprofen (50 mg every 8 h) for all patients. all the functional data were obtained by the same investigator, namely, the physical therapist. the sample size was calculated using the repeated measures of the pao2/fio2 ratio in the postoperative period as the primary endpoint. assuming that an increment of 25 or more in this parameter (effect size of 0.25) would be of clinical importance, with an alfa error probability of 0.05 and a power of 0.95, a required sample size of 44 patients was obtained. to account for attrition a proportion of 15 was added, reaching a total sample size of 50 patients. the calculation was carried out by means of the gpower 3.1.5 application for statistics. after inclusion, the informed consent procedure, and evaluation of baseline c aracteristics, the study patients were randomly and blindly divided into two groups: control group (cg) and intervention group (rpt). randomization was done with a computer generated randomization table and individual closed sealed envelopes. an investigator blinded to the allocation sequence picked consecutive allocation envelopes for consecutive participants. surgery was scheduled on the day 32 to 36 from the baseline day for all patients. anesthetic management was standardized. patients received no premedication. in the operating room patients were placed in reverse trendelemburg (rtdl) position (30o). continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) at 10 cmh2o was applied to all patients during the administration of oxygen in air (fio2 0.8) for 5 minutes. after preoxygenation anesthesia was induced with propofol, 3 mg.kg_1 based on ideal body weight (ibw x 0.91 height (cm) _ 152,4_1 x 50 for men x 45 for women) and fentanyl 0,1 microg.kg_1, followed by rocuronium 0.6 mg. kg_1. then all the patients were ventilated using pressure support ventilation (psv) with a inspiratory pressure of 10 cmh2o, peep 10 cmh2o and a minimum respiratory rate of 10 breaths.min_1 (ventilator engstrom cs, ge healthcare, finland). when neuromuscular blockade was complete tracheal intubation was performed maintaining the rtdl position at 30o. the radial artery was cannulated for continuous monitoring of arterial blood pressure and arterial blood gas measurements. anesthesia was maintained by continuous infusion of propofol and remifentanil to target a bispectral index (xp version 3.0, aspect medical inc. norwood, ma) between 40 and 50. neuromuscular blockade was maintained with rocuronium and continuously monitored (tof watch, bluestar enterprises, inc., chanhassen, mn). remifentanil was discontinued at the time of the removal of the laparoscope. residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed with neostigmine, 0.05 mg/kg iv (ibw). normothermia was maintained intraoperatively using a forced warm air system (bair hugger, arizant healthcare inc., eden prairie, mn, usa). spirometry was performed according to american thoracic society (ats) recommendations, employing the above mentioned spirometer (datospir_600d) previously calibrated . three acceptable curves and two replicable ones were considered, allowing a maximum of eight attempts to each patient. the choices of the best values were done according to ats criteria . the obtained values were expressed as percentage of normal values calculated according to knudson et al. intraoperative mechanical ventilation was the same for both groups of patients. the lungs were ventilated with volume controlled ventilation (vcv) with a mixture of 50 oxygen in air, and a tidal volume of 6 ml.kg_1 (ibw), inspiratory to expiratory ratio 1:2, and peep 10 cmh2o. respiratory rate was adjusted to maintain end_tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure (etco2) between 30 and 35 mmhg. an alveolar recruitment strategy (ars) was applied after the onset of pneumoperitoneum. ars was performed by increasing peep in increments of 5 cmh2o from 0 to 20 cmh2o using pressure controlled ventilation with a driving pressure similar to the airways plateau pressure obtained during vcv. once peep reached 20 cmh2o the driving pressure was augmented to reach 45 cmh2o. after 10 breaths at maximal airways pressure, peep was decreased in steps of 2 cmh2o and static compliance of the respiratory system was measured at each step in order to determine the lungs closing pressure. then a second ars was applied and peep was set at 2 cm h2o higher than the closing pressure. at the end of surgery a new ars was applied, before the extubation. in this case peep after the ars was kept in 10 cmh2o until the extubation. in order to know the training effects we recorded the patient follow_up to the physical therapy program and measured forced vital capacity (fvc), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (fev1), maximal inspiratory pressure (pimax), and maximal expiratory pressure (pemax) (datospir_600d, sibel sa spain) befo e and at the end of the 30 days of training. all the patients were also instructed and trained about these measurements, aiming to avoid any learning effect during the study. the measurements were performed with the patients on a sitting position and wearing a nasal clip. pimax was measured from residual volume and pemax from total lung capacity. five maneuvers were performed for each patient, and the three most acceptable were registered. the highest value obtained was considered for calculations.",486,1.0

492,nct,prevention and treatment of diabetes complications with gastric surgery or intensive medicines,2013,,cn-01478758,"currently 205 million patients in the world suffer with type 2 diabetes and severe and complex obesity. the obesity is defined as a body mass index above 30 kg/m2 with life or limb threatening co_morbidities. the bariatric surgery increase in worldwide, but their effects on the microvascular complications of t2dm have never been the focus of a randomised controlled clinical trial. to address this research question a three arms on randomised controlled clinical trial comparing gastric bypass surgery, sleeve gastrectomy and modern best medical care is required to investigate differences in long term glycaemia and microvascular complications of t2dm. this is a prospective intervention study on patients with t2dm and obesity undergoing gastric bypass surgery, sleeve gastrectomy or non surgical best medical care. patients will have t2dm for more than 2 years and have or be at high risk of developing kidney damage. patients will be recruited from specialist medical and surgical clinics. we expect to screen approximately 300 patients to allow 75 to be randomized. twenty five subjects with kidney damage or high risk of kidney damage secondary to t2dm will undergo gastric bypass surgery. another 25 sleeve gastrectomy and the final 25 will be treated using the american diabetes association protocol. patients with hba1c 9.0 will undergo individualised optimisation of glycaemia as this should improve surgical outcomes. particular attention will be given to the avoidance of hypoglycaemia. patients other risk factors (including hypertension and dyslipidaemia) will be optimised based on the international diabetes federation guidelines. the clinical endpoints that will be assessed are: renal function, peripheral and autonomic nervous system function, the retina, of direct healthcare cost, glycaemic control, blood pressure, lipids, quality of life, postprandial responses, treatment complications.",489,1.0
493,nct,preop cpet testing and exercise training in colorectal patients,2013,,cn-01489628,"the study will be conducted in two parts: part 1. study to examine the ability of cpet to predict outcomes in patients undergoing colorectal surgery: objectives to identify which cpet variables or combination of variables are most useful in the prediction of post_operative complications following colorectal surgery. in addition, to examine whether cpet variables can be used in combination with other scoring systems or blood tests to increase accuracy of prediction. the aim of this investigation is to develop an accurate prediction model from key clinically relevant predictor variables, including cpet variables, blood tests and risk scoring systems. such a model could be used in clinical practice to predict pre_operative outcome and thus help risk stratify patients for post_operative surveillance or management. study population the norfolk and norwich university hospital undertakes approximately 300 procedures for colorectal cancers per year. patients scheduled for cancer surgery will be recruited to the trial. study outline informed consent to participate in the trial will be obtained in the outpatient setting after diagnosis/scheduling of surgery through discussion with the medical team and the colorectal nurse specialists. all patients will follow a standardised peri_operative pathway devised in conjunction with the surgical and anaesthetic team. sample size a sample size of a minimum of 90 patients has been identified, based on comparable studies with other patient groups in the literature. predictor variables supervised pre_operative cpet testing will take place in the exercise laboratory at the university of east anglia before surgery. the test is done by pedalling on a stationary bicycle, the resistance to pedalling will gradually increase, similar to when cycling up a hill. as the subject rides the stationary bike, the amount of oxygen used, and how fast/efficiently their heart beats is calculated. breathing will be measured through a face mask or a mouth piece and the electrical activity of the heart will be measured via sensors placed on the chest. each cpet test takes around 30 minutes to complete. for each participant in this part of the study, only one cpet test will be done prior to surgery at a convenient time. in addition to the standard pre_surgery blood tests that all nhs patients receive, blood will be taken to measure several key serum markers which have been associated with post_operative outcomes in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery (pro_bnp, crp, albumin and il_6). scoring systems will be applied to patient data as additional indicators of peri_operative risk _ these are systems which involve calculating a measure of risk based on other co_existing illnesses the patient may have. data collection patient notes will be reviewed on each postoperative day to identify postoperative complications according to the post_operative morbidity survey system (poms), this is a scoring tool previously used in other studies which assesses different systems of the body to determine morbidity according to defined criteria (pulmonary, infection, renal, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, wound complications, haematological and pain. time taken until pain relief is satisfactory, ability to eat and drink, satisfactory level of mobility/self_care and bowel function will also be recorded. length of hospital stay and time taken until the patient is medically fit for discharge will also be recorded. part 2: feasibility of a randomised prehabilitation programme in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer objectives study population (as above) study outline following baseline cpet testing to assess initial background fitness, patients will be randomised to one of two study arms: to determine the feasibility of implementing a structured, supervised exercise programme for patients awaiting elective colorectal cancer surgery. the results of this study will be used to inform a larger randomised controlled trial to examine the influence of exercise on cpet variables and postope ative outcomes. 1. a supervised aerobic exercise training pathway standard treatment or 2. standard treatment without supervised exercise training to adequately assess key feasibility outcomes, a sample size of 60 patients (30 in each arm of the study) will be used. patients randomised to exercise training will be offered three sessions of supervised aerobic exercise per week over the subsequent 4 weeks before their procedure to be conducted in the exercise lab at the university of east anglia. each session will include a few simple freehand exercises as well as some time on the treadmill or a fixed exercise bike. the sessions will last about an hour each and will be tailored to individual fitness levels. heart rate, clinical signs, blood pressure and perceived exertion will be recorded regularly throughout exercise. this exercise protocol is currently in use in a study of elderly patients with bladder cancer awaiting surgery and is well_tolerated. repeat cpet testing will then take place 4 weeks from the baseline test in the exercise laboratory (on the day prior to surgery) to determine changes (if any) in cpet variables. the patients in the non_exercise arm of the study will not undergo any exercise intervention but will be cpet tested in the exercise laboratory at the same time points as the exercise arm patients. the data from these patients (n30) will be used to contribute to the first part of the study (cpet variables as predictors of outcome). all patients will be cpet tested again at 3 months post_surgery to assess how well they have returned to their baseline function following their operation. patients will be given follow_up questionnaires at this time, and again at 6 months post_surgery to assess health_related quality of life and psychological outcomes. the questionnaires used will be: champs physical activity questionnaire for older adults, the satisfaction with life scale, hospital anxiety and depression scale (hads), fact_f and the fact_c scale to assess disease_specific quality of life. data collection: as before, patient notes will be reviewed and post_operative complications identified. in addition, this study will assess the feasibility of conducting this trial on a larger scale: to identify the number of eligible patients, recruitment rate, willingness of patients to be randomised, willingness of clinicians to participate in the trial, compliance/tolerance of the exercise regimen, and patient satisfaction with the process. in addition, the costs of undergoing cpet testing and supervised exercise training will be estimated. an assessment of key health outcomes will also be undertaken, i.e. changes in cpet variables following exercise training, postoperative complications, length of stay, and health_related quality of life benefits, thus enabling the planning of a larger trial.",490,1.0
494,nct,an rct of bariatric surgery vs a community weight loss programme for the sustained treatment of iih,2014,,cn-02042324,"idiopathic intracranial hypertension (iih) is a condition with an unknown cause or causes. the condition is associated with raised pressure in the brain and can cause disabling daily headaches and loss of sight, which can be permanent. the raised brain pressure squashes the nerves supplying the eye (also known as papilloedema) and this can affect vision. over 90 of patients with iih are overweight and weight loss is the most effective treatment. other treatments for iih have very little current evidence to support their use. weight loss is difficult to maintain. this trial aims to compare two methods of weight loss, bariatric surgery and the most effective dietary programme commonly available, weight watchers, to see which offers the most effective sustainable treatment for iih. bariatric surgery is recommended by the nice clinical guidelines for patients with a body mass index (bmi) of over 40, or over 35 with a co_morbidity. women suffering from iih have a bmi on average around 38 and iih is not recognised as a co_morbidity for bariatric surgery. this trial will recruit 64 women with iih from neurology and ophthalmology clinics in uk nhs trusts. they will be randomised and 32 participants will be allocated to the dietetic intervention arm, and be enrolled in their local weight watchers group. 32 participants will be allocated to the bariatric surgery arm, and will be referred to their local bariatric surgery pathway to receive bariatric surgery. both groups of participants will be allocated to a treatment arm which is proven to bring about weight loss. participants will then be followed up for five years, with the most important measurement being their brain pressure after one year of being in the trial. a further 20 obese women who dont suffer from iih will be recruited to compare the baseline symptoms and biomarkers of those with iih they will take no further part in the study. 5 further healthy individuals will be scanned twice in an mri test group to validate the mri scan sequence to be used in the trial.",491,1.0
495,nct,effect of two diets with different content of protein on weight loss in adults with metabolic syndrome,2014,,cn-02031278,"our study was a randomised clinical trial with a 6_month follow_up in mexican adult men and women (20_65 years) with metabolic syndrome (ms). the individuals were invited to participate from posters and social network advertising. the study was conducted in two mexican clinics (mexico city and cuernavaca) for obesity and metabolic disorders, used by the mexican national institute of public health (insp) as recruitment centers. the sample size was calculated using a formula that compares two means, an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 95. based on these calculations, we established a baseline sample of 118 adults. for the diagnosis of ms, we used the classification from the international diabetes federation (idf), and therefore participants were required to have three or more of the following criteria: a) waist circumference 90 cm in men and 80 cm in women, b) triglycerides 150 mg/dl, c) high density lipoprotein (hdl_cholesterol) 40 mg/dl in men and 50 mg/dl in women, d) blood pressure 130/85 mmhg and e) fasting glucose 100 mg/dl. exclusion criteria included bariatric surgery for weight loss, smoking, use of alcohol or drugs, psychiatric disorders, anti_obesity medication, soy protein intolerance, women not using birth control methods, and not pregnant or lactating, and body weight gain or loss greater than two percent three months prior to the start of the study. to achieve the baseline sample of 118 adults, 150 patients were screened however, 32 were excluded because they did not meet the criteria. during screening, individuals interested in participating received an explanation of the study design and were given sufficient time to consider inclusion in the clinical trial and complete the form for informed consent. on the same day as consent, doctors wrote down medical history nutritionists conducted anthropometry (weight, height, and waist circumference) and nurses measured blood pressure and withdrew venous blood for determination of glucose, triglycerides, and hdl_cholesterol. after the medical evaluation and nutritional status, we provided meal replacements enriched with soy protein that were consumed during the following two days, testing soy protein tolerance. each clinic supervisor enrolled participants, and the study coordinator conducted the randomization sequencing and assigned participants to interventions. after being randomly assigned to one of two groups, the control group received a diet with a lower protein content (0.8gr/kg body weight), and the intervention group received a diet with higher protein content (1.34gr/kg body weight). both diets had equal amount of calories, were equivalent in the type of carbohydrate, and had a caloric restriction of 500 calories less than the resting metabolic rate (rmr) based on the harris_benedicts formula. the overall study design is shown in figure 1. for the intervention group, meal replacements (drinks and bars) were made with soy protein, and indivi_dualized menus, controlling the content of calories, protein, carbohydrates, and fat, had more control over the total amount of protein consumed daily. after randomization (week 0), participants received specific diet instructions. each month, diets contained 15 different options and were sufficient to meet the needs of micronutrients recommended by the us institute of medicine (recommended dietary intake) according to age and sex. in the intervention group, participants consumed two, protein_enriched drinks, contributing to the daily protein intake (1.34g protein/kg body weight) along with conventional foods and two low_fat bars. used as a substitute for food, the protein_enriched drinks were prepared with 250ml of either milk with 1.5 fat or just water. the nutritional contents of the protein_enriched drink with milk contained 145 calories, 9g protein, 3g fat, and 20.5g carbohydrates. for water, the nutritional contents of the protein_enriched drink contained 22 calories, 5g protein, 0.2g fat, and 0g carbohydrates. in the control group, participants ate three meals and two snacks to have a daily intake of 0.8g protein/kg body weight. for both groups, the calorie density of the diet was adjusted for the baseline metabolic rate of each participant with a restriction of 500kcal/day. measurements previously trained on standards for procedure, nutritionists completed monthly documentation of food frequency questionnaires for participants total caloric intake and grams of protein consumed per day. to minimize errors, the nutritionists and participants scrutinized and discussed the food diaries. the nutritionists also conducted anthropometry (weight and waist circumference) at baseline and at three and six months, using internationally recognized techniques.14 the weight and body composition was measured by an analyzer avis 333, and the waist circumference was measured with a tape measure, using the line between the lower costal border and the iliac crest as reference points. at baseline, height was measured with a wall stadiometer (seca model 222) with an accuracy of 0.1cm. body mass index (bmi) was calculated as weight/height 2. nurses measured blood pressure after 10 minutes of rest with a digital sphygmomanometer (omron hem_907), following the recommendations of the american heart association. blood samples were drawn after a 9_ to 12_hour fasting and processed without delay. laboratory testing included results for metabolic syndrome and hdl_cholesterol, insulin, hemoglobin a1c (hba1c), c_reactive protein (crp), direct bilirubin and indirect bilirubin. all measurements were performed at the mexican national institute of public health (insp). a previously validated questionnaire was used to evaluate adherence to study recommendations for diet and exercise (e.g., walking, biking or jogging at least 30 minutes/day, 5 days per week). statistical analysis the results were shown for the baseline as mean standard deviation and for the comparison between baseline to 6 months as absolute changes or percentage of weight loss. we used the analysis of variance (anova) for means and x2 test for percentages to compare the two groups overtime. two strategies were used to analyze the data: 1) all participants who completed the study after six months, and 2) those participants who dropped out of the study between baseline and six months, using the last recorded measure_ment. the analysis of percentage of weight loss between baseline and 6 months we adjusted for adherence to study recommendations. for this analysis, only the participants who adhered to a minimum of 75 of the study design recommendations were considered. statistical calculations were performed using the stata program version 13. ethical and biosecurity this study was approved by the ethics, research, and biosafety committees from the insp. written informed consent was obtained from all participants. all researchers participated in an ethics certification course, human

the surgical procedure using the institutional review board (irb) approved consent form. the medical record will be examined and the use of any analgesic medications in the 24 hours prior to the procedure will be recorded. patients will be taken to the or and anesthetized using standard procedures of the texas childrens hospital (tch) department of anesthesia, including monitoring according to the american society of anesthesiologists guidelines (ekg, pulse oximetry, bp, temperature and end_tidal expired carbon dioxide and inhalation anesthetic gases). if the attending anesthesiologist believes the child is at risk for aspiration of gastric contents, a rapid sequence induction with propofol 3_4 mg/kg and succinylcholine 1mg/kg iv will be performed with cricoid pressure, in keeping with standard practices. in other patients an iv will be started after induction of anesthesia. an age appropriate endotracheal tube or appropriate sized laryngeal mask airway (lma) will be inserted in all patients. anesthesia will be maintained with sevoflurane, nitrous oxide and oxygen, adjusted to keep blood pressure and heart rate within 20 of baseline values, in keeping with standard practices. all patients will receive ketorolac 0.5mg/kg iv. patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into one of two study groups: ultrasound guided supraclavicular block or iv opioids, based on a computer generated random number by using random allocation software for parallel group randomized trials. the assignment will be made only after written informed consent has been obtained. there will be an equal chance a child will be assigned to one of the two groups. patients randomized to the systemic analgesia group will receive 1mcg/kg of fentanyl iv after induction. patients randomized to the supraclavicular block group will receive an ultrasound guided nerve block with 0.2 ml/kg ropivacaine 0.5 (maximum 10 ml), using the technique described by marhofer et al. in order to decrease variance in success rates, the ultrasound guided nerve block will be performed by 1 of the 4 anesthesiology co_investigators, each of whom have successfully performed over 100 ultrasound guided blocks in the past. supraclavicular blocks were performed using the higher frequency of the probe and placing it in a coronal_oblique_plane in the supraclavicular fossa. the brachial plexus will be identified as a cluster of hypoechoic nodules, lateral to the round pulsating hypoechoic subclavian artery and lying on top of the hyperechoic first rib. the cupola of the lung will be identified. if the transverse colli artery is visualized cephalically surrounding the plexus, the probe will be moved toward a better coronal oblique plane, directing the ultrasound beam slightly caudally, in order to keep the artery away from the plexus. the needle will be was carefully introduced using an in_plane (ip) technique from lateral to medial, toward but not into the brachial plexus. the entire needle image will be visualised at all times to ensure it does not enter the vessel, nerve plexus or pleura. the spread of local anesthetic to all targets of the plexus will be observed on the ultrasound image. at the time of their follow up visit to the surgeon, a complete physical examination will be done including a neurological evaluation for any nerve injury. the time taken to place the block will be recorded from the time the ultrasound probe is first placed on the child until completion of local anesthetic injection. the observer collecting postoperative data will not be present when the block is placed, and a band_aid will be placed over the supraclavicular fossa in all patients to maintain blinding of the observer to the group assignment. during the operation patients can receive intraoperative fentanyl, 1 mcg/kg iv at a time, if the attending anesthesiologist believes it is clinically indicated. at the end of the operation, anesthetic gases will be discontinued while the patient breathes 100 oxygen. the trachea will be extubated when the patient responds to commands, and the child will then be taken to the post anesthetic care unit (pacu) in keeping with standard practices . a validated pain scale (verbal rating scale where 0 no pain and 10 worst possible pain ever) will be used throughout to assess the severity of pain in the postoperative period. in keeping with current practice, patients with pain scores4 will be treated with morphine 0.05mg/kg iv at 10 minute intervals until the score is below 4. oral acetaminophen with hydrocodone (lortab elixir 0.15mg/kg hydrocodone) will be administered to children for pain scores between 2_ 3. supplemental oxygen, rescue antiemetic and antipruritic drugs will be administered in keeping with standard practices of tch and the clinical judgment of the attending anesthesiologist. the duration of supplemental oxygen therapy, any medication administered and complications (side effects such as nausea,

498,nct,the laryngeal mask airway in edentulous geriatric patients,2014,,cn-01547450,"after ethical committee approval and written informed consent were obtained, sixty edentulous patients (american society of anesthesiologists physical status (asa) grade i_iii, aged over 65 years) undergoing elective surgery were included into the study. patients with dentures had to remove their dentures before surgery at the ward. the supraglottic airway device was inserted into each patient in a random order. a statistician independent of the clinical investigators generated the randomization sequence using a computerized program. patients were excluded if they had a known or predicted difficult airway, a body mass index 35 kg/m2, or were at risk of aspiration. all cases were conducted by anesthetists who had experience over 5 years of lma insertion. demographic parameters, mallampati classification and the duration of surgery were recorded. patients were routinely monitored using ecg, non_invasive blood pressure measurement, pulse oximetry and end_tidal carbon dioxide tension. depth of anesthesia was monitored with bispectral index (bis). patients were premedicated with midazolam 0.02 mg/kg when venous access was obtained. after 3 min preoxygenation with 100 oxygen via face mask, anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 1_2 ug/kg and propofol 1_2 mg/kg. when the bis value was 40_60 7 the predetermined supraglottic airway device was inserted according to the manufacturers recommendations. the supraglottic airway devices were deflated fully before insertion. size 4 lma was used for those with a weight of 50_70 kg and size 5 lma for those between 70_100 kg. after insertion, each device was inflated with a hand_held airway manometer (rusch, germany) to an intracuff pressure of 60 cm h2o. an effective airway was defined as the presence of normal thoracoabdominal movement and a square_wave end_tidal carbon dioxide trace. general anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, o2 and n2o. insertion time was defined as the time from picking up the airway device until connection to the airway circuit. ease of insertion was graded by the attending anesthesiologist as easy, fair or difficult. if after three attempts insertion was still not successful, the other device was used. if insertion of the other device also failed the patient was endotracheally intubated. before the oropharyngeal leak test was carried out, the face of the patient was covered so that the observer was blinded to the airway device. the oropharyngeal leak pressure was determined by transiently stopping ventilation and closing the adjustable pressure_limiting valve with a fresh gas flow of 3 l/min until airway pressure reached a steady state and a voice of leakage was heard. the airway pressure was not allowed to exceed 40 cm h2o. after successful placement of the lma supreme, a 12 french gauge gastric catheter was inserted via the gastric channel. any episode of hypoxemia (spo2 90), aspiration or regurgitation,bronchospasm and airway obstruction were documented. after removal of the lma, it was examined for the presence of visible blood. in the postanesthesia care unit, a research assistant, who was blinded to the group allocation, interviewed the patients using a predetermined questionnaire to collect data on the postoperative pharyngolaryngeal adverse events. the presence or absence of sore throat, dysphonia and dysphagia was assessed at 1 and 24 h postoperatively.",495,1.0
499,nct,effect on energy metabolism at cellular level of diet plus treatment with ephedrine and caffeine in obesity,2014,,cn-02024163,"this trial was part of a sub_project of a multicentre study named interaction between nutritional, social_behavioral and metabolic factors for prevention of cardiovascular disease: development of nutritional strategies on general population approved by the italian ministry of health. the sub_project was specifically addressed to diet, thermogenesis and obesity. 2_ to 3_fold increase in ucp3 mrna levels in lean and obese humans. 2. because only a few, small studies have been done in humans to investigate the thermogenic effects of ec as compared to diet only, in the present study we examined the ucp3 expression in skeletal muscle and the beta_3 adrenoceptor expression in adipose tissue of pre_menopausal morbidly obese females treated with either placebo or ec for 30 days who subsequently underwent bariatric surgery. 3. study subjects are adult females with morbid obesity i.e. body mass index 40 kg/m2 selected from the waiting list for bariatric surgery at department of surgery (molinette hospital, turin, italy. during the treatment period all patients are fed a hypocaloric diet (total energy content of 70 of energy expenditure, as measured by indirect calorimetry), and containing 20 proteins, 55 carbohydrates, 25 fat half of which was monounsaturated, and 35 g/day fibres. patients are randomised to 30_day treatment with either ec (200/20mg t.i.d.) or placebo. they are hospitalised, during the whole treatment period, at the metabolic unit of san giuseppe hospital_istituto auxologico italiano at piancavallo (vb, italy). the ec administration starts with an initial dose of 100/10 mg t.i.d. for the first week and then proceeds with the full dose of 200/20 mg t.i.d. resting energy expenditure is measured by indirect calorimetry at baseline and at the end of the study. the study pills (active compound and placebo) were prepared by the hospitals pharmacy. 4. in order to evaluate drug safety and effect on cardiac function, the blood pressure is measured three times a day both electrocardiography and echocardiography are being recorded at baseline and every week. after diet and drug period, the patients are transferred to the department of surgery (molinette hospital, turin) for the bariatric surgery. the drug treatment (ec and placebo) is stopped the day before surgical intervention. small biopsies of rectus abdominis and of subcutaneous and omental adipose tissues are taken during surgery, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at _80c for subsequent analysis. 5. ucp3s and ucp3l mrna levels are measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction at the department of pharmacology, university of milan. presence of beta_3 adrenoceptor in adipose tissue is evaluated by immunohistochemistry by the avidin_biotin peroxidase technique using monoclonal anti_human beta 3_adrenoceptor antibody at the department of human anatomy, university of ancona. 1. ephedrine and caffeine (ec) combination has been widely used in human obesity treatment, and is still present in many herbal preparations sold widespread in many countries for weight loss. it is well known that this drug increases the metabolic rate in both animals and humans. ephedrine is an agonist of both _ and __adrenoceptors moreover, it induces norepinephrine release from sympathetic neurons, and thus is a sympatho_mimetic drug with a mixed profile. caffeine increases both norepinephrine and dopamine release and stimulates the neuronal activity in several brain regions. in addition, caffeine antagonizes the inhibitory effects of adenosine on sympathetic nervous system (sns). this modulation of sns activity may be a possible explanation for the thermic effect of ec. in fact, epinephrine activates the uncoupling protein 1 (ucp1), a member of mitochondrial carriers localized on the inner mitochondrial membrane in brown adipocytes. the physiological role of ucp1 is to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation, therefore most of the energy is dissipated as heat rather than being converted to atp. ucp1 is unique to brown adipocyte m tochondria, although brown_like multilocular adipocytes expressing ucp1 interspersed within human wat have been observed. actually, ucp1 mrna has been detected in all adipose tissues in adult humans, and it has been estimated that 1 in 100_200 adipocytes in human intraperitoneal adipose tissue expresses ucp1. it has been shown that the cold_induced occurrence of brown_like adipocytes and ucp1 requires the presence of the _3_adrenoceptor in previously white adipose tissue and the presence of the _3_adrenoceptor is required for full stimulation of energy expenditure and oxygen consumption in white adipose tissue. in addition to ucp1, expressed exclusively in brown adipose tissue (bat), another member of the mitochondrial anion carrier protein family i.e. uncoupling protein 3 (ucp3) could play a physiological role in energy homeostasis. it is expressed almost exclusively in skeletal muscle and exhibits two transcriptional isoforms: a long form (ucp3l) and a short form (ucp3s). a brief caloric restriction resulted in",496,1.0

laparoscopic bariatric surgery, the investigators hypothesize that perioperative administration of low rather than high intravenous infusion rates of lidocaine can achieve early postoperative restoration of bowel motility at lower plasma levels. up to the best of the investigators knowledge there is no study addressed the effects of perioperative administration of systemic lidocaine on postoperative recovery of bowel function in morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric procedures. aim of the study this trial aims to compare the effects of perioperative administration of escalating doses of intravenous lidocaine (1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mg/kg/h) on the perioperative changes in hemodynamic, pain scores, and plasma lidocaine concentrations, postoperative recovery of bowel function, cumulative morphine use, hospital length of stay, and lidocaine related adverse effects in obese patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgeries under general anesthesia. randomization five minutes before induction of general anesthesia, participants will be allocated randomly into four groups by drawing sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes containing a software_generated randomization code to receive an intravenous bolus of 0.1 ml/kg of either saline 0.9 or lidocaine 1.5 solution followed by a continuous infusion 0.1 ml/kg/h of saline 0.9 or lidocaine 1, 1.5 or 2 solution which will be continued for 24 hours after surgery. all medications in the study protocol will be based on the dosing body weight ideal body weight (ibw) 0.4 _ (actual body weight_ibw). all study solutions looked identical and will be prepared by a local pharmacy. all staff in the operating room will be unaware of patient allocation group. perioperative management an independent anesthesiologist who will not be involved in the study will instruct the participants preoperatively about the use of patient controlled analgesia and visual analogue scale to assess the severity of postoperative pain (0 mm for no pain and100 mm for worst imaginable pain). anesthetic management will be standardized. oral ranitidine 150 mg and metoclopramide 10 mg will be administered the night before and 60 min before arrival in the operating room and subcutaneous enoxaparin 60 mg will be administered 12 h before the scheduled operation for prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis. participants monitoring includes electrocardiography, non_invasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry, plethysmography variability index (pvi) and capnography. following pre_oxygenation, in all participants, anesthesia will be induced with fentanyl 2_3 ug/kg and propofol 1.5_2.5 mg/kg. rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg will be administered to facilitate tracheal intubation.

vomiting. before wound closure, bupivacaine 0.25 will be infiltrated at all portals, and residual neuromuscular block will be antagonized with neostigmine, 50 ug/kg iv, and glycopyrrolate, 10 ug/kg iv. after completing surgery, sevoflurane will be discontinued and infusion of study medication will be continued for 24 h after the wound closure. times from discontinuation of sevoflurane to eye opening, obeying simple commands (e.g., open mouth, squeeze hand) and tracheal extubation will be recorded. postoperative analgesic regime will be standardized in all participants including 30 mg of intravenous ketorolac every 6 h and paracetamol 1 g iv every 6 h and rescue doses of intravenous meperidine 25 mg. participants will be discharged from the post_anesthesia care unit when they have a modified aldrete score levels. intravenous fluids will run at 40 ml/h on the night of surgery and will be discontinued 24 h after surgery. little attention is paid to urine output or oliguria in the absence of abnormal vital signs. strict parameters for fluid boluses the night of surgery are in place based on hypotension and tachycardia. active bedside mobilisation will be enforced for the first time the evening after surgery and assisted ambulation the morning after surgery at least twice a day. criteria for hospital discharge are as follows: absence of nausea and vomiting in the last 24 h, return of bowel function (daily defecation) and toleration of full diet, no to minimal pain (vas less than 4), afebrile and no surgically associated morbidity (fever, wound dehiscence, wound infection, anastomotic leak, abscess). these variables will be recorded by a blind assessor to the allocation, every day at 10:00, 14:00 and 18:00 h. patients ready for discharge after 14:00 h will be

502,nct,dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibition and narrow-band ultraviolet-b light in psoriasis (dinup),2015,,cn-02036092,"background: psoriasis is a chronic, autoimmune skin disease affecting approximately 2 of the worlds population. it is characterised by keratinocyte hyperproliferation, by aberrant keratinocyte differentiation and by cutaneous inflammation. dipeptidyl peptidase_4 (dpp_4) is expressed on keratinocytes and its activity is upregulated in psoriasis. dpp_4 inhibition suppresses keratinocyte proliferation and restores partially keratinocyte differentiation. the main site of dpp_4 activity is cluster of differentiation antigen 26 (cd26). cd26 is a marker of t cell activation and is a key molecule in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. one case of dpp_4 inhibitor therapy improving psoriasis severity has been reported. agents used to treat psoriasis target commonly the underlying inflammation. c_reactive protein (crp) is a sensitive, systemic marker of inflammation. in people with type 2 diabetes (t2dm) dpp_4 inhibitor therapy decreases crp concentrations. serum crp concentrations correlate with psoriasis severity and interventions that decrease the crp concentration may decrease also psoriasis severity. medications that improve insulin resistance may decrease also systemic inflammation and improve psoriasis. we have shown previously, in psoriasis patients without t2dm (both lean and obese), that the fasting insulin concentration and the homeostatic model of insulin resistance (measures of insulin resistance) correlate strongly with the psoriasis area and severity index (pasi, a measure of psoriasis severity: r0.48, p0.001 r0.49, p0.001). dpp_4 inhibitors prevent also the degradation of insulin secretagogues, such as glucagon_like peptide_1 (glp_1), thereby ameliorating hyperglycaemia without causing hypoglycaemia. due to this effect dpp_4 inhibitors are effective for the treatment of t2dm. other interventions which increase glp_1 receptor activation, such as roux_en_y gastric bypass surgery and glp_1 analogue therapy, can improve also psoriasis severity. we have reported previously a significant improvement in two patients with psoriasis and diabetes treated with the glp_1 analogue liraglutide. in a subsequent open study of 7 patients with both psoriasis and type 2 diabetes we found a significant reduction in psoriasis severity and a significant improvement in quality of life following treatment with liraglutide. name and description of the investigational medicinal products(s): januvia 100 mg tablets, which are film_coated tablets for oral ingestion that contain 100mg of the dipeptidyl peptidase_4 inhibitor sitagliptin. for research participants with moderate kidney disease (crcl 50 ml/min or egfr 50 ml/min/1.73m2), a dose of 50mg per day of sitagliptin will be used. potential risks and benefits: more than 1 of people who take januvia tablets experience upper respiratory tract infection (no greater incidence than with placebo), hypoglycaemia (no greater incidence than with placebo), headache or limb pain. the potential benefits of dpp_4 inhibition include decreased risk of cardiovascular disease and decreased risk of bone fracture. the anticipated benefits of januvia therapy in psoriasis patients without type 2 diabetes thus justify the potential risks. description of and justification for the route of administration, dosage, dosage regimen and treatment period: study hypothesis: dipeptidyl peptidase_4 inhibitor therapy decreases psoriasis severity. statement of trial conduct: cohort: the population to be studied will be psoriasis patients with type 2 diabetes. identification and recruitment: statistical analysis plan: subgroup analyses will be performed on those research participants who: complete the visit 6 assessment have severe psoriasis have non_severe psoriasis are male are female are obese and are older than 45 years. this will be a two centre, thirty_nine week, prospective, randomized, open_label clinical trial of oral januvia (sitagliptin) tablets in 120 people with psoriasis without diabetes who are due to undergo a course of nb_uv phototherapy. after a three week run_in period, where research participants will not receive the investigational medicinal product, research participants will be allocated randomly, after stratification by centre, by hba1c level (hba1c 38mmol/mol or 38mmol/mol), bmi level (bmi 30 kg/m2 or 30 kg/m2) and previous response to nb_uvb (achieved remission within 25 exposures during most recent course of nbuvb or not) either to arm a or to arm b. those who have not been exposed previously to nbuvb will be placed in the did not achieve remission within 25 exposures group. research participants allocated to arm a will receive a twenty six week supply of januvia tablets (dpp_4 inhibitor) and will be instructed to ingest orally one 100mg tablet once daily (or 50mg once daily for participants with moderate kidney disease) for twenty four weeks. research participants allocated to arm b will receive no treatment (aside from usual medications and phototherapy). both the research participants and the investigators will be aware of the trial arm to which the research participant has been allocated randomly (open_label study). research participants will be prohibited from making any changes to the dose of medications used to treat psoriasis. any other medications that are considered necessary for the participants welfare and will not interfere with the study medication may be given at the discretion of the investigator. januvia is licensed to improve glycaemic control for people with type 2 diabetes (t2dm). the summary of product characteristics (spc) states that the dose of januvia is 100mg once daily (using tablets for oral ingestion). for research participants with moderate kidney disease (crcl 50 ml/min or egfr 50 ml/min/1.73m2), the summary of product characteristics (spc) states that the dose of januvia is 50mg once daily (using tablets for oral ingestion). in keeping with this all participants with an egfr 50ml/min/1.73m2 who are due to receive januvia will receive 50mg once daily. this trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, with the guidelines of the declaration of helsinki (see appendix 2), with the international conference of harmonisation tripartite guideline on good clinical practice, with all applicable regulatory requirements and with data protection legislation (data protection act 1988 and data protection amendment act 2003) we plan to enrol 120 research participants in total. research participants will be recruited from two centres: st vincents university hospital, elm park, dublin 4 and adelaide and meath hospital, tallaght, dublin 24. these hospitals provide outpatient dermatology services. psoriasis patients attending these centres who have a psoriasis area and severity index (pasi) greater than 7 and who are due to undergo a course of nb_uvb phototherapy will be considered potentially eligible research participants and will be invited to attend for a screening visit. potentially eligible research participants will be identified through use of patient databases in st vincents university hospital and in adelaide and meath hospital and through review of healthcare records in st vincents university hospital and in adelaide and meath hospital. packaging and labelling: the following assessments will then be performed: 1. checking against inclusion and exclusion criteria 2. obtaining demographic information 3. obtaining a detailed medical history (previously diagnosed illnesses etc) 4. obtaining a detailed medication history for the previous month potentially eligible research participants will be recruited in one of two ways by the study investigators or suitably qualified designee. one of these two ways will be during a clinic visit by the study investigators or suitably qualified designee. the other of the two ways will be mailing a letter of invitation. a record of all medication taken by study participants in the month before visit 1 and concomitant medication a participant takes throughout the study will be recorded on the appropriate page of the case r port form (crf). treatment compliance of research participants will be measured by pill counts. research participants will be instructed to bring opened, unopened and empty investigational medicinal product packages to each visit in order to allow the assessment of compliance with study treatment. a record of all investigational medicinal product dispensed and returned will be documented on the investigational medicinal product dispensing and accountability log. blood taken during stages when the participant is expected to be taking drug therapy will be used for future determination of plasma glucose and glycated haemoglobin concentrations. these concentrations will also be used to help ascertain compliance with the allocated treatment regimen. blood samples for measurement of laboratory parameters will be taken between the hours of 0800 and 1200 after a greater than 12 hour overnight fast (with the exception of the screening visit when participants can attend in a non fasting state) and before ingestion of the study investigational medicinal product. the blood will be taken by a senior clinician, or suitably qualified designee, with competence and experience in the procedure of venepuncture. thirty millilitres (30ml) of blood will be drawn during visit 1, and 73.5 ml during visit 2. sixty millilitres (60ml) of blood will be drawn from the research participants during visits 3 to 5, and at visit 7. during visits 6 and 8, 67.5 mls of blood will be drawn.blood will be drawn into vacutainer tubes containing either ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta), lithium heparin, sodium fluoride, clot activator or a dpp_4 inhibitor cocktail. each research participant will be asked to give a blood sample for genetic analysis at the 2nd visit. these genetic samples will be analysed to try determine the genetic, and/or epigenetic, profile that predicts best response to dpp_4 inhibitor therapy. whole blood will be stored for future dna extraction using the protocols detailed in the molecular medicine ireland guideline for standardised biobanking (first edition 2010). this involves drawing blood into a blood tube containing edta and storing the blood tube at _20c in secure, dedicated freezers in the research laboratories in the education and research centre in st vincents university hospital. the blood will be stored within 12 hours of blood collection. blood that has been stored for future dna extraction will be destroyed once the dna analyses are complete. disposal of this material will be in accordance with current practice in this unit and with the written protocols in place in this unit. disposal will involve the use of solid plastic waste containers which will be sent for incineration. 5. measurement of weight, blood pressure and heart rate 6. performing a urine based pregnancy test (women of child bearing potential only) 7. assessment of pasi and 8. blood sampling for laboratory examination. baseline (visit 2, day 0) the potential research participant will return for the baseline visit within three weeks of the screening visit. the following assessments will be performed: 2. recording of adverse events 3. recording of changes in concomitant medication 4. measurement of height, weight, blood pressure and heart rate to protect the research participants identity, a unique identification code will be assigned by the investigator, or authorised designee, to each participants genetic sample and used in lieu of the participants name. this coded form of identification, instead of the participants name, will appear on all documents/databases. demographic and baseline clinical data will be summarized using descriptive statistics by treatment group. similarly, the primary and secondary efficacy variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics by treatment group. data from research participants who are not allocated to either arm of the study and who do not receive a supply of the investigational medicinal product will be excluded from statistical analyses. t tests (or the appropriate alternative for non_parametri data), using two_sided tests, will be used to test for significant differences between the sets of data obtained. the independent samples t test will be used to assess for differences between the effects of the test product (januvia) compared to the effects of no additional treatment. chi square analyses will be used to test for significant differences in categorical variables between the sets of data obtained. all study medication will be labelled and stored in accordance with annex 13 of the eu guidelines of good manufacturing practice in respect of investigational medicinal products for human use, the spc and hospital procedures. screening visit (visit 1, week _3) before any screening examinations take place potentially eligible research participants will be given a full explanation as to what participation in the study would involve _ this will be done both verbally and in writing in the form of a written participant information leaflet. potential research participants will be given sufficient time to consider their participation in the study and to ask any questions concerning the study. potential research participants who are willing to take part in the study will be asked then to sign an informed consent form. no study related procedures will take place for any research participant before the informed consent form has been signed. an identification number will be allocated to the potential research participant following informed consent and provided that he or she meets the inclusion criteria and does not have an exclusion criterion to study entry. this identification number, together with the participants initials, will act as a unique identifier for that participant. 1. completion of quality

applicable). once participants have completed their involvement in this study they will be provided with standard treatment by their usual healthcare providers. adverse events: comprehensive assessments of any apparent toxicity experienced by the research participant will be performed throughout the course of the study from the time of participants signature of informed consent. adverse events (aes) considered related to study drug at the end of study visit (or early withdrawal visit, if applicable) will be followed until the participant is stable or the ae is resolved or the participant is lost to follow_up. any medical c ndition, or clinically significant laboratory abnormality with an onset date before the baseline visit and not related to a protocol_associated procedure, is not an ae. it will be considered to be pre_existing. complete and appropriate data on all adverse events experienced (observed, volunteered or elicited) during the reporting period will be reported on an ongoing basis in the adverse event form pages of the case report form. the investigator will classify the severity of an adverse event. the investigator will systematically assess the relationship of the adverse event to the investigational medicinal product. reporting of serious adverse events (saes) information about all saes will be collected and recorded on the sae report form. each sae must be reported by the investigator, or an authorised designee, to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. medical and scientific judgement will be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life_threatening or result in death or hospitalisation, but may jeopardise the research participant or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. these will be considered also serious. justification of population and method of estimation: we plan to enrol 120 research participants in total in the two sites. the primary objective of the research project is to determine the change in the psoriasis area and severity index (_pasi) during twenty four weeks of treatment with a dipeptidyl peptidase_4 inhibitor (januvia, 100mg daily or 50mg daily for participants with moderate kidney disease) in psoriasis patients undergoing narrow_band ultraviolet_b (nb_uvb) light therapy. this will be compared to the _pasi of psoriasis patients undergoing nb_uvb light therapy who are allocated randomly to not receive any additional treatment. method of randomisation: januvia tablets or no additional treatment. in order to achieve this we have prepared 8 randomisation lists using a web_based random generator programme. one copy of this document will be used for each centre. kleinpenning et al have determined previously the effect of two different nb_uvb light therapy regimens on the decrease in pasi three months after completion of a course of nb_uvb light therapy. three months after cessation of nb_uvb light therapy the decrease in the pasi in those receiving an high_dose regimen was 5.934.1compared to baseline. this decrease in pasi was significantly less in the group receiving a low_dose regimen (4.142.96, p0.05). based on these data, and assuming a 33 dropout rate, we have calculated that we will require 60 research participants (in each arm) to detect a greater than 33 difference in the _pasi with 80 power and a 5 significance level. the unit of randomisation will be the individual research participant. after stratification by centre, by hba1c level (hba1c 38mmol/mol or 38mmol/mol), bmi level (bmi 30 kg/m2 or 30 kg/m2) and previous response to nb_uvb (achieved remission within 25 exposures during most recent course of nbuvb or not) 120 research participants will be assigned randomly, in a ratio of 1:1 using blocks of 2, to receive either: for each participant the investigator, or authorised designee, will chose the appropriate list and will add the participants identifier to the list in chronological order. this list will be thereby used to determine the study treatment which the participant will receive. random allocation will occur at visit 2 (baseline visit) once all screening procedures required at visit 1 (screening visit) have been completed, once it has been confirmed that the participant satisfies all inclusion and exclusion criteria and once the participant completes the three week run_in period. identification numbers will be assigned chronologically in consecutive, ascending order. independent ethics committee (iec)/institutional review board (irb) approval: before in tiating this study the study protocol, summary of product characteristics (spc), patient information leaflet and informed consent form, applicable advertising, and any other written information to be given to participants will be reviewed and approved by a properly constituted institutional review board/independent ethics committee (iec/irb). a signed and dated statement that all documents submitted for review have been approved by the iec/irb will be given to the sponsor or designee before the study can commence at a site. the membership and the constitution of the iec/irb who approved the documents will be also supplied to the sponsor or designee. ethical conduct of the study: this study will be carried out in compliance with the study protocol and in accordance with the sponsor/contract research organisations (cros) standard operating procedures (sops). these are designed to ensure adherence to good clinical practice (gcp) guidelines, as described in: international conference on harmonization of technical requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use (ich) harmonized tripartite guidelines for good clinical practice 1996. european union (eu) ct directive 2001/20/ec. gcp commission directive 2005/28/ec.

503,nct,endobarrier tm gastrointestinal liner diabetes trial,2015,,cn-01590273,"the management of obesity is challenging and obesity surgery is by far the most effective treatment currently available. recent medical research indicates that it also improves the management of blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes. obesity surgery carries different risks and benefits and it is important to balance these by choosing the right procedure for each patient. therefore new effective strategies to prevent and reduce obesity and its complications such as type 2 diabetes mellitus are needed. this study is designed to see whether a new device called the endobarrier gastrointestinal liner helps patients manage their blood sugar levels and lose weight. it is a randomised, placebo controlled trial which compares the potential of the endobarrier device with conventional drug therapy, diet and exercise for obesity related type 2 diabetes, and their effectiveness on metabolic state (hba1c reduced by 20 and blood pressure below 135/85), weight loss, and quality of life. it will further evaluate whether any other conditions that may be related to obesity could become less severe and collect information about complications to determine the safety of the device. the study will also perform various measurements and tests to understand the underlying mechanism of the device. after an initial screening visit to determine patients eligibility, they will be invited for 14 subsequent visits. patients will be randomised into either having the endobarrier device or standard medical therapy treatment for 12 months followed by another 12 months follow_up period. they will also be routinely seen by specialist dietitian who will provide dietetic support throughout the study.",500,1.0
504,nct,celiac plexus block for chronic pancreatitis rct,2015,,cn-01505284,"1.0 background and hypothesis: chronic pancreatitis is an inflammatory disease of the pancreas characterized by painful scarring and loss of glandular function.the prevalence of chronic pancreatitis in the united states is estimated to be 0.2 to 5 and results in 86,000 hospitalizations. the majority of patients with chronic pancreatitis will develop significant abdominal pain which is debilitating and results in a significant burden on the health care system. multiple approaches, including pancreatic enzymes, narcotic analgesia, celiac plexus block and surgical ganglionectomy have been used to treat pancreatic pain with variable success. injection of local anesthesia agents and steroids into the celiac plexus for pain control has been used for many years via both surgical and percutaneous approaches. topical therapy theoretically prevents the conduction of painful stimuli from the pancreas and addresses inflammatory changes in the afferent nerves themselves. splanchnic nerves pass from the pancreas to the thoracic root ganglia via the celiac ganglia which are the target for intervention. nerve changes in chronic pancreatitis including perineural inflammation, altered diameter, and upregulation of pain neuropeptides (including substance p) are associated with increased sensitivity to stimuli from the pancreas (distension and inflammation) as well as pain independent of stimuli (neuropathic). endoscopic ultrasound allows for close proximity, high resolution assessment of the gastrointestinal tract wall and adjacent anatomic structures. physicians are able to perform eus_guided celiac plexus injections in the outpatient setting under conscious sedation. the eus guided approach offers better visualization of the celiac region and direct access to the celiac plexus. eus guided celiac plexus block is a core part of the routine care of patients at los angeles county hospital with chronic pancreatitis. celiac plexus block is a recommendation for refractory chronic pancreatitis pain by the european society of gastrointestinal endoscopy (esge). these modest improvement for celiac block for chronic pancreatitis (especially in comparison to celiac plexus neurolysis in pancreas cancer) have led some investigators to question whether eus guided celiac plexus block is an effective treatment for chronic pancreatitis pain despite its routine use. prospective randomized controlled studies examining the efficacy of endoscopic ultrasound guided celiac plexus block are lacking. 2.0 objectives and purpose our aim is to perform a pilot randomized trial to gauge the degree to which celiac plexus block performed under endoscopic ultrasound guidance will benefit patients with chronic pancreatitis. we will assess whether celiac plexus block significantly decreases pain scores, hospitalization, and pain medication requirements and increases the ability to return to normal activities. 3.0 study design patients presenting to the los angeles county medical center and gastroenterology clinic with chronic upper abdominal pain are the focus population of this study. patients who are undergoing endoscopic ultrasound for standard clinical care to assess for chronic pancreatitis will be enrolled. they must have a m_annheim severity score of 6 or greater. additionally, they must have at least intermittent if not chronic pain of intensity 3 on the visual analogue scale requiring opiate medication. 4.1 side effects/toxicities to be monitored: 4.12 long term toxicities to be monitored after completion of the celiac block during the 6 months the patients are followed. 4.2 dosage changed based on toxicity there will be no dosage adjustments as the procedure will be performed once during the study period. 4.32 places for submitting reports: adverse events will be reported to the irb and data safety monitoring committee. several studies have shown that eus_guided cpb has a beneficial role in treating pain caused by chronic pancreatitis. a randomized trial by gress et al looked at the efficacy of eus_guided versus ct_guided celiac plexus block for controlling abdominal pain of chronic pancreatitis in 18 patients. they found significant improvement in pain symptoms in patients randomized to eus_guided celiac plexus block over a mean time period of 10 weeks. a study by the same group showed an improvement in overall pain score in 55 at 4 and 8 weeks of follow_up in 90 patients. adverse events including diarrhea and infection occurred in 3. a comprehensive review by kaufman et al in 2010 evaluated the efficacy of eus_guided celiac plexus block and celiac plexus neurolysis in alleviating chronic abdominal pain due to chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer respectively. a total of 6 studies were included in their analysis, comprising 221 patients, and found that eus_guided celiac plexus block was effective in 51.46 of patients with chronic pancreatitis. eus_guided celiac plexus neurolysis (with alcohol) was effective in 72.54 of those with pancreas cancer. the procedures will be performed by experienced endosonographers. the eus_guided celiac plexus block will be performed under the guidance of linear array endosonography. a visual exam will first be performed with the eus scope or a standard endoscope. patients found to have a significant peptic ulcer or other mucosal abnormality will be excluded as the symptoms may be secondary to peptic disease. an eus exam will then be performed to determine whether the patient has findings of chronic pancreatitis. the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis will be confirmed based on eus criteria (meeting four or more criteria of hyperechoic foci, hyperechoic strands, lobularity, cysts, stones, dilation of the main pancreatic duct, irregular pancreatic_duct margins, presence of side branches and hyperechoic pancreatic duct_margins). those who are confirmed to have chronic pancreatitis will be randomized (1:1) during the procedure to celiac plexus block versus no injection treatment. randomization will be performed using a computer program with concealed allocation. the research coordinator obtaining data for follow up visits and the patient will be blinded to randomization. the endosonographer will not be blinded. ninety patients will be enrolled (see statistical considerations for sample size calculation). those randomized to control will undergo eus and confirmation of chronic pancreatitis but not celiac plexus block. patients in the treatment group will receive celiac plexus block with 10ml 0.25 bupivacaine and 2ml (40mg/cc) triamcinolone which are the standard doses. the 22 gauge needle will be inserted into the base of the celiac plexus via the transgastric approach and a single injection will be performed. an intravenous antibiotic will be administered at the time of the block to those in the celiac plexus block group with the specific agent depending on the patients allergy profile. the research coordinator obtaining data for follow up visits and the patient will be blinded to the details of the block (or lack thereof) procedure but it will be recorded. following the procedure standard recovery room monitoring including assessment of blood pressure be performed for 2 hours for both groups. periprocedural fluid and antibiotic use for celiac plexus block is not standardized and will be at the discretion of the endoscopist performing the cases. patients will be assessed before the procedure, immediately afterward, and at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months following the procedure. at the initial assessment and follow up visits visual analogue pain scores will be recorded as well as an assessment of the ability to work and conduct activities of daily living. pain medication requirements and whether symptoms are alleviated by analgesic or disrupt sleep will be noted. the m_annheim scoring system will be used to gauge symptoms as well. additionally, patients will complete a focused version of the online careprep program during each visit. the online careprep (oca) program is used to clinically evaluate patients with complex symptoms or conditions generally characterized significant physical symptoms, ps chosocial issues, impaired quality_of_life and functional status, disability, and substance abuse. it has an online format that has been successfully used by outpatient with various gastrointestinal illness to report multifactorial symptoms. when performed prior to appointments it appears to facilitate efficient and productive medical visits. 4.11 three most common complications from celiac plexus block include hypotension, transient diarrhea, transient increase in pain. extraordinarily rare/theoretical complications include paralysis, pneumothorax, loss of sphincter function, retroperitoneal bleeding, renal puncture and prolonged gastroparesis. 4.3 adverse event reporting: 4.31 type of event to be reported and timing of reports. if patients develop adverse events including hypotension, transient diarrhea, transient increase in pain, or less common complications of unilateral paresis or paraplegia, pneumothorax, loss of sphincter function, retroperitoneal bleeding, renal puncture, prolonged gastroparesis or infection, this will be reported to the principal investigators and will be reviewed by the study team as well as two staff physicians in the gastroenterology division who are not part of the study team. this will also be reported to the irb. if patients experience any further events that are detected during follow up these will be coded as a) related to study or b) not related to study. their severity and a) whether they were expected or b) not expected will also be recorded. these complications will also be reported to the principal investigators and will be reviewed by the study team as well as two staff physicians in the gastroenterology division who are not party of the study team. they will also be reported to the irb. 4.4 data monitoring committee: the data safety monitoring committee will include the principal investigators from medicine/gastroenterology as well as the entire study team. two outside senior physician from gastroenterology or surgery will also be asked to participate. meetings will be convened if adverse events potentially related to the celiac block occur. 5.0 statistical considerations descriptive statistics will be performed for each group, and comparisons made to determine if the groups are balanced on the stratification factor of type of pancreatitis. patient characteristics will be compared between groups as well to determine if there is imbalance of other possible covariates. we expect that there will be patients with chronic pancreatitis secondary to congenital abnormalities of the pancreatic duct, ethanol abuse, familial, and idiopathic etiologies. the sample size of 90 patients was chosen based on preliminary sample size calculations. based on recent studies 30 of patients with pancreatitis type pain in the placebo arm will derive benefit.16 the predicted response rate of 51.5 for eus guided celiac block was based on the large review by kaufmann et al. for a 2 sided alpha of 0.05 and a power of 0.80, 83 patients would be necessary to show a difference. statistical analyses will be performed by biostatisticians at the biostatistical and bioinformatics resource group within the sc ctsi.",501,1.0
505,nct,a clinical trial analyzing effects of prokinetic drug on the blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes,2015,,cn-01553751,"with the improvement of living level, the incidence rates of diabetes, obesity, and hypertension in china increased quickly, which are 11.6, 7.1 and 18.8 respectively, according to the newly investigated data. the clustering of diabetes, obesity, hypertension and dyslipidemia increases the risk of cardiovascular events for patients. glp_1 (glucagon like peptide_1) is a kind of incretin discovered in recent years. it was reported that beside its hypoglycemic and losing weight effects, activator of glp_1 receptor could decrease blood pressure and improve lipid metabolism. sleeve gastrectomy can improve the level of blood glucose and serum lipid of type 2 diabetic rats by ameliorate insulin level and insulin resistance, which may be related with the change of gastrointestinal hormones such as ghrelin and glp_1. so, intervention of gastrointestinal tract and gastrointestinal hormone secretion may be a new therapy for glycolipids disorder and vascular complications. but, it is lack of evidence_based medicine proof on the relationship between prokinetic drug and glycolipids metabolism. so, the investigators designed a prospective, randomized, double_blinded, placebo control study, and try to evaluate the effects of prokinetic drug (mosapride) on the blood glucose and serum lipid in type 2 diabetic patients.",502,1.0

and/or anaphylaxis and/or allergic rhinitis later outcomes for the exploratory part of the study will be defined in terms of obesity, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. for assessments of food allergy, first determined at three years of age, we will harmonize study protocols with similar studies. interventions: skin intervention (is): skin care is performed from week 2 through 8 months of age, supervised by study personnel prior to leaving the hospital. food intervention (if): major food allergens (cows milk, peanut, wheat, egg) are introduced no later than 4.0 months of age as tastes, not interfering with nutrition. safety assessment: an external surveying committee to assess adverse events and main outcomes will be established prior to study start, to assess safety and potential needs for re_assessing interventions. the safety committee is offered free access to any data they need, at their discretion. statistical approaches: stratum randomization, logistic regression analyses (primary outcomes), mixed models (continuous outcomes particularly of allergic sensitization by quantification) will be applied. an external surveillance committee will monitor the safety aspects with availability to reports whenever, and whatever clinical or other criteria they deem appropriate. their assessment will have the potential to stop the trial in case of large differences in the groups. however, due to the short time span of observation before the interventions are completed, it is unlikely that intervention differences may be observed prior to completion. power analysis lack underlying data and is therefore based upon the prevalence environment and childhood asthma study (eca study) of ad at two years of age for skin barrier intervention only. the prevalence () of (ever) allergic disease in the eca study were at 2, 10 and 16 years of age: asthma: 8 (recurrent bronchial obstruction), 20 and 26.4, atopic eczema: 23.2, 33.2 and 34.8, allergic rhinitis (10 and 16 years): 19 and 32.1, allergic sensitization (10/16 years): 37.4 and 52.6, respectively. data on food allergy is lacking. the investigators pilot study suggested a prevalence reduction in ad from 16 to four at 6_months of age in children with dry skin subjected to skin care from 2 weeks. thus, an estimated reduction from 23.2 to 18.2 (five per cent points) in a general population would be highly clinically relevant, worthwhile and feasible and require 1030 children in each skin care versus observation group to attain an 80 power at 5 significance level. a reduction to 19.2 (four per cent points) requires 1638 children per group. in line with emerging study results (2015) the power_estimates will be repeated with potential modification of population size requirement until the target population is recruited. study phases: recent publications demonstrated approximately 30 reduction in atopic dermatitis at 32 weeks of age after daily use of skin care and 50 risk reduction at 6 months of age in 124 high risk children, respectively suggesting that approx. 1000 babies in each group would be sufficient to detect significant and relevant reductions in ad in a factorially 2x2 designed study. with many sub_studies we aim for 2400_2500 mother_child pairs. the first phase of the preventadall study to establish the birth cohort study, collect information and biological samples, closely assess the children in the first 3 years of life, assess the impact of the two interventions and the impact of microbiota and xenobiotic exposure on early allergic disease presentation. this phase will also create the foundation for a long_term follow_up study with careful assessments of potential risk or protective factors for allergic as well as other ncds at the start of life. the preventadall study will lead to improved nowledge of the potential effect of primary prevention and of management of allergic diseases in early life as well as improving knowledge of risk factors for ncds later in life.",504,1.0
508,nct,compare between two doses of palonosetron on the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting in obese patients,2016,,cn-01521770,"prevention of nausea and vomiting after surgery is a routine throughout anesthetic_surgical procedure, since the discomfort and morbidity associated with this anesthetic complication are widely known. the serotonin antagonists are largely used for this purpose because they exhibit superior prophylactic efficacy when compared with other antiemetic drugs. its mechanism of action is the inhibition of calcium influx caused by stimulation of serotonin 5_hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptor (5_ht3). palonosetron is a second generation serotonin antagonist with high affinity binding to the 5_ht3 receptor. it has a unique chemical structure and longer half_life than older 5_ht3 antagonists. it was initially approved for use in the prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting but also proved effective in the prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting. palonosetron is usually used in a fixed dose of 75 mcg for the prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting. although there are a few trials evaluating bodyweight_adjusted doses of palonosetron, the ideal dose of obese patient has not yet been investigated. aims objectives: the hypothesis for this study is that the use of bodyweight_adjusted doses of palonosetron (1mcg / kg) is more effective than a fixed dose (75mcg) for preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting in female patients with a body mass index equal to or above 30 kg / m2 whom have undergone breast surgery. methods: a prospective, randomized double_blind trial will be conducted at the national cancer institute (inca _ hciii), in rio de janeiro, brazil. all patients will be provided with written informed consent form prior to study enrolment. using computer_generated random numbers, the patients will be assigned into one of the two treatment groups on the morning of surgery. forty patients will be randomized to receive a fix dose of 75 _g of palonosetron (group i _ fix dose group) and another forty patients will receive a bodyweight_adjusted dose of 1mcg/kg of palonosetron (group ii _ bodyweight_adjusted group). each study drug will be mixed with saline to a total volume of 10 ml in an unlabelled syringe and will be intravenously administered just prior to induction of anesthesia. all patients, surgeons, anesthesiologists involved in the study will be blinded to group allocation to maintain the double_blind conditions. all episodes of nausea and vomiting will be recorded for 48h. patients will be assessed over 3 time periods: 0_6 h, 6_26 h and 24_48 h after surgery. after discharge, all patients will be contacted by telephone at regular intervals to record the episodes of nausea and vomiting as well as analgesic and antiemetic requirements. the primary outcome measure will include the number of emetic episodes, the incidence of nausea, the need for rescue antiemetics and the analgesic requirement after 48h. nausea is defined as a subjective unpleasant sensation associated with the urge to vomit without expulsion of gastric content and vomiting is defined as the forceful expulsion of gastric contents trough the mouth. the secondary outcome will be to evaluate the frequency of polymorphism of the 5_ht3 receptors and their correlation with the antiemetic effect and adverse effects. the patients will have cell samples of the oral cavity, collected through smear. the collected material will be placed in a tube and then will be stored at freezer. then, it will be analyzed in the laboratory of clinical research unit at the federal fluminense university (uff). after extracting the dna from the samples using a dna purification kit, a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) will be performed for analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms. biological samples will be discarded at the end of the analysis. all patients will receive premedication with midazolam. intraoperative monitoring included electrocardiography, blood pressure measurement, peripheral oxygen saturation (spo2), and end_tidal co2 tension (etco2). general anesthesia was induced using 1,5 mg/kg of propof l, 3 _g/kg of fentanyl, 1,5 mg/kg of lidocaine and 0.3 mg/kg of rocuronium. then the insertion of laryngeal mask will be performed and the pulmonary ventilation will be maintained with 6 ml/kg of ideal_weight and maximum peak pressure 25 cmh2o. the anesthesia will be maintained with sevoflurane in 50 oxygen/air. sevoflurane concentration was adjusted to ensure an equal depth of anesthesia during surgery as assessed by the bispectral index (bis bis a_1050 monitor, aspect medical systems, newton, ma, usa), which will be held between 40_60. remifentanil will be administered for supplemental intraoperative analgesia and its dose will be adjusted to maintain blood pressure and heart rate within 20 of baseline values. at the end of surgery, residual neuromuscular blockade will be reversed with 2mg/kg of sugammadex and the laryngeal mask will be removed. patients will stay on the postanesthetic care unit for at least 1 hour before going to the ward. in the postoperative recovery room, the haemodynamic variables along with postoperative complications such as shivering, hypotension, dizziness, constipation or any other adverse reaction to the drug will be recorded by a blinded observer. after surgery, rescue medication will be intravenous metoclopramide (10 mg) for more than one episodes of nausea or vomiting. sample size was calculated with reference to the results of a study comparing weight_adjusted doses of palonosetron for prevention of ponv in laparoscopic gynaecological surgery in no_obese patients. for a p value of 0.05 and a power of 0.8, a minimum of 36 per dose group was required. to allow for possible dropouts, the aim was to recruit 40 patients in each group. spss version 13.0 (spss inc, chicago, il,usa) will be used for statistical analysis. the shapiro_wilk test will be use to ensure that data will be normally distributed. patient characteristics and intra_ and post_operative variables will be analysed by two_tailed anova. for nonparametric variables, kruskal_wallis test will be applied. proportions will be compared using x2 square or fishers exact test. the dose_dependency effects of palonosetron will be assessed using the x2 trend test for proportions. a p value 0.05 is considered statistically significant.",505,1.0
509,nct,an intensive lifestyle intervention program in ckd (move to health 2),2016,,cn-01507014,"the study will be advertised at renal and transplant associates of new england (rtane) and interested patients will be screened and cleared by nephrologists from rtane to make sure that they do not have any contraindications to exercise as described by the american college of sports medicine. those patients who are eligible (stage 3_4, egfrs 15_59 ml/min/1.73m2) to participate, and who want to be involved , will be asked to read and sign a consent form, which had been reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of springfield college. this signing will take place at rtane prior to coming to the college. individuals will be randomly assigned to either the lifestyle intervention group or the usual care group. during the course of the study, serum potassium levels will be monitored on a monthly basis in all patients. for individuals randomized to the intervention group, if their levels are greater than 5.2 meq/l, these patients will be prescribed veltassa according to the recommended dosing scheme. individuals randomized to the usual care group will be under the care of their physicians and will receive the current standard of care. they will be able to take veltassa, if prescribed by their physician, but this will not be required by the study protocol. at baseline, and at month 6, when the blood samples are taken for potassium assessment, some of the sample will also be used for the assessment of other biomarkers that will be tracked in this study (e.g., phosphorus, inflammatory markers, etc) after 6 months of participation in the study, individuals will be retested with the same protocols used at baseline. pretest instructions: following the signing of the consent form, patients will be given instructions as to how to complete a 3_day diet log. patients will be asked to complete the exercise benefits/barriers scale (ebbs) and they will be expected to send these completed forms to the faculty at springfield college prior to arriving at the college for their day_long program. program day: patients will be expected to come to springfield college on a saturday and participate in the program from 8:45 am to approximately 4 pm depending upon their group assignment. upon arrival at the college, participants will be asked to have all the medications and over_the_counter drugs documented by clinical pharm d researchers. any participants who had not previously submitted their dietary information prior to coming will be asked to submit their logs at that time and a member of the research team will take their records and analyze them during the time while they are undergoing the other assessments. assessments during the morning period all patients are assessed for the following variables: anthropometrics: anthropometric measurements including height and weight will be taken. waist girth will be assessed using a tension tape measure (gulick) while body composition will be assessed using bioelectric impedance analysis (tanita, model bc_418). cardiovascular assessments: prior to performing any activity assessment for the day, patients will have their resting blood pressure determined, in their dominant arm, using a calibrated automated sphygmomanometer (tango, sun tech medical, morrisville, nc). they will also have pulse wave analysis (pwa) performed on them using a sphymocor machine (excel). this will give information about their augmentation index (a measure of arterial stiffness), along with a measure of their central blood pressure and pulse pressure. pharmacy methods: in the intervention group, the pharmacist will follow the following algorithm which is based on the most recent kdigo guidelines: 1. if the subject is on a ras blocker, the pharmacist will titrate the dose up to maximal dose in order to achieve a bp 130/80. functional movement screen (fms): each participant will be assessed on their ability to perform each of the following movements without restriction: deep squat, active straight leg raise, shoulder mobility, trunk stability push up. a score is assigned based upon how well these move ents are performed. functional tests: following the anthropometric assessments, a series of functional tests will be administered. the six minute walk test will be performed with each participant according to american thoracic society guidelines. a 20_meter, flat hallway will be used as the course with cones set at each end as a marker. every 3 feet will be marked along the course. chairs will be available to the participants at both ends of the course, as well as the middle distance mark. participants will be instructed to complete the most distance in the time allotted, only walking. at each minute, the participants will be told you are doing well, you have 5 (4, 3, 2, 1) minutes to go. when 15 seconds are left, the participants will be told to wait for a stop command and instructed to stop wherever they are on the course. the partial lap distance will then be recorded and added to the total lap distance. the sit_to_stand_to_sit test will also be used for all participants. a sturdy, armless chair with a height of 43.7 cm will be used. each participant will be instructed to fold their hands over their chest and complete one practice sit_to_stand_to_sit. it will be made clear that no hands are allowed to be used. then, each participant will be instructed to sit up and down ten times as fast as they can and the time to complete this will be recorded in seconds. a short physical performance battery (sppb) score will be created by summation of the scores for tests of standing balance, gait speed, and rising from a chair 5 times. the sppb has been shown to have excellent reliability and predictive validity for a number of outcomes including mortality, onset of disability, and institutionalization, and has been used in large, multicenter, randomized controlled trials and observational studies as a primary outcome and for screening purposes. grip strength: grip strength will be assessed using a jamar hand held dynamometer. participants will be asked to sit in a chair while flexing their dominant arm to a 90 angle. the dynamometer will be fitted to each individuals hand and then each participant will be asked to exert maximal effort three times. the highest recorded score (in kg) will be used in statistical analyses. after these testing sessions are completed, individuals assigned to the usual care group will receive dietary advice and then be allowed to go home while individuals randomized to the intervention groups will be given instructions as to how to prepare a plant_based meal by a professional chef at the colleges dining services. following lunch, each participant will rotate through each of the following stations to receive one_on_one counseling from experts in the specific areas based upon their own specific scores from their earlier assessments. the following section contains information regarding the specific information that will be covered in each of those areas: 2. if the patient has an elevated urinary albumin excretion, the ras inhibitor dose will also be titrated to the maximal dose. strength/power assessments: baseline strength and power will also be assessed with the dominant leg (quadriceps and hamstrings) using isokinetic dynamometry (biodex). the purpose of the test will be explained to the participants. each participant will then be strapped into the seat securely using chest straps, a lap strap and leg strap. the straps are to ensure no accessory muscles are used during the test. the participant will then be adjusted into the machine so that the fulcrum of the lateral aspect of the dominant knee is exactly aligned with axis or rotation on the machine. all baseline adjustments will be recorded for each participant at this point. once the participant is ready to engage, their information regarding rom and weight of the limb will be adjusted according to computer program procedures. each participant will be given a trial round of 4 repetitions and will be instructed to push and pull with their leg as hard as they could. then, 3 rounds of testing will be completed at 5 repetit ons for each speed of 90/120/150 degrees per seconds. each participant will be reminded to breathe, and not hold their breath during the time they are being assessed. strength and power measurements will then be recorded for each participant. behavioral methods instruments: kidney disease and quality of life (kdqol) _ short form (12). the kdqol_36 is a short form that includes the sf_12 as generic core supplemented with multi_item scales targeted at particular concerns of individuals with kidney disease (i.e. the burden of kidney disease, symptoms/problems of kidney disease, and effects of kidney disease scales on daily life). the kdqol_sf is derived from the kdqol(13), the long_form of the questionnaire, whose use is limited by its length (134 items). the questionnaire is one of the most complete instruments currently available to assess the health related quality of life (hrqol) of patients because it includes general and specific aspects of health, allowing a more complete evaluation of hrqol dimensions that are relevant for the patients . the authors of the kdqol developed a standalone excel scoring tool which was used to score the instrument. the self_efficacy to regulate exercise habits questionnaire. self_efficacy to regulate exercise habits relates to the belief that one can perform exercise activities in the face of impediments (e.g.., fatigue, time constraints, unfavorable environmental conditions, and competing demands). subjects will rate themselves on scales that range from 0 (cannot do) through intermediate degrees of assurance, 50 (moderately certain can do) to complete assurance, 100 (highly certain can do). the self_efficacy to regulate eating habits questionnaire (cronbach alpha 0.93) subjects will be asked to rate their confidence in being able to stick to healthy eating habits when faced with different tempting situations (e.g. when very hungry, when eating out with others, during holiday times, when feeling upset). subjects rate themselves on scales that range from 0 (cannot do) through intermediate degrees of assurance, 50 (moderately certain can do) to complete assurance, 100 (highly certain can do). follow_up contact will be made via email by the same counselor who met with the patient at the assessment visit, at one week post_assessment and monthly thereafter. these emails will focus on the extent to which patients have achieved their goals since last contact, and patients will be reinforced or assisted in problem_solving additional strategies as appropriate. patients will also receive additional written materials tailored to their current concerns (e.g. focusing on lapse and relapse, discussion of time management strategies, and cues to get back into an activity plan after holidays). participants in the intervention conditions will be given brief individualized counselling to achieve their lifestyle goals. participants will meet one_on_one with a behavioral health counselor to develop their personalized self_management program. a program will be formulated for each patient in which manageable goals for lifestyle change are negotiated, and specific individually tailored intervention strategies to increase self_efficacy and decrease barriers to change will be developed. the key features of the intervention will be a) assessment of current physical activity and dietary habits, b) investigating the perceived benefits, barriers and costs of behavior change, c) patient participation in goal setting and selecting personalized strategies to overcome barriers and prevent relapse, and d) establishing follow_up contacts. regular self_assessment will be used to empower participants to take responsibility for their own decisions and to make informed choices. a clinical pharmd researcher will conduct patient interviews. preparation for the interviews include contacting the participants requesting that they bring all prescription and over_the_counter medications to the move to health study. patients will be specifically informed to bring all pres ription (including those only taken as needed), over the counter medications (such as medicine for sleep, allergies, etc.), vitamins, herbals, creams and inhalers used within the past month. at the beginning of the move to health study, participants will provide their bag of medications to the pharmacist. while the patients are completing the initial phases of the study, the pharmacist will document each medication including dosage, sig, days supply and last refill date, and will evaluate each medication for nephrotoxic effects, interactions, contraindications and medication appropriateness in ckd. this will be done for each patient without the pharmacists knowledge of patient randomization group. any medication that is identified as potentially harmful or nephrotoxic for any patient will be addressed with the lead physician of the study group for further discussion. 3. if the potassium is 5.2, veltassa will be provided and dosed according to the pi nutrition methods participants will be required to keep a 3_day food log prior to the day_long program. the information from the food logs will be analyzed with a food processor diet analysis software program (esha, salem, or) for nutritional content. the esha food processor nutrition analysis software is widely used to assess the nutrient content of food in both research and clinical practice. the software provides analyses for more than 55,000 foods and food items, providing analysis for more than 163 nutritional components. planned follow up all participants in the move to health study will be expected to return to the college approximately one, three and 6 months to be reassessed with the identical procedures as performed at the initial visit. standard ckd labs (cbc, electrolytes, bun, creatinine, pth. magnesium, uric acid and urinary albumin excretion) will be measured at each assessment. once patients are randomized, those assigned to the intervention groups will meet individually with the pharmacist. patients in the usual care group are excused without pharmacy associated changes as long as there are no medications identified as potentially harmful or nephrotoxic. a detailed patient medication history will be obtained, including the current dose schedule and patient reported side effects. adherence and associated barriers will be assessed using the morisky 8_point adherence tool (mmsa_8). patients will also be asked specifically, within the past week, how many doses of medication have you missed based upon the information gathered, the pharmacist will make evidence_based interventions. interventions include providing each patient with a recommended dosing schedule, appropriate timing in relation to food and other medications, and tools to improve adherence. these tools include recommending pill organizers, timers and decreasing medication dosing frequency. medication schedule will be based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics considerations as well as therapeutic guideline recommendations. the administration of the drug will comply with the standard operating procedures followed at rtane (see attached sop). the medications will be stored at rtane in a research refrigerator that is maintained at 2_8 c temperature and when dispensed to subjects they will be told to do the same. this research refrigerator is monitored to make sure that it is keeping the stored medications at the correct temperature. patients will be educated about medication indication, otc and herbal medications to eliminate and to avoid (e.g., nsaids). patients will be provided an opportunity to ask medication related questions that will be addressed individually by the pharmacist. _ wall latissimus dorsi stretch. subjects will also be instructed to aim to walk for at least 30 minutes, 5 times per week at a moderate intensity to comply with standard physical activity recommendations of accumulating at least 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity physical activity. they will be instructed to avoid prolonged periods of time engaging in sedentary behavior by aiming to reduce s tting time. examples of ways to reduce this sedentary behavior will be discussed with each participant and they will be encouraged to implement strategies that could work for them. some that could be used include standing during commercial breaks while watching television and consciously taking movement breaks during each hour by setting a timer for 15_20 intervals. during the dietary consultation, the diet analysis will be reviewed with the participant, regarding their individual dietary macronutrient and micronutrient content. specific attention will be paid to the amount and quality of protein, as well as the amount of sodium, phosphorous, and potassium contained in the diet. recommendations for dietary modifications will be based on a vegan approach. participants in the intervention group will be encouraged to decrease the amount of animal protein in their diet and choose more plant_based meals. the quality of animal protein will be addressed with red meat and dairy products most highly discouraged, followed by poultry, and fish. education will be provided on the significance of reducing sodium, phosphorous, and potassium on kidney health. strategies to reduce the intake of these micronutrients will be presented, specifically what types of foods to avoid and what types to include more of in the diet. individual barriers to success in achieving the suggested dietary modifications will be addressed, and strategies to implement the changes will be discussed based on the participants individual circumstances. participants will also attend lunch with a cooking education session, in which a professional chef will demonstrate how to prepare a vegan meal. during this session, strategies to enhance the flavor and appeal of plant_based meals will be presented to aid participants in being able to practically include plant_based meals in their daily diet. the treatment group will have an unrestricted potassium diet. individuals randomized to the control group will be counseled on a standard 1 gram/kg protein diet with 2 gram potassium and sodium restriction. dietary adherence will be assessed in the control and intervention group using a food frequency questionnaire (ffq). a standard portion size and six possible frequency of consumption responses, ranging from never to two or more times per day will be given for each food group based on food and nutrients emphasized or minimized in the prescribed diet (i.e., animal protein, sodium, and potassium). physical fitness methods: based upon the performance of the fms, individuals will be counseled with regard to the types of exercises they should perform. the prescribed exercises will be demonstrated and taught to the subjects so that when they leave to go home they know how to perform the exercises in correct form. examples of exercises that could be demonstrated are as follows: _ wall hip hinge _ chair squat _ dumbbell bent over row _ seated horizontal band row _ seated vertical band row _ elevated push up and wall push up _ seated one arm dumbbell press, _ band curl, _ band triceps push down each participant will be also given a set of stretches to perform and will be taught how to perform these stretches by the research staff members responsible for fitness. examples of stretches that could be used are as follows: _ wall calf stretch _ seated and standing hamstring stretch _ chair quadriceps stretch _ wall chest stretch physical activity monitoring: by the end of the testing day, each participant will be given a gt3xpb actigraph monitor (actigraph, pensacola, fl) with instructions to wear the monitor for the following 7 days. they will then be asked to return this monitor to the research coordinator who will download the data for storage and later analysis. this process will be repeated each time participants come to the college for testing. objective data captured by the actigraph system (i.e., mean times spent in sedentary behavior, light, and moderate to vigorous physical activity) will be used to compare physical activity and sedentary b havior in the intervention and control group as a measure of exercise adherence. as previously stated, participants in the intervention group will be issued with a packet of exercises to do at home. this packet will contain simple step by step instructions and illustrations of how to perform these movements with correct form. prior to leaving the college for the day, each of these exercises will be demonstrated to each participant and they will be taught how to perform these exercises in correct form. a member of the research group will contact them (either by phone or email) at the beginning of each week during the intervention period to review with them the exercise program for the week to come and to discuss any challenges that they might have encountered in the previous week. the means of communication used will be decided upon depending upon the preference of the participant. during these weekly communications, the member from the research team will review the strategies the participant has been using to reduce sedentary behavior and provide encouragement in these endeavors. participants will also be required to keep a log of their activities and return this log to the research team when they return for their retest dates. the activity log serves as a motivational tool and as an aid for the research team to supervise (and adapt if necessary) the exercise program. participants will be encouraged to contact the research coordinator at any time if they have any questions or need clarification while performing their home_based exercise program. data storage all study data will be collected and managed using research electronic data capture) redcap electronic data capture tools. redcap is a secure (password protected), web_based application designed to support data capture for research studies, providing: 1) an intuitive interface for validated data entry 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures 3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages and 4) procedures for importing data from external sources. the computers on which the electronic data will be stored will be password protected and the pi other members of the research team will know the code. apart from the pi, graduate students who will help with data entry, under the pis supervision and the statistician, will be the only individuals who will have access to the data. to maintain subject confidentiality, upon entry into the study subjects will be assigned a number and that number will be linked to their data in the spreadsheet of the statistical program. no names will be directly linked to the data entered into the statistical program. random checks of the accuracy of the data entered into the statistical package will be done by the study coordinator and the statistician.",506,1.0

511,nct,assessing the value of ehealth for bariatric surgery,2017,,cn-01578578,"bariatric surgery is the only treatment with long standing effect of morbid obesity. the key elements to success are the patient_selection, an experienced bariatric team and a completed follow_up program. follow_up programs can consist of, for example, providing social support in support groups, teaching psychological skills, such as coping with the body change or teaching self_regulation of body weight. furthermore, follow_up is important for dietary and sports counselling. the experience of the team members and coaching skills are essential in indicating the suitable procedure if necessary and guide the patients through the process. various studies showed a significant positive effect of a completed follow_up program after bariatric surgery on maintaining weight loss. there is a burden for this on site provided care as organizational and financial resources are not unlimited. especially as the follow_up period is an obligatory 5 years or if possible life long. even if this aftercare is provided, not all patients complete the complete program. various reasons are possible for an increasing no_show_rate, the loss of enthusiasm for onsite visits could be one of them. analogue to other chronic diseases, the addition of telehealth could be useful. telehealth is the delivery of health_related services and information via telecommunications technologies. it encompasses preventative, promotive and curative aspects. examples are exchanging health services or education via videoconference, transmission of medical data for disease management (remote monitoring) and advice on prevention of diseases and promotion of good health by patient monitoring and follow_up. the participation of ehealth has been investigated and considered useful in the treatment of obesity. in a systematic review self_measured blood pressure monitoring was associated with better control of hypertension at least in the first year. its value in a bariatric tract has not been investigated. it can be hypothesized that self_control by ehealth could enhance clinical outcome as more weight loss and comorbidity reduction. long_term realistic goals setting, consistent use of routines and self_monitoring has been proven effective for weight loss maintenance. patients with higher self_control are more certain regarding their abilities, which cause higher commitment and adherence to the program. this eventually leads to more weight loss. for this purpose an online monitoring program was designed for our obesity centre (bepatient) to provide preoperative information as well as aids in the post_bariatric phase by self_control wireless devices for registration of biometric outcomes, teleconference opportunities and access to additional information. in a prospective trial the implementation in several degrees is evaluated.",508,1.0

the most frequent cause of death in the intensive care unit (icu) as the investigators demonstrated in a recent chilean prevalence study. several pathogenic factors such as hypovolemia, myocardial depression, vasoplegia, and microcirculatory abnormalities can induce progressive tissue hypoperfusion in severe cases. in this context, persistent hyperlactatemia has been traditionally considered as the hallmark of ongoing tissue hypoxia during septic shock, and therefore lactate normalization is recommended as a resuscitation target by the surviving sepsis campaign (ssc). pathophysiologic determinants of persistent hyperlactatemia the physiologic basis of lactate generation or clearance during septic shock has been matter of active research. hypovolemia_induced hypoperfusion is probably the predominant pathogenic mechanism during the early phase. some patients resolve acute circulatory dysfunction and clear lactate after initial fluid resuscitation, while others evolve into a persistent circulatory dysfunction with hyperlactatemia. several mechanisms have been associated to persistent hyperlactatemia besides hypoperfusion, but recent literature has highlighted the role of sustained hyperadrenergia with increased muscle aerobic glycolysis, a condition denominated stress hyperlactatemia, and also of impaired hepatic lactate clearance. is hyperlactatemia a valid resuscitation target in septic shock not surprisingly, lactate clearance or normalization is used worldwide as resuscitation targets. indeed, ssc the most ambitious and global collaboration in critical care has proposed to focus septic shock resuscitation on normalizing macrohemodynamic parameters and lactate. ssc guidelines are followed in many countries and adherence to recommended management bundles have been reported to be associated to improved survival, although the role of each individual component is not clear. lactate clearance, defined by a change of lactate levels between two time_points, and expressed as a 10_20 hourly lactate reduction, or a decrease of at least 10 in 6h during early resuscitation has been related to survival, and tested as a goal in two important studies with conflicting results. potential alternative resuscitation targets in septic shock peripheral perfusion as a potential resuscitation target in septic shock patients the skin territory lacks auto_regulatory flow control, and therefore sympathetic activation impairs skin perfusion during circulatory dysfunction, a process that could be evaluated by peripheral perfusion assessment. indeed, peripheral perfusion can be easily evaluated in many ways at bedside, and therefore, it could be a valuable monitoring tool in any setting. the presence of a cold clammy skin, mottling or crt are frequently described as indications to initiate fluid resuscitation in patients with sepsis_related acute circulatory dysfunction. why to compare peripheral perfusion with lactate as targets for septic shock resuscitation design multicenter, open_label randomized controlled study, conducted under supervision of an independent data safety monitoring board (dsmb). the investigators have explored the significance and potential determinants of hyperlactatemia in a series of clinical physiological studies performed over the last 15 years. these studies have addressed the three most relevant pathogenic factors involved in persisten hyperlactatemia: overt or occult hypoperfusion, hyperadrenergic state and impaired hepatic clearance. the complexity of this subject is also highlighted by a more recent study where the investigators demonstrated that lactate decrease during successful septic shock resuscitation exhibits a biphasic pattern, an early rapid decrease in parallel to normalization of more flow_sensitive variables (see below), followed by a slower recovery thereafter. the latter eventually related to non_flow dependent mechanisms such as hyperadrenergic state and/or delayed hepatic clearance. persistent hyperlactatemia after initial resuscitation is particularly difficult to interpret as suggested by the extensive research summarized above. optimizing systemic blood flow might reverse ongoing hypoperfusion, a potential source of anaerobic lactate generation. under this perspective, some of the pathogenic factors involved in hyperlactatemia are potentially flow_sensitive, and others are not. distinction between the two scenarios could strongly impact further resuscitation. if persistent hyperlactatemia is caused by non_hypoperfusion_related mechanisms, then sustained efforts aimed at increasing co could lead to detrimental effects of excessive fluids or inotropes, a fact now well demonstrated in the literature. the decision of when to consider that a patient has been fully resuscitated and as a consequence stop further interventions is a milestone, and appears as highly relevant since the results of a number of recent studies have increased awareness about the risk of fluid overload and/or of vasopressors and inodilators such as pulmonary edema, increased intraabdominal hypertension, acute kidney injury, delayed weaning, arrhythmias, hepatosplanchnic or myocardial ischemia, among other problems. by these means, over_resuscitation could eventually increase morbidity and/or mortality. the concept of crt, the most relevant parameter, is based on this assumption. it was proposed initially in trauma patients but some negative studies that found no correlation with systemic hemodynamics precluded further research on this variable. more recently however, lima et al found that abnormal peripheral perfusion is associated with hyperlactatemia and organ dysfunctions in critically ill patients. other authors confirmed this finding and built up a robust body of evidence supporting the strong prognostic value of abnormal peripheral perfusion in the intensive care unit (icu) context. how can fluid loading and resuscitation improve peripheral perfusion there is an intricate relationship between macrohemodynamics and peripheral perfusion. both are affected by hypovolemia and tend to improve in parallel in fluid_responsive patients. their relative changes, though, are not well correlated. the beneficial effects of fluids and vasoactive drugs may be explained by an increase in co or perfusion pressure, a decrease in the neurohumoral response to hypovolemia, and eventually by direct effects at the microcirculatory level. whatever the mechanism, normalization of peripheral perfusion parameters appears to indicate a successful reversal of initial circulatory dysfunction. main objective to test if peripheral perfusion targeted resuscitation in septic shock is associated with lower 28_day mortality than a lactate targeted resuscitation. primary outcome all_cause 28_day mortality i. patients inclusion criteria adult patients (18 years) will be screened for the following inclusion criteria: exclusion criteria however, there are several unresolved aspects and concerns about the role of lactate as an appropriate resuscitation target. first, it is not clear if selecting lactate clearance versus lactate normalization as resuscitation goals is equivalent, but more importantly, if this decision leads to similar timely resolution of tissue hypoperfusion or hypoxia. second, since non_hypoperfusion related causes of hyperlactatemia might predominate in an unknown number of patients, this could lead to over_resuscitation in at least some of them as st ted above. third, the dynamics of recovery of lactate might exhibit a biphasic pattern and therefore, the real_time response of lactate to fluid challenges could be not straightforward depending on the hypoperfusion context. some survivors might even normalize lactate only after 24h of evolution. therefore, to explore other potential resuscitation targets appears as mandatory. a foremost priority is to rule out ongoing hypoperfusion in septic septic shock patients under active resuscitation. the investigators recently proposed that a simultaneous analysis of central venous o2 saturation (scvo2), central venous_arterial pco2 gradient (p(cv_a)co2), and peripheral perfusion as assessed by capillary refill time (crt), mottling score or central_to_toe temperature differences, might be helpful in suggesting a hypoperfusion context for patients with or without hyperlactatemia. from a theoretical point of view, these three easily assessable perfusion_related variables offer an important advantage over lactate as potential resuscitation targets in septic shock patients: they are clearly flow_sensitive and exhibit a much faster dynamics of recovery after systemic blood flow optimization. in other words, these parameters might clear in minutes in fluid_responsive patients as compared to lactate, which sometimes takes hours to recover. the investigators demonstrated this by analyzing the dynamics of recovery of these parameters in a cohort of ultimately surviving septic shock patients. scvo2, p(cv_a)co2 and crt where already normal in almost 70 of the patients after 2h of fluid resuscitation, as compared with only 15 in the case of lactate. more recently bakker et al, added another important piece of information after performing a pilot study in 30 septic shock patients subjected to early resuscitation. in this study, crt and skin mottling were correlated with the pulsatility index, a sonographic surrogate of vascular tone, of visceral organs. this means that improvement in peripheral perfusion might move in parallel with improvement in hepatosplanchnic perfusion, eventually explaining the good prognosis associated with recovery of crt and other related parameters. using peripheral perfusion to target resuscitation in septic shock has also several potential drawbacks. first, there is some degree of subjectivity and inter_observer variability in some of the parameters used to assess it such as crt and mottling. second, it cannot be evaluated in some settings such as dark skin patients. third, and more importantly, the corpus of evidence that supports that improvement of peripheral perfusion is associated with resolution of profound tissue or microcirculatory hypoperfusion, or hypoxia is still scanty. 1. pregnancy 2. anticipated surgery or dialysis procedure during the first 8h after septic shock diagnosis 3. do_not_resuscitate status 4. child b or c liver cirrhosis 5. active bleeding 6. acute hematological malignancy 7. severe concomitant acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) 8. more than 4h after officially meeting septic shock criteria however, there are also a couple of drawbacks for some of these perfusion_related flow_sensitive parameters. scvo2 is a complex physiological variable. it was widely used until recently as the resuscitation goal in critically ill patients, although several limitations may preclude a straightforward interpretation of its changes. for instance, normal or even supranormal scvo2 values do not rule_out global or regional tissue hypoxia for several reasons that have been highlighted elsewhere, but that include severe microcirculatory derangements impairing tissue o2 extraction capabilities. vallee et al found persistent abnormal p(cv_a)co2 values in 50 of septic shock patients who had already achieved normal scvo2 values after initial resuscitation. nevertheless, in some hyperdynamic states a high efferent venous blood flow could be sufficient to wash out the global carbon dioxide (co2) generation from hypoperfused tissues and thus, p(cv_a)co2 could be normal despi e the presence of tissue hypoxia. another problem for these two variables is that they necessarily require a central venous catheterization to be assessed, a task that might be complex to perform in limited_resource settings or emergency departments (ed). therefore, peripheral perfusion appears as the most promising alternative resuscitation target in septic shock patients. the investigators observed that crt was the first parameter to be normalized in a cohort of septic shock patients and this predicted lactate normalization at 24h and survival. moreover, some recent clinical data suggest that targeting peripheral perfusion during septic shock resuscitation might improve outcome. van genderen et al performed a randomized controlled trial comparing two resuscitation protocols one targeted at normal peripheral perfusion and the other to standard management in 30 icu patients. the study demonstrated that targeting peripheral perfusion is safe, and associated with less fluid administration and organ dysfunctions. therefore, a parameter like crt with a rapid_response time could be very useful to test the response to treatments with strong physiologic impact such as fluid loading, especially at the ed or in limited_resource settings. in a prospective non published study performed in a cohort of 100 patients just admitted to the ed, the investigators found that patients exhibiting a normal crt after initial fluid loading had a hospital mortality of less than 10 as compared to 55 in patients with abnormal values. however, the excellent prognosis associated with crt recovery, the rapid_response time to fluid loading, the simplicity of its assessment, its availability in limited resource settings, and recent data suggesting that it might change in parallel to perfusion of physiologically more relevant territories such as the hepatosplanchnic region, constitute a strong background to promote studies evaluating its usefulness to guide resuscitation in septic shock patients. hypothesis peripheral perfusion guided resuscitation in septic shock is associated with lower mortality, less organ dysfunctions, less mechanical ventilation (mv), less vasopressor load, and less renal replacement therapies than a lactate_targeted resuscitation strategy. there are some data that suggest that vasopressor adjustment and/or inodilators could induce favorable effects on peripheral perfusion or microcirculation under certain circumstances. jhanji et al demonstrated that increasing mean arterial pressure (map) to 90 mmhg with norepinephrine (ne) doses up to 0.41 mcg/kg/min improved cutaneous tissue oxygen pressure (pto2) and cutaneous microvascular red blood cell flux in a cohort of septic shock patients. the same group obtained similar results in another cohort of postoperative patients after major abdominal surgery but with an intervention consisting in stroke volume optimization with fluid challenges and an inodilator (dopexamine) in fixed dose. dubin et al demonstrated that rising map to 85 mmhg with incremental doses of norepinephrine (ne) up to 0.74 mcg/kg/min improved sublingual microcirculatory flow in septic shock patients with the worst microcirculation at baseline. dobutamine in fixed doses of 5 mcg/kg/min improved sublingual microcirculatory flow in another cohort of septic shock patients. on the other hand active vasodilation with nitroglycerine induced a clear improvement of peripheral perfusion parameters in a group of shock patients, despite a mean fall in map of 14 mmhg. based on these findings and other data, it was proposed that permisive hypotension could eventually improve microcirculatory driving_pressure in patients with acute circulatory failure. in summary, it appears that pharmacological therapies aimed at improving peripheral perfusion might be individually tailored but could imply increasing or lowering vasopressors and map, inodilators or pure vasodilators according to the clinical context. summarizing the theoretical background stated above, it is plausible that normalization of peripheral perfusion as comp red to normalization or a rapid decrease (20/2h) of lactate might be associated with less fluid resuscitation and secondarily less positive 24h fluid balances. eventually, less positive fluid balances might be associated with less organ dysfunctions, especially respiratory (oxygenation, mechanical ventilation days), renal (less increase in creatinine and renal replacement therapy), and gastrointestinal (less increase in intra_abdominal pressure). in addition, peripheral perfusion targeted_resuscitation might be also associated with less vasopressor load and inodilator use thus preventing other set of potential complications such as hepatosplanchnic hypoperfusion, arrhythmias or myocardial ischemia. at the end, this could result in less mortality for a combination of the previous reasons. secondary outcomes need of mechanical ventilation need of renal replacement therapies (rrt) days free of mv, vasopressors

hypotension requiring norepinephrine (ne) to maintain a mean arterial pressure (map) of 65 mmhg, and serum lactate levels 2 mmol/l after initial fluid resuscitation with at least 20/ml kg in one hour. ii. randomization recruited patients will be randomized to a peripheral perfusion_targeted resuscitation (group a) with a goal of normalizing capillary refill time (crt), or a lactate_targeted resuscitation (group b) with a goal of either normalizing lactate or achieving a 20 decrease per hour during the 8h study period. the randomization sequence will be generated by an external statistician of the dsmb with the use of a computer program and an allocation of 1:1. the randomization using a block size of eight will be stratified according to participating centers. allocation concealment will be maintained by means of a web_based central, automated randomization system, available 24 hours a day (redcap cloud). the group to which the patient is allocated will only be disclosed after the information is recorded in the electronic system. such measure prevents the investigator and the medical team from predicting to which treatment group the patient will be allocated. to include a patient in the study, investigators must simply access the study website and fill in a short medical record form. statisticians and the researcher responsible for event assignment will be blinded to the group allocation. treatment assignment will not be recorded in the medical chart or electronic patient data monitoring system and clinicians on general wards, who care for the patients after icu discharge, will not be aware of the treatment assignment. iii. assessments baseline demographics, comorbidities, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (apache)

and 90 days cause of death iv. principles of general management sepsis source identification and treatment should be pursued as a priority of first line treatment. a central venous catheter and an arterial line are inserted in all, and the use of a pulmonary artery catheter or a picco device is recommended for patients with a past medical history of heart failure or with concomitant ards. echocardiography will be performed routinely as soon as possible after admission to evaluate basal cardiac function, and repeated as necessary to aid in assessing preload status through inferior vena cava distensibility when necessary. ne will be the vasopressor of choice and adjusted to a map 65 mmhg in all patients. c. study protocol the study period will be of 8 hours and after this, attending intensivists can continue treatment according to their usual practice or department protocol. fluid responsiveness (fr) this is the first step. fr will be assessed with a structured approach. basically, dynamic predictors (dp) will be evaluated depending on the patient background status. hemoglobin concentrations will be maintained at 8 g/dl or higher to optimize arterial o2 content. mechanical ventilation settings are adjusted according to current recommendation. rescue therapies such as epinephrine, vasopressin analogues, steroids or different blood purification techniques like high_volume hemofiltration will be decided following usual practice of the involved centers in patients evolving with refractory septic shock. a sequential approach to resuscitation will be followed in both groups. time 0 is the starting point when after randomization, a central venous catheter (cvc) and an arterial line are in place, and the basal measurements are performed including hemodynamics and blood sampling. i. tests and procedures during the study period capillary refill time assessment crt will be measured by applying firm pressure to the ventral surface of the right index finger distal phalanx with a glass microscope slide. the pressure will be increased until the skin is blank and then maintained for 10 seconds. the time for return of the normal skin color will be registered with a chronometer, and 3 seconds is defined as abnormal. lactate measurements a normal lactate value is defined as less then 2 mmol/l. lactate will be assessed with the technique more easily available for each center, including arterial serum levels (with common gas analyzers at the central lab), or capillary levels with lactate scout strips. in sedated adapted mechanically ventilated patients without arrhythmias, pulse pressure variation (ppv) or stroke volume variation (svv) will be used as first choice. a fr status is established with values 13 and 10, respectively. if negative, ppv and svv will be reassessed after transiently increasing tidal volume (vt) to 8 ml/kg (one minute). an increase 3.5 and 2.5 in ppv or svv, respectively will be considered as fr. in patients with arrhythmia, the preferred tests will be the end expiratory occlusion test with a 15 sec pause ( pulse pressure 5 considered as positive), or echocardiography assessing inferior vena cava (ivc) distensibility index (15 considered as ). in spontaneous breathing patients or non_sedated patients under mv, a passive leg rising (plr) maneuver will performed with an early (1min) increase in pulse pressure 10 considered as fr. if this is not obtained and to rule out a false negative response, the maneuver will be repeated assessing aortic velocity time integral (vti) with echocardiography before and after plr with a 15 increase in vti accepted as fr. fluid challenge in fr patients, the first resuscitation step is to administer a fluid bolus (fb) of 500 ml of crystalloids every 30 min until crt is normalized in group a, or dp becomes negative in group b. dp and cvp will be measured before a d after each bolus in both groups. safety measures during fluid challenges central venous pressure (cvp) and fr will be reevaluated after any fluid challenge. if cvp increases 5 mmhg and fr is still , another fb is administered and so on while the goal is not reached. if cvp increases 5 mmhg or fr is _, fluids will be stopped and the patient will be moved to the next step. vasopressor test in fr_ patients with persistent abnormal crt or with a still abnormal lactate that decreased 20/2h, a vasopressor test will be performed. the investigators will analyze the effects of the study fluids on the primary outcome in the following subgroups: 1. patients with lactate 4.0 mmol/l as set by ssc 2. patients without a confirmed source of infection (as this could increase the translation of the study to other critically ill). 3. patients with low apache ii / sofa scores 4. patients with a more than 10 difference in lactate level between the very first one measured and the baseline when starting the study. in previously hypertensive patients, map will be increased to the range of 80_85 mmhg by transiently rising ne doses. crt and lactate rechecked (crt at one h and lactate at 2h). if crt is normal in the group a, or lactate normalizes or decreases 20 in group b, resuscitation will be stopped and ne dose maintained. if not, ne will be reduced to the pre_test doses, and the protocol moves to the next step. in all the other patients, map will be reduced to the range of 60_65 mmhg by transient decreases in ne doses, with the same objectives and principles as stated above. use of inodilators dobutamine 5 mcg/kg/min or milrinone 0.25 mcg/kg/min in fixed doses will be started, and crt or lactate rechecked (crt at one h and lactate at 2h). if, the goals are not reached, drugs will be discontinued and no further action will be taken during the study period, except recheck fr every hour and restart fluid challenges if patients get fr again. in responders (same criteria as with vasopressor test), the inodilator will be continued along the study period. as a safety measure, inodilators will be stopped if hr increases 15, or arrhythmias, ischemia or hypotension develop. group a. management of peripheral perfusion_targeted resuscitation. in this group, the goal is to normalize crt by following the next steps in the given order: 1. assessment of fr 2. fluid challenges until crt is normal, the patient is fluid unresponsive or a safety measure is met 3. vasopressor test 4. inodilator test as a safety measure, resuscitation will be stopped even with normal crt only in the presence of a stable macrohemodynamics as demonstrated by heart rate (hr) 120 beats per minute, and stable map with no increase in vasopressors during the last hour. after crt normalization at any step, crt will be reassessed hourly during the study period. if at any point, it turns abnormal again the resuscitation sequence will be restarted. group b. management of lactate_targeted resuscitation. in this group the goal is to normalize lactate levels or get a decrease rate of at least 20/2h, by following the next steps in the given order, always reevaluating lactate at 2h intervals. 1. assessment of fr 2. fluid challenges until fr_ or safety cvp limit is reached during the bi_hourly intervals between lactate assessments 3. vasopressor test 4. inodilators lactate will be assessed every two hours during the 8h study period. if after obtaining the lactate goal, lactate gets abnormal again or the decrease rate turns 20/2h at any of the following bi_hourly controls during the study period, the resuscitation sequence will be restarted. d. sample size mortality in patients with increased lactate levels in circulatory dysfunction has been shown to exceed 40. in addition, several studies have shown that abnormal peripheral perfusion is associated with a mortality exceeding 40. the investigators should enroll 420 patients. with these sample size the study will have 90 power to detect a reduction in 28_day mortality from 45 to 30, at a significance evel of 5, considering time_to_event analysis. the investigators consider a decrease of 15 in mortality to have direct clinical implementation effect. similar effects on mortality have been shown in early resuscitation studies. in addition limiting fluid administration in patients with septic shock and normal peripheral perfusion has been shown to decrease organ failure, which is the leading cause of death in these patients. e. statistical analysis plan a detailed statistical analysis plan will be prepared before proceeding to patient enrolment. the essential characteristics of this statistical analysis plan are described below. when aiming for a smaller decrease in mortality (like 10), this sample size would only have 57 power to detect benefit. therefore the investigators will use an adaptive approach that will allow for a sample_size re_estimation at the interim analysis when 75 of the sample has been recruited. the sample_size re_estimation will be conducted by the dsmb if the effect size observed in the interim analysis is between 10 and 15 absolute reduction in mortality. a smaller effect size would turn achieving adequate sample size unfeasible, whereas a larger effect size will provide the study with more than 90 power to detect the effect. all analyses will be based on the intention_to_treat principle. the investigators will assess the effect of peripheral perfusion_targeted resuscitation (group a) compared to lactate_targeted resuscitation (group b) on the primary outcome through hazard ratio with 95 of confidence interval (ci) and kaplan_meier curve comparison (using log_rank test). binary secondary outcomes will be compared through relative risks, 95cis, and chi_square tests. results for continuous outcomes with normal distribution will be expressed as mean difference, 95ci, and p_value calculated by the t_test. continuous outcomes with asymmetrical distribution will be assessed by the wilcoxon test.",509,1.0
513,nct,"effects of lavender oil on postoperative pain, sleep quality and mood",2017,,cn-01562932,"background significance: essential oils have been formally documented in use since the time of the egyptians. the ebers papyrus document notes egyptians using frankincense for different physical ailments. in greece hippocrates used essential oils to fumigate the city of athens to fight off the plague. in medieval periods lavender essential oil was used for its antidepressive, anxiolytic, sedative, and analgesic properties. medieval persian physicians made records of their treatment plans which included lavender for depression and pain for headaches. with the invention of steam distillation to separate the essential oil from the plant europe began to use oils in perfumes and for medicinal benefits in the 1500s. two physicians named hieronymus and brunschwig wrote one of the earliest printed books on the distillation and use of essential oils for medical benefits. by the 19th century a french chemist rene_ maurice gattefosse was known for studying essential oils and their therapeutic benefits. his work and documentation led the way for the support of essential oil in medical ailments. robert tisserand in the early 1990s reviewed the french chemists work and added to his research to help make essential oils more known to the public in present day. in recent years lavender has been studied on human subjects to tests its known reputation for sedative, anxiolytic, and analgesic properties. in one clinical trial oral administration of lavender was compared to ativan 0.5mg for generalized anxiety disorder. the study supported that the oral lavender oil called silexan was as effective as 0.5mg of ativan in adults with generalized anxiety disorder. a second clinical trial analyzing sleep quality found that ischemic heart patients in the intensive care unit received better sleep with 100 lavender oil undiluted placed on a cotton ball within 20cm from the patient from the hours of 9pm_6am. two studies have used lavender oil through inhalation in the recovery room with an oxygen mask after surgery for pain control. the first study was patients after breast biopsy, the second was patients who just had laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. the study with the breast biopsy patients showed a higher satisfaction rate with pain. the patients undergoing laparoscopic banding also showed a higher rate of satisfaction with pain as well as decreased opioid use in the recovery room. furthermore one study used 100 lavender oil undiluted on the skin of pediatric patients undergoing tonsillectomy as a topical application and asked the patients to inhale. the study showed a decrease use in tylenol usage postoperatively. design procedures: study interventions: blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation will be monitored in the preoperative area before lavender is given and 30 minutes after it is given. the level of pain will also be asked prior to application and at the second set of vitals. the control group will get two sets of vital measurements and pain scale measurements without any intervention. the same vitals will be recorded while the patient is under anesthesia every 30 minutes. there will be a notation in the chart when lavender is given to correlate time from application to time of vitals recorded. a review of the electronic medical record will be done to record amount of narcotic needed interop in both groups. data analysis statistical considerations: study design/endpoints: the primary outcome will be a difference in pain scores between the 2 groups and/or decrease in narcotic use and/or increased patient satisfaction of pain control. design randomized study with control group and test group. using a 1:1 treatment allocation ratio, the total of 40 patients (20 per arm) will be randomly assigned to control or treatment arm. the statistical investigator will generate the randomization scheme and monitor the randomization process over the course of the trial. the study will use randomization with random permuted blocks. the test group will receive 50 lavender oil diluted in fractionated coconut o l and the control group will have the current standard of care with no essential oil intervention. fractionated coconut oil is being used because it is colorless, odorless, does not stain clothing, and has a long shelf life. it also serves as a carrier oil for the essential oil to absorb into the skin instead of evaporating off the skin due to essential oils volatile nature. study procedure the lavender essential oil used will be from the company doterra. this essential oil company was chosen because this company has a medical and science governing board made up of physicians, surgeons, chemists and pharmacists. the oil is also third party tested by dr. robert pappas a trusted chemist in the essential oil community for purity and quality. gas chromatography and mass spectrometry are used to ensure purity and no unwanted substances are in the essential oil. doterras essential oils have also already been used in a hospital setting at vanderbilt university hospital in tennessee. doterras essential oils were diffused in the vanderbilt er at the nursing stations. after 3 months of diffusing staff felt less work related stress, less time feeling overwhelmed, and had more energy at work. after informed consent is obtained, exactly 4 drops of 50 lavender solution will be placed on the wrist over the radial artery. the patient will rub her wrists and hands together and then inhale and exhale slowly for one minute. this will occur thirty minutes before being taken to the operating room. the dilution of 50 was chosen after reviewing robert tisserands book on essential oil safety, consulting a local certified aromatherapist, cynthia loving, and consulting dr. david hill, executive vice president and chief medical officer of doterra essential oils. this percent dilution is recommended on skin and is not likely to cause irritation to the skin. repeated insult patch skin testing from doterra has supported this dilution rate to be safe to the skin. furthermore a previous study used 100 lavender oil on children age 5_12 undergoing tonsillectomy with no adverse reactions. the first dose will be given thirty minutes prior to the operating room because it takes 20 minutes for lavender to be absorbed thought the skin and reach peak plasma levels. in the recovery room after the patient is given lavender through the oxygen mask the same vital signs and pain score measurement will be taken 15, 30, and 60 minutes from lavender application. in the control group on arrival to the recovery room the same data points will be measured with the same time intervals with no intervention. the amount of narcotic needed in the recovery room will be taken from the electronic medical record for each group. postoperatively on the floor vital signs as noted above will be recorded every 4 hours. at each 4 hour interval after the vital signs are taken lavender will be applied to the experimental group and no intervention in the control group. one more set of vitals signs will be recorded 45min after application of lavender each time lavender is applied. there will be a review of narcotic use from the electronic medical record from both groups. there will be a notation when lavender was given to correlate lavender application and narcotic use. during surgery the patient will receive 4 drops of 50 solution lavender oil on the temple region over the temporal artery every 2 hours until completion of surgery. this will be applied by the anesthesia team. if the temporal region is not accessible the shoulders or feet will be alternate locations of application. when the patient arrives to the recovery room she will receive lavender oil through an oxygen mask. a 50 solution will be used by placing 4 drops of the lavender solution on the mask and wiping it around the mask with a cotton ball. this delivery method will be used because this was used in a study from new york university medical center studying postoperative pain and no adverse events occurred. when the patient is on the post_operative floor she will receive 50 lavender oil on the wrist every 4 h urs in the same manner as preoperatively from the hours of 6am to 9pm. nightly (9pm_6am), 8 drops of 50 lavender oil will be placed on the cotton ball situated within 20cm of the patient. this method and concentration was chosen after reviewing a study in ischemic heart patients in the intensive care unit. the patients received lavender at bedside on a cotton ball and had statistically significant better sleep quality. the control group will have the current standard of care with no lavender intervention. the anxiety questionnaire will be given preop before the application of lavender and then daily for every post_op day they stay. the questionnaire is called the hospital anxiety and depression scale. the sleep questionnaire will be given in preop before application of lavender and then daily for every post_op day they stay. the sleep questionnaire is called the richard campbell sleep questionnaire. daily starting on postop day 1 the patient will also record their level of satisfaction of pain

516,nct,effects of mechanical ventilation guided by transpulmonary pressure on gas exchange during robotic surgery: a pilot study,2017,,cn-01494177,"introduction laparoscopy and robotic techniques are widespread procedures for pelvic gynecologic, urologic and abdominal surgery often performed in trendelenburg position. furthermore, in order to ameliorate surgical procedures, pneumoperitoneum is applied by inflating carbon dioxide. however, the rise in abdominal pressure following pneumoperitoneum and the head down body position have been shown to impair the respiratory function during the procedure, mainly inducing atelectasis formation in the declive lung regions. consequently, functional residual capacity decreases and the risk of perioperative complications, such as hypoxaemia, rises up, particularly if patients are obese. formation of atelectasis may worsen stress and strain of the alveolar structure. stress, strain and atelectrauma give rise to ventilator_induced lung injury. although the role of ventilator_induced lung injury during general anesthesia is unclear, several investigations have been conducted with the purpose of improving arterial oxygenation and respiratory mechanics during laparoscopy. a ventilator strategy providing positive end_expiratory pressure (peep) has been shown to reduce the diaphragm cranial shift, increasing functional residual capacity and decreasing respiratory system elastance, principally in the obese subjects. furthermore, the application of recruiting maneuver followed by the subsequent application of peep improved oxygenation during laparoscopy. cinnella et al. demonstrated that an open lung strategy, i.e. a ventilation supported by recruiting maneuvers followed by the subsequent application of peep applied after pneumoperitoneum induction, increased transpulmonary pressure and led to alveolar recruitment and improvement of elastance of chest wall and gas exchange. these results are in accordance with finding by talmor et al, evaluating the effect of a mechanical ventilation guided by esophageal pressure in acute lung injury patients. however a comparison between an esophageal pressure piloted mechanical ventilation and a conventional low tidal ventilator strategy with adjunct of peep and recruitment maneuvers according to clinical judgment has never been investigated in patients undergoing robotic gynecologic, abdominal or urologic surgery. aim the investigators aim to compare the conventional ventilation strategy (i.e., with application of peep and recruitment manoeuvre) with a ventilation driven by transpulmonary pressure assessed through an esophageal catheter, in patients undergoing to robotic surgery, with respect to oxygenation, expressed in terms of arterial oxygen tension _ inspired oxygen fraction ratio (pao2/fio2) (primary endpoint), intraoperative respiratory mechanics indexes, number of lung recruitment maneuvers, rate and type of perioperative complications until hospital discharge (additional endpoint). methods patients for this protocol, after informed consent has been obtained, 26 patients will be enrolled in the pilot randomized interventional study, eligible for robotic gynecological, urological and abdominal surgery at maggiore hospital novara italy. 1. the inclusion criteria will be: minimum age 18 years old, asa i_ii. 2. the exclusion criteria are: pre_existing lung and cardiac conditions that may lead to asa ii, contraindications to the positioning of a naso_gastric tube. 1. control group: 13 ventilated patients in volume controlled vt 6_8 ml / kg peep, and fio2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) set for spo2 or to 94, plateau pressure 28 cm h2o. safety criteria in the intervention group in case of spo2 to 94, alveolar recruitment maneuvers will be applied. these measurement will be will be performed at: 9) 1h after recovery from anesthesia (step 8). with the patient awake (i.e.before and after surgery), a lung ultrasound will be carried out to evaluate the degree of ventilation / atelectasis . intervention after the induction of general anesthesia, a naso_gastric tube equipped with gastric and esophageal balloon will be inserted (nutrivent _ seda). the nasogastric tube wi l be positioned and the esophageal balloon will be calibrated according to the findings by mojoli et al. in this phase, all patients will be ventilated a tidal volume (vt) of 6_8 ml / kg, in a volume controlled mode peep (positive end_expiratory pressure) equal to zero and fio2 set to obtain peripheral oxygen saturation (spo2) or to 94 . the respiratory rate will be set to obtain arterial carbon dioxide tension (paco2) values between 35 and 45 mmhg and to ensure a physiological ph. at most, both a mild hypercapnia and a mild acidosis will be allowed. in all the patients radial artery will be cannulated to monitor continuous intra_arterial blood pressure as usual practice, after allen test results positive. the invasive hemodynamic monitoring will be performed through mostcaretm technology. subsequently, pneumoperitoneum will be applied to the patients, and the final position on the surgical table will be guaranteed. at this point, a recruitment maneuver will be applied, i.e., the ventilator is switched to pressure control ventilation, inspiratory time is increased to 50, the peak inspiratory pressure gradient (above peep) is set at 20 cm h2o, and peep is progressively increased to obtain a stepwise increase of peak inspiratory to 30, 35, and 40 cm h2o every three breaths. the final recruiting pressure of 40 cm h2o is applied for six breaths. after recruiting maneuver ventilator is switched to previous ventilation mode. this maneuver is normally used to distend the lungs and prevent atelectasis . then, patients will be randomized into two groups according to a randomization list generated by a dedicated software. clinician, at the surgical table, will open a sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelope to allocate the patient according to the randomization group. a researcher, not involved in the clinical care of the patient, will keep the randomization list. patients will be randomized into: 2. case group: 13 ventilated patients with current volume vt 6_8 ml / kg and in any case with a transpulmonary inspiratory pressure (plinsp) of less than 20 cmh2o and transpulmonary expiratory pressure (plexp) _ fio2, according to predefined criteria. in both groups the respiratory rate will be set to obtain paco2 values between 35 and 45 mmhg and in any case to ensure a physiological ph. in addition, whenever the clinician will deem it appropriate, an alveolar recruitment maneuver will be applied, as previously described, in order to improve the pao2 / fio2 relationship. measurements during the study the following parameters will be recorded: arterial blood gas, respiratory mechanics parameters (airway pressure, tidal volume, transpulmonary pressure, flow, esophageal pressure),peritoneal insufflation pressure. 1) 15 min after induction of anesthesia (step 1) 2) immediately after the positioning of the patient and / or the

patients with a bmi of 30_39.9 kg/m2 will consent to liver biopsy, accept randomization to vsg, participate in lifestyle modification for a one_year period and consent to a paired liver biopsy at 12 months. sixty candidates will be biopsied with 42 randomizations within the first year yielding 19 (including dropouts) participants/group. this should be sufficient to further estimate meaningful differences in liver histology given the estimated weight loss of lifestyle modification with and without vsg and a correlation of percent weight loss and histological score improvement over the short term (12 months). determining the impact of the vsg is essential for expanding the traditional indications for bariatric surgery and thus, broadening the potential impact of this pilot study. participants meeting study entry criteria are randomized with equal probability to one of two study groups: (1) lifestyle modification (lsm) or (2) vertical sleeve gastrectomy (vsg lsm) with iifestyle modification, followed for 12 months. the primary goal for the trial is to determine if we can recruit, randomize, and retain participants to perform invasive and non_invasive measurements of nash and fibrosis, deliver lifestyle modification and demonstrate the safety of vsg. the investigators wish to also understand which of these two interventions is more effective in achieving, 12 months after entry into the trial, a reduction in nas composed of the non_weighted scores: (1) steatosis 0_3 (2) inflammation 0_3 and (3) ballooning 0_2. secondary goals include comparing the two treatment groups for changes in other measured outcomes including mri assessments of intrahepatic triglyceride and liver elasticity and serum markers. as a pilot study, a sample size of 19 in each group should offer significant information as to the difference in nas score reduction between to two groups and achieve adequate power to distinguish clinically significant changes in the primary and secondary outcome measures. these data support the overarching objective i.e. to provide evidence that a larger, longer_term clinical outcomes trial is feasible. a goal is for a longer term follow up for 5 years to assess the durability of treatment effects and treatment differences. the investigators will screen patients by telephone between the ages of 40 and 67 with a self_reported bmi of 30_39.9 kg/m2, a

519,nct,high versus low positive end expiratory pressure with alveolar recruitment maneuver in laparoscopic bariatric surgeries,2018,,cn-01568292,"the use of a alveolar recruitment maneuver(rm) effectively increases end expiratory lung volume and reopens lung atelectasis during anesthesia and reproduces better oxygenation for surgical obese patients .alveolar recruitment maneuver with peep could decreases atelectasis and improved oxygenation in obese surgical patients .this concept indicate that the maintenance of low peep after multiple alveolar recruitment maneuver during anesthesia may improve its benefits without complications. patients will randomly divided by computerized randomization sequence method into two groups (30 patients in each study group): both groups receive volume controlled ventilation, tidal volume was 6_8 ml/kg for predicted body weight. the pbw calculated according to a formula: 50 0.91 _ height (cm)_152.4 for men and 45.5 0.91 _ height (cm) _ 152.4 for women. the respiratory rate was adjusted to keep the etco2 35_40 mmhg. the inspiratory to expiratory ratio (i:e ratio) was 1:2 and the fio2 was 0.40. low peeprm group: patients receive peep of 5cmh2o. recruitment maneuver ( rm) will be done by increasing the peep in stepwise manner. first peep was increased to 10 cmh2o (3 breaths),then to 15 cm h2o (3 breaths).finally, peep was raised to 20 cmh2o (10 breaths).then decreased for 15cmh2o for (3 breaths),10cmh2o for(3 breaths), and finally returned back to original peep 5 cmh2o.the total procedure took 2 min. recruitment will be carried out at the following times: post intubation(t1) , after peritoneal insuflation(t2) ,after desuflation (t3) and before extubation(t4) . the peak airway pressure should not exceed 40cmh2o. high peep group: patients receive throughout ventilation 15 cm h2o peep with maintaining the peak airway pressure below 40 cm h2o. monitoring :after intubation(t1), post_insufflation(t2), after disinflation (t3) and before extubation(t4) for the fillowoing.1__minute volume ,respiratory rate and tidal volume 2_arterial blood gas( pao2, paco2,ph).3_hemodynamics : heart rate and invasive arterial blood pressure.4_calculated dynamic lung compliance by equation: t v/peak airway pressure_ peep .5_calculated driving pressure by equation: pplat_peep.6_calculated dead space ratio (vd/vt) by equation :paco2_etco2)/ paco2. rescue strategies: a) intraoperative hypoxemia (spo292): in both groups ,rescue primarily will be performed by an increase in fio2 by 0.1 till reaching oxygen (100 ) .if failed and hypoxia persist a recruitment maneuver will be carried out with stepwise incremental peep irrespective of the group allocation. the time of the event of hypoxia and its management will be recorded. b) intraoperative hypotension (systolic blood pressure 90 mmhg): 1. abort any recruitment maneuver in low peep rm group. 2. gradual decrease peep by 5 cmh2o in stepwise manner in higher peep group. 3. give 500 ml bolus colloid and correct fluid status with blood transfusion if indicated. 4. noradrenalin infusion as last resort",516,1.0
520,nct,efficacy of a didactic intervention in anticoagulated patients (taope study),2018,,cn-01662645,"background and current status: it has been proved that oral anticoagulant therapy (oat) is effective in preventing situations with high risk of thromboembolic events and in treating them. it significantly decreases ischemic stroke rates as well as their severity and death risk. however it is a therapy with special features, highlighting: doses and response variability, the close therapeutic range, interactions with other drugs and foods, and potentially severe side effects. this fact compels the investigators to make a close monitoring of those patients. an important impact in developing cardioembolic or hemorrhagic events due to a inappropriate coagulation control using vitamin k antagonists (vka), has been described because of control variations around 15 could result in so relevant clinical problems. the main oat indications are deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, embolic conditions prevention in patients suffering from atrial fibrillation or heart prosthetic valve wearers. most common embolic event is ictus, which could lead to an important inability and dependence state, what would associate a significant increase in health resources use and costs. atrial fibrillation (af) is nowadays the pathology which requires most anticoagulant therapy indications. this fact is partially due to the population aging, since there are both incidence and prevalence increases of this arrhythmia, specially in elderly patients. control of patients on oat were performed in hospitals until a few years ago nevertheless, changes in social and healthy contexts besides the expansion in this drugs prescribing joined to primary health care qualification and evolution, the development of coagulation handheld measuring devices and the need to improve patients accessibility, had justified the control decentralization and due to this facts, oat monitoring can be practiced to stable patients on primary care. when the need of receiving anticoagulation has been stablished, this could be implemented basically using heparin or vitamin_k antagonists or coumadin or new direct action oral anticoagulants as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban or edoxaban. the prothrombin time measuring standardization using international normalized ratio (inr) allows the investigators to obtain reliable results in different laboratories. the development of coagulation handheld measuring devices to match inr in capillary blood with high sensitivity and reliability, has made that possible patients on anticoagulant therapy can be controlled on primary care. this allow the investigators a comprehensive approach and control of these patients. educational and behavioural interventions could improve vka anticoagulated patients ability to keep an inr appropriate control using their progresses in knowledge and understanding of the action mechanisms of anticoagulants drugs. a recent research included in cochrane regarding to those interventions notes that education is particularly important to provide information about safety for patients suffering af on oat and let patients to take their own well founded decisions about treatment options and to manage their oat. however, it could be inferred there are not enough evidences to stablish definite conclusions about educational health interventions impact in inr behaviour in patients suffering from af on oat. therefore, in these three research articles recently conducted in spain with patients on vka, it can be observed an inappropriate anticoagulation control. methods: the investigators performed a randomized clinical trial over a period of 12 months. study area: one healthcare area in malaga (spain) where 741.000 inhabitants from rural or urban population are cared for. it is organized in 33 primary care centers and 19 local doctors offices. in the investigators environment, patients who initiate treatment with vka are trained at their hematology units until they get a suitable inr level control. after that, patients are followed and evaluated in primary care. the amount of patients with af on anticoagulation with vka is high, however, inr levels control results are not ideal. on the other hand, it should be noted that these chronic patients use to suffer many other conditions and they usually take a lot of medication which makes improve of education aspects aimed at self care and effective health self_management which is absolutely necessary. selfcare support programs are presented as a tool to accomplish a change in paternalistic method to other one in which citizens could receive more information about their health state (this fact is in accordance with people requests, demonstrated by a rise in the internet consulting about health issues). expert patients programs, in which instructors are patients with chronic conditions similar to those who receive the training and so they could play a role model, occupying a prominent place inside the selfcare educational initiatives set. through the present research the investigators try to show that an organised group educational intervention, conducted by using school for patients method on vka anticoagulated patients is able to improve inappropriate inr levels control. study population: patients on oat program receiving vka presenting inappropriate inr levels control and belonging to four primary care centers. setting the limits and justification of the sample size: total population from the health centers which take part in the study amount to approximately 50.000 inhabitants. step i: if it is taken into account that prevalence of patients on oat is about 1.5 of general population, it can be claimed that target population to initiate the study will be 750 anticoagulated patients. it has been observed in previous researches that at least 33 of these patients would not have an appropriate inr level control. in order to reach an accuracy about 4 in the estimate proportion using a normal asymptotic confidence interval with a correction to finite populations on bilaterally 95 and assuming that expected population is about 33 and population total size is 750, it will be necessary to include 311 experimental units in this study. step ii: if it is accepted an alfa risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.20 in a bilateral contrast between study group and control group, 312 individual will be required (156 in each group) to detect differences equal or higher than 15 between both groups in primary target. it has been estimated a tracking loss rates of 10. it will be assumed as losts those individual impossible to be located, or those who do not accept to take part or those who do not attend to scheduled revisions, in accordance to the study intervention plan, as well as deceases occurring within six months since the intervention. given the relevant impact of the development of cardioembolic or hemorrhagic events due to inappropriate inr control, changes about 15 could have great clinical relevance. variables. operative definition the main variable to assess in this study is time on inr therapeutic levels in the last six months receiving vka treatment. appropriate inr level control will be assessed in two ways: measuring the therapeutic inr values percentages or time percentages in therapeutic values estimated using rosendaal method. it supposes to record the figure of inr value and the date in which the test was carried out. the therapeutic inr values percentages are defined by their acceptable values according to the pathology the patient suffers. it used to be from 2 to 3 if it is about atrial fibrillation or from 2.5 to 3.5 if thromboembolism prevention is carried out after a heart valve surgery has been performed. so, this quantitative variable has to be measured to calculate patients percentage on appropriate range, according to the patient condition. independent variables also called study variables are those which could affect to result variable. the investigators are going to classify them in eight groups to make easier their analysis. sociodemographic: age and gender. somatometry and vital signs: body mass index (bmi), diastolic and systolic blood pressure, and heart rate. cardiovascul r risk factors: smoking habit, diabetes, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia and chronic renal failure. cardiovascular conditions: atrial fibrillation (af), interventional cardiac valve diseases with or without af, ischemic cardiopathy, thromboembolic diseases history (stroke, transient ischemic attack), hemorrhagic stroke, congestive heart failure. blood test: glomerular filtration rates, total cholesterol, hdl and ldl cholesterol and triglycerides. they will be obtained from the last blood test carried out to the patient. use of accompanying medication: total number of drugs, anticoagulant type. consumption of gastric protector. dietary habits: usual consumption of food rich in vitamin k, alcohol consumption. data collecting: all variables detailed previously were collected as long as they were suitable in digital medical history or it could be directly obtained from the patient during the medical interview, without the need of changing health center usual clinical practice, over the 6 months prior to the intervention. first step: patients on oat program enrolled in several primary health centers belonging to a healthcare area of malaga were evaluated at the study moment attending to their clinical characteristics. the measurements obtained from the digital clinical history in the last six months before the beginning of the study were recorded, as well as the rest of variables. second step: once the study of the vka anticoagulation control degree has been performed, patients on inappropriate control were selected. a list of patients with deficient inr control in participant health centers was made. it was considered an inappropriate inr control when the therapeutic inr values percentages was less than 65, using rosendaal method to obtain them. in case of no availability, inr control was considered inappropriate when therapeutic inr values percentage resulted less than 60. in any of the assumptions, the assessment period was at least the last six months.",517,1.0
521,nct,the influence of food matrix delivery system on the bioavailability of vitamin d3,2018,,cn-01918699,"background the current project is a part of the vitamin d fortification with enhanced bioavailability study program (acronym: dfort) which is an interdisciplinary project including research groups from denmark, spain, and the netherlands supported by the danish innovation foundation. the overall aim of dfort is to develop more efficient strategies for vitamin d fortification by studying the influence of the delivery matrix on the bioavailability of vitamin d. dfort is organized into four scientific work packages (wp). the first two wps have aimed to study whether complex formation (nano_encapsulation) of vitamin d with different proteins may enhance the stability of vitamin d (wp 1 lead by prof. daniel otzen, au_inano) and the effect of complex formation in real food systems including investigations on the stability during storage, light_ and heat_exposure (wp 2 lead by associate professor trine kastrup dalsgaard, au_food). wp 12 have shown that vitamin d can be stabilized by complex formation with whey protein and that the encapsulation may cause less oxidative degradation thereby improving the stability of vitamin d in different food systems. in the current study (wp 3 lead by prof. lars rejnmark, au_health), the bioavailability of vitamin d in different food matrices (including complex formation with whey protein) will be studied in humans. biological samples will be collected in wp 3 allowing for metabolomics studies on possible associations between vitamin d supplementation through different food matrices and metabolic phenotype (wp 4 lead by prof. hanne c. bertram, au_food). although most of the total body vitamin d is synthesized in the skin after exposure to uv light (wavelength of 290_315 nm), most individuals require at least some dietary vitamin d to maintain a replete vitamin d status. this is especially true during wintertime. with a latitude of 56n in denmark, there is no endogenous synthesis of vitamin d in the months extending from october to april, which means that the inhabitants have to rely on food sources in order to maintain a replete vitamin d status. cholecalciferol (vitamin d3 d3) is the main dietary source of vitamin d, but it is only present in a limited number of food items (such as fatty fish) making it difficult to achieve the recommended intake of 10 ug d3 per day. vitamin d status may be improved in response to an increased intake of vitamin d in terms of either supplementation with tablets or food fortification. numerous studies have shown increased 25_hydroxy vitamin d (25ohd) levels in response to an increased intake of vitamin d. it is generally assumed that mean 25ohd concentrations increase by 0.7 nmol/l in response to an increased long_term intake of 1 ug vitamin d per day although the relative increase per microgram supplemented may be higher if baseline levels are low. despite this well_known dose_response relationship in groups of people, several studies have documented that the change in serum 25ohd levels in response to vitamin d supplementation varies widely. several reasons may account for the inter_individual variation in response to vitamin d supplementation. in gross terms, the variation may be due to dosing inaccuracies (inconsistencies between claimed and actual values of vitamin d) and variation in bioavailability of vitamin d. co_primary (null_) hypothesis: _ the food matrix by which d3 is delivered does not affect cmax of d3 as determined 10h post_dosing. _ the absorption profile (time_concentration curve in terms of area under the curve from 0h to 12h auc0_12h) does not differ according to the food matrix by which d3 is delivered. secondary (null_)hypotheses _ compared with vitamin d provided as droplets, the absorption of d3 is not enhanced by delivery through each of the tested food matrices (i.e., increased cmax). inconsistencies between claimed and measured values of vitamin d content in vitamin d tablets and food_fortified products may be due to inconsistencies in dose used for fortification or to the instability of the vitamin per se. discrepant results have been reported on the stability of vitamin d in different food matrices and when exposed to different physiochemical hazards. some investigators have reported vitamin d to be unstable whereas others have found it to be remarkable stable when exposed to oxidation, light, and to acid and alkali. only few studies have searched for factors responsible for the inter_individual variation in 25ohd levels in response to vitamin d supplementation. these studies have suggested that body composition (including fat mass content), genetic variants of the vitamin d binding protein (vdbp), and the ratio of serum 24,25_dihydroxy vitamin d (24,25(oh)2d) to 25ohd may contribute to variation in serum 25ohd levels. however, in a recent study only 47 of the variations in the response to vitamin d supplementation could be explained by accounting for factors of known importance to changes in 25ohd levels. in addition to the above_mentioned indices, factors of importance to the intestinal absorption of vitamin d as well as the food matrix by which vitamin d supplementation is provided may contribute to inter_individual variations in 25ohd responses. however, only few studies are available on the bioavailability of vitamin d from different food matrices and the intestinal absorption of vitamin d, including the intraluminal fate, and molecular mechanisms facilitating the absorption are still only partially understood. as vitamin d is a fat_soluble molecule, it has generally been assumed that vitamin d is absorbed in the small intestine by simple passive diffusion with vitamin d being incorporated into the micelle and transported by chylomicrons via lymph veins to the liver. this is in alignment with studies showing an increased risk of low 25ohd levels in patients with fat malabsorption. accordingly, it has been suggested that ingestion of vitamin d with a meal rich in fat may increase the release of bile, allowing an increased incorporation of vitamin d in the bile salt micelle thereby improving the bioavailability of vitamin d. however, discrepant results have been reported, on whether the composition of the food matrices (and its fat content) by which vitamin d is ingested influence its bioavailability. in a randomized, controlled trial by raimundo et al., the mean change in 25ohd levels two weeks after the treatment with a single large oral dose of 50,000 iu d3 was larger, when the meal had at least 15 g of fat compared to a fat_free meal. in contrast, the fat content of the food matrices was not found to influence the time_concentration profile as measured by vitamin d2 levels in plasma 2, 4, 8, 12, 48, and 72 h after ingestion of a single dose of 25,000 iu d2 added to either whole milk, skim milk or dissolved in 0.1 ml corn oil and applied to toast. however, both of these studies are limited by the use of very high (pharmacological) doses of vitamin d, which may override any physiological effects of the composition of the food matrices. _ compared with vitamin d added to juice, the absorption of d3 is not enhanced by whey protein complex_bound d3 (i.e., increased cmax). _ treatments do not affect plasma levels of parathyroid hormone (pth) and ionized calcium. _ the variability to vitamin d supplementation in terms of cmax is lower if vitamin d is complex_bound to whey proteins as compared to the other tested supplementation methods. _ arterial stiffness as assessed by tonometry is not affected by milk intake. materials and methods the treatment sequences are: treatment sequence 1: a b e c d a lack of an effect of the fat content of the food by which vitamin d is ingested is also supported by studies on vitamin d fortification of orange juice. comparing the bioavailability of vitamin d added to orange juice or supplemented as capsules showed a similar increase in 25ohd concentrations in response to 11 weeks of supplementation with 1000 iu vitamin d per day and the increase was significant compared to placebo. the fact that vitamin d may be sufficiently absor ed following a fat_free meal (such as orange juice) may be explained by recent findings on the mechanism by which vitamin d is absorbed. it seems that vitamin d is not only absorbed by simple passive diffusion (by incorporation into the micelle), as cholesterol membrane transporters, such as sr_bi, cd36, or npc1l1, have been shown to be involved in the absorption. differences in expression levels and the existence of functional polymorphisms in the genes encoding these proteins may also contribute to the large inter_individual variation in postprandial responses to vitamin d. only very few studies are available on the time_plasma concentration profile of vitamin d after intake of an oral dose. denker et al. studied the pharmacokinetic profile of vitamin d3 after administration of a single d3 dose of either 2800 or 5600 iu, showing that plasma d3 levels increased steadily after the intake and peaked at 92.3 h with concentrations returning to near baseline values by 72 h. it is unknown whether the food matrix (including complex formation of vitamin d by encapsulation with whey proteins) affects the bioavailability of vitamin d as assessed by the plasma_time concentration profiles and whether this may influence the inter_individual variability in response to vitamin d supplementation. the importance of calcium intake, and especially calcium intake from milk products and tablets (supplements) has been investigated in a number of studies, showing discrepant results. a cochrane meta_analysis has suggested an overall beneficial effect of increased calcium intake from milk products and calcium supplements. however, a recent trial has suggested an increase in blood pressure in the hours following intake of 1000 mg of calcium citrate compared with placebo. it has so far not been investigated whether milk intake causes similar effects on indices of cardiovascular health, including blood pressure and arterial stiffness. aim the overall aim of the study is to investigate the influence of different food matrices (including complex_formation with whey proteins) on the bioavailability of vitamin d, as assessed by maximum concentration profiles (cmax) and the time_concentration curve of d3 in plasma and thereby whether the inter_individual variation in the absorption of vitamin d may depend on delivery system. explanatory hypotheses in order to allow for further investigations on indices of importance to responses to vitamin d supplementation, data will be collected on body composition, genetic polymorphisms, cholesterol status, and habitual dietary habits. study design the study is performed as a multiple cross_over study using a balanced latin_square design. this design allows for each participant to function as her own control thereby counterbalancing risk of an adverse influence on results of the order of treatment or other factors such as effect of period, as well as inter_individual variations attributable to e.g., genetic variations, body weight etc. by randomization, each participant will be allocated to receive all the five treatment regimes in a pre_specified order with a 10_21 days wash_out period in_between each of the treatment arms. treatment

osteoporosis clinic, aarhus university hospital and kept away from other medication and supplementation. sub_investigator is responsible for correct handling and dispensing of vitamin d supplement, as well as securing that the supplement will only be used as described in the protocol and that the participants are instructed to take it correct. procedures for randomization randomization will be done using a computer generate list. treatments will not be blinded for the investigator. in terms of comparing juice with or without whey proteins bound_complexes, a single_blind design will be applied, as participants will not be told which of the treatments they are receiving. each treatment sequence will be allocated to the same number of patients _ e.g. 3 participants will be in treatment sequence 1, 3 in treatment sequence 2 etc. population thirty participants will be recruited from the general background population by direct mailing using a list of randomly selected individuals living in the area of aarhus generated by research services at statens serum institut. the study will be performed during wintertime (november_april). withdrawal and dropout any participant can at any point drop out of the study without any explanation and will not have to go through a final examination. the investigator can withdraw a participant if this seems necessary for the participants safety. dropouts and withdrawals will be noted and explained in the crf. withdrawal will happen in case of one of the following criteria is fulfilled: _ change in vitamin d supplementation _ ionized calcium 1.40 mmol/l _ disease or new medication that will influence the study _ serious adverse effects/symptoms that is expected to be caused by vitamin d supplementation diseases that occur within 7 days of treatments can be a possible cause of participation in the study. sub_investigator can in this time frame be contacted in order to investigate whether it is a cause of the vitamin d supplementation. in case it is, the symptoms or disease will be followed until it is cured or have become chronic. examinations participants will be examined 5 times over a time period of 6 to 12 weeks. at each visit, the participants will arrive fasting before 9am and will stay at the department until blood sampling at 12 hours is taken. hereafter, the participants is free to go home and come back the following day for the 24 hours blood sampling and delivering the urine samples or stay the night at the hospital. during the 12 hours at the department, the participants will get standardized food. basic health information and questionnaires: participants will answer questionnaires regarding their general health as well as dietary habits and sun exposure. biochemistry: blood samples will be collected at different time points (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours). urine samples: urine will be collected in 3 batches at the first day of each dosing i.e., from 0_4 hours, from 4_8 hours and from 8_24 hours. all measurements will be performed when all material from all 30 participants have been collected. bone scans: dual_energy x_ray absorptiometry (dxa) and high_resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (hrpqct): blood pressure measurements and tonometry: blood pressure and measurements of arterial stiffness (tonometry) are performed twice in each participant in relation to treatment regimes c and d. all measurements will be performed when all material from all 30 participants have been collected in order to avoid variation in results. blood samples will be stored in a biobank for a maximum of 15 years after the end of the study. dxa scanning with the hologic qdr discovery scanner. bone mineral density (bmd) will be measured in lumbar spine (l1_l4), femoral neck, and the distal forearm. furthermore, total body composition will be determined, including fat_ and lean_tissue mass. a hrpqct bone scan of the distal radius and tibia will be performed using an xtreme ct_scanner (scanco medical ag, switzerland). this will allow for assessment of volumetric bmd for cortical and trabecular bone, bone structure and geometry (including cortical and trabecular thickness, trabecular separation etc.) and bone strength. on both occasions, measurements are performed in the morning with the participant in the fasting state. after the measurements are performed, the participant will be provided the intervention together with a breakfast meal. after this, the participant will be fasting until next measurement i performed four hours later. office blood pressure (bp) is measured in a sitting position after 5 minutes of rest on the right upper arm using a digital automatic bp monitor. three bp readings will be performed with 2 minutes of rest in_between. the average of the last two measurements is recorded. arterial stiffness and pulse wave velocity (pwv) will be assessed by tonometry using the sphygmocor system (xcel atcor medical, sydney, nsw, australia). for measurements of carotid_to_femoral pwv, an inflated femoral cuff placed on the right upper thigh combined with carotid applanation tonometry will be used. measurements are performed in a quiet room. the participant will be resting for 10 minutes in a supine position prior to test start. brachial bp is measured on the right upper arm and two consecutive bp readings are performed. if bp readings do not differ by 5 mmhg, the last one is recorded. if bp readings differ by 5 mmhg, four bp readings are obtained. the average of the last two measurements is recorded. aix is assessed as the ratio of wave reflection amplitude to central pulse pressure. the mean of two measurements are used in the analyses. carotid_femoral pwv is assessed as the distance travelled divided by the transit time using the direct carotid_to_cuff distance as measured with a non_stretchable tape (infantometer). a minimum of two measurements is performed. if measurements differs 0.5 m/s the average of the two measurements is used for analyses. if pwv differs by 0.5 m/s a third measurement is obtained and the median value is used for analyses. according to general recommendations, the direct carotid_to_cuff distance mean pwv is multiple with 0.8. perspectives the study will provide insight into the bioavailability of vitamin d3 supplementation, including sources of variation. since denmark is a country with low latitude and high prevalence of vitamin d insufficiency and fortification of food items is not common or legislated, this study may lead to way to fortifying food items in denmark.",518,1.0
522,nct,the dna-based lifestyle enhancement trial,2018,,cn-01661027,"cardiovascular disease (cvd) is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, accounting for 17.9 million deaths and the loss of 348 million disability_adjusted life years in 2015 alone. diabetes and obesity are very strong risk factors for cvd. individuals with diabetes and obesity have an 82.75 life_time risk for developing cvd. while treatments do exist for both obesity (e.g. bariatric surgery) and diabetes (e.g. pharmaceutical control of blood sugar levels), these only partially attenuate risk of adverse health outcomes and they do not address prevention and upstream causes of cardiovascular diseases, namely sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy diet. despite the known cardiovascular benefits of regular physical activity and having a balanced diet, it has proven challenging to change health behaviours towards favourable lifestyles. indeed, the prevalence of obesity is increasing in canada as less than 80 of adults follow the current recommendation of 150 minutes of moderate_to_vigorous physical activity per week and approximately less than 60 of adults consume fruits and vegetables 5 or more times a day. the overarching aim of the study is to test the effect of providing personalized genetic information along with diet and exercise plans on adherence to healthy lifestyle habits and cardio_metabolic risk. there is tremendous public interest in genetics and some evidence that providing genetic information can help improve health habits. however, no intervention to date has examined the effect of comprehensive genetic testing using cutting_edge polygenic score (pgs) prediction and an interactive health portal on health behaviours and cardio_metabolic risk. the investigators hypothesize that providing participants with detailed genetic information about genetic determinants of fitness and nutrition traits will help to motivate people to adopt healthy lifestyle habits. the primary objective is to test the effect of providing genetic information and interactive recommendations for diet and exercise on adoption of healthy behaviours. the secondary objective is to evaluate the effects of the personalized health recommendations on cardio_metabolic risk markers, such as dyslipidemia, inflammatory markers, and fasting glucose. the investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial investigating whether personalized lifestyle recommendations including genetic information motivates hamilton health sciences employees to adopt healthy lifestyle changes. study participation will be open to hamilton health sciences employees. recruitment will begin in march 2017. eligible and consenting individuals will be enrolled. enrollment will occur in a staggered fashion. the intervention group will receive (1) a free 3_month goodlife fitness gym membership providing access to any ontario goodlife fitness facility, (2) professional trainer_approved workout plans, (3) dietitian_approved meal plans, and (4) genetic information pertaining to their health and fitness. the control group will also receive a goodlife fitness membership to ensure that all study participants are granted similar ease_of_access to perform physical activities and generic health recommendations (canadian food guide / health canada physical activity recommendations) but will not receive the personalized component of the intervention (workout plans, meal plans or genetic information) until the end of their trial period. participants will be randomized to treatment or control groups using a minimization scheme for adaptive randomization, which will serve to balance age, gender, and ethnicity across groups as participants are enrolled. thus, randomization will be performed in a single_blind fashion wherein the study team is unaware of whom is receiving the intervention or control. all study participants will be monitored over the course of 3 months beginning with their baseline assessment and ending with their 3_month follow_up assessment. at these two timepoints, study participants will be assessed for behavioural (physica activity levels and diet healthiness), fitness markers (blood pressure, resting heart rate, body fat , and other anthropometric measurements) and biological markers (lipids, insulin sensitivity, and inflammation) of cardio_metabolic disease.",519,1.0
523,nct,restrictive or doppler-guided fluid treatment in colorectal surgery,2018,,cn-01663421,"background hypovolemia can cause postoperative complications, circulatory collapse and death, regardless if the cause is blood loss or loss of other fluids. therefore, doctors are giving fluid intravenously to patients undergoing surgery, and often in an amount larger than the measured losses. recent studies, however, have shown that also fluid overload plays a part in complication development after surgery (1_3). it is therefore important to find the optimal fluid treatment for surgical patients. in denmark, approximately 3500 patients are undergoing surgery every year for colorectal cancer, and in addition, operations are performed for benign diseases. however, the complication rate after colorectal surgery remains high (approximately 30). disagreement about which fluid treatment is optimal exist between three schools for fluid therapy: 1. standard fluid therapy which in addition to replacing external fluid loss (blood loss, urine and evaporation) include fluid to replace a third space loss and fluid to counteract low blood pressure (4_5). standard therapy is poorly defined and differ between hospitals. it cause a bodyweight increase by 3_6 kilo (6_7). 2. goal_directed fluid therapy, where volume is given in a bolus injection of a colloid (typically hydroxyethyl starch (hes)) in order to keep the patients stroke volume (sv) at a near maximum level (1). the heart is brought close to maximum performance. in theory, hypovolemia is prevented and oxygen supply to the tissues increased. in the studies available, hes is given on top of standard therapy and goal_directed fluid therapy therefore result in a weight gain not measured in the available studies. 3. restrictive fluid therapy, replace only measurable fluid losses and strive to maintain the patients normal (preoperative) body weight. the hypothesis is that excess fluid cause interstitial edema which may be harmful to the healing of tissue and function. (2,3,8). standard fluid therapy is meaningful if a benefit exists in giving fluid to a possible third space loss and treat the vasodilatation caused by epidural analgesia by volume. however, a recent critical review of the literature poses serious doubts about the existence of a third space loss (9), and no beneficial effect of volume treatment of the vasodilatation caused by epidural analgesia been shown. goal_directed fluid therapy tests the hypothesis that a near maximal stroke volume (sv) during surgery improves tissue oxygen supply, thus preventing the harmful effects of hypovolemia. unfortunately, all studies that have tested goal_directed fluid therapy with esophageal doppler monitoring have chosen to use a not well_defined standard fluid regime as their control group, and in the intervention groups they have chosen to first provide standard fluid therapy and then give a further hes to maximum stroke volume (10_16). in addition, length of hospital stay (los) were the primary endpoint not morbidity or mortality, and patients were not followed after discharge. the results of these studies differ. most studies have shown shorter los in the intervention group, but only 3 of the studies have been blinded (11, 13, 16). some studies have shown a lower complication rate in the intervention groups (12, 13, 16) some studies have not shown a difference in complication rate (10, 14, 15, 17) and some have raised suspicions that the intervention has been harmful, with increased mortality (15, 18). restrictive fluid treatment is based on the following logic: if there is no third space loss, it is pointless to give saline to replace it, and if epidural vasodilatation is not corrected with volume, it is pointless to give fluid to increase bp. the hypothesis is that fluid overload might result in interstitial edema, harmful to tissue healing and cardiovascular function. only a few studies have tested the effect of restrictive fluid treatment on the development of complications following major surgical procedures, but the results have been consistent: restrictive fluid treat ent has reduced the complication rate after elective abdominal surgery (2, 3). purpose to investigate whether perioperative fluid therapy controlled by esophageal doppler monitoring reduces postoperative complications compared to perioperative fluid therapy controlled by measuring external fluid loss and body weight. in addition, to investigate whether patients receiving restrictive fluid therapy develop hypovolemia with reduced sv during surgery. design clinical randomized double_blinded multicenter study, stratified for each center, and for laparoscopic and open surgery. this will result in a simultaneous stratification of combined epidural and general anesthesia (used in open surgery) and general anesthesia alone (as used in laparoscopic surgery). the patients are block randomized with a number of patients in each block unknown to the doctors performing the randomization. several centers are participating to complete the trial within a reasonable time. the patients are following an enhanced recovery program in both arms. material 150 patients undergoing elective colorectal resection will be included. the number was determined using data from complication databases, which shows a postoperative complication rate of approximately 30. 2_ is set at 5 and _ is set at 15, increasing the credibility of a possible negative result. a number of n 67.5 patients in each group was calculated, and inclusion of 75 patients in each group (total 150 patients) was decided. outcome the composite endpoint of mortality and postoperative complications is the primary endpoint. an event is accepted as a complication if it demands clinical treatment and fulfills given diagnostic criteria. based on the following hypotheses subgroup analysis are planned: both hypovolemia and hypervolemia may be harmful to the cardiac function (low oxygen supply and congestion) and cause cardiovascular complications such as: newly developed arrhythmias, ami, pneumonia, pulmonary congestion, newly developed pleural exudation, pulmonary edema or ards. both hypovolemia and hypervolemia may be harmful to tissue healing (low oxygen supply and interstitial edema) and cause complications related to tissue healing and infection: infections of the wound, bursting of the wound (superficial and deep), leakage from the anastomosis and separation of a stoma. in addition, data for physiological changes in hr, bp, sv, hemoglobin concentration, diuresis etc. will be analyzed. method: a trial profile will account for all patients undergoing elective colorectal resections in the inclusion period. i.e. all patients undergoing elective colorectal resections must be consecutively screened for inclusion and asked to participate if no exclusion criteria is met. the information will take place the day before surgery. the information will be based on the written information (see appendix), and will be given in an easily understandable language and in an appropriate manner adapted to the individual. patients are randomized to either restrictive fluid treatment (r group) or fluid treatment to maximum sv (sv group). preoperative fluid treatment: all patients may drink until 2 hours before anesthesia. if supplemental intravenous fluids are needed, it is given in accordance with the loss, i.e.: glucose isotonic (5) replaces insensible perspiration (if diabetes insulin and if needed potassium is added). registration of fluid intake begins at midnight on the day of the operation. perioperative monitoring: standard anesthesia monitoring as recommended by the danish anesthesiological society is used. a catheter in the radial artery monitor the bp and is used for blood sampling. bp and hr are measured at least 3 times before induction of anesthesia and every five minutes during anesthesia. immediately after the induction of anesthesia, all patients have a doppler placed in the esophagus to measure the flow rate in the aorta, thereby calculating the stroke volume (sv). the sv is measured before surgery is started, and every 15 minutes throughout the operation. in the rest ictive group, the doppler measurements are recorded to a black box (see later). anesthesia: routine premedication is given. in open surgery, combined epidural and general anesthesia are used: the epidural catheter is inserted at the th8_th10 level, tested, and a continuous infusion of bupivacaine 0.5 is running until sufficient blockade. general anesthesia is induced with thiopental / propofol, fentanyl and rocuronium (esmerone) for a neuromuscular blockade. anesthesia is maintained with sevoflurane / fentanyl or propofol / remifentanil (ultiva). for laparoscopic surgery, only general anesthesia is used. in case of conversion from laparoscopic to open surgery, an epidural catheter is placed postoperatively. perioperative fluid treatment: if the preoperative fluid intake 500 ml. it is supplemented to 500 ml. with saline in both groups. in addition, saline is given with the medicine. lost blood is replaced volume by volume with hes (voluven ) with an allowance of 500 ml extra. in the sv group, a bolus injection of 200 ml voluven is given until the increase in sv is 10. blinding: only the anesthesiologist know the randomization group and perioperative fluid treatment. it is unknown to the patient and to the project surgeon. as all patients in the study will receive nacl 0.9, voluven , and other iv fluids, and as all patients are monitored with a doppler in the esophagus, effective blinding of the surgeons can be achieved. in order to avoid bias of the anesthesiologist, the sv measurements are recorded to a black box in the restrictive group. postoperative fluid treatment: throughout the rest of the day of the operation, fluid is given to meet the basic needs, i.e. approx. 1000 ml k_na_glucose, k_glucose or glucose 5. the patient is encouraged to drink and eat as soon as it is safe to swallow. nutrition is started as soon as possible (preferably in recovery) with protein drinks. in the surgical department, fluid charts and weight changes, allowing a body weight increase of two kilograms without treatment, monitor fluid treatment. if the weight increases more than two kilogram, furosemide is given to increase the diuresis. the patients body weight is measured in the morning before surgery, and then every morning until discharge or the seventh post_operative day. the same set of scales are used throughout the course. blood tests: venous blood is taken in the morning on the day of the operation and every morning the following 5 days or until the patient is discharged. surgery: patients are operated with either open or laparoscopic technique. antibiotic prophylaxis follows the departments routine. the bowel is not cleansed except for an enema before rectal surgery. postoperative analgesia: in open surgical procedures, continuous, patient_controlled, epidural analgesia is given for a maximum of 4 days. in addition 1 g paracetamol is given x 3_4, and / or ibuprofen 400 mg x 3_4 if there are no contraindications. supplemental morphine p.n. is allowed. nausea is treated with ondansetron, metoclopramide or dhb, depending on the cause of the patients nausea. in case of suspicion of ventricular retention, a ventricular tube is applied for suction. data collection the project doctor or surgeon see the patient every day and evaluates the patients condition, prescribes fluid treatment, and assesses the presence and treatment of any complications. in addition, the patient is visiting the outpatient clinic approximately 30 days postoperatively. any complications after discharge is

524,nct,direct intra-arterial thrombectomy in order to revascularize ais patients with large vessel occlusion efficiently in chinese tertiary hospitals,2018,,cn-01567282,"protocol title: direct intra_arterial thrombectomy in order to revascularize ais patients with large vessel occlusion efficiently in chinese tertiary hospitals: a multicenter randomized clinical trial (direct_mt) rationale: intra_arterial treatment (iat) by means of retrievable stents has been proven safe and effective in patients with acute ischemic stroke (ais) with confirmed large vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation and in whom the procedure can be started within 6 hours from onset. despite recanalization, a considerable proportion of patients do not recover. this can be attributed to potential adverse effects of the intravenous treatment (ivt) prior to iat. these effects could include neurotoxicity, blood brain barrier leakage and thrombus fragmentation through softening of the thrombus. another reason for non_recovery in mrclean was the occurrence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sich) in 7 of patients, which was fatal in 65. sich occurred as often in the intervention as in the control group, suggesting that this complication could not be attributed to the iat, but rather to pre_treatment with ivt. therefore, the investigators hypothesize that direct iat may lead to a 8 absolute increase in good outcome compared to iat preceded by ivt. objective: to assess the effect of direct iat compared to ivt followed by iat, in patients with acute ischemic stroke, caused by a cta_confirmed occlusion of the anterior circulation (ica_t/l, m1, proximal m2) on functional outcome. study design: this is a parallel group, randomized clinical trial of direct iat versus ivt with iat. the trial has observer blind assessment of the primary outcome and of neuro_imaging at baseline and follow up. study population: patients with acute ischemic stroke and a confirmed anterior circulation occlusion by cta. initiation of ivt must be feasible within 4.5 hours from symptom onset. age must be 18 or over and nihss 2 or more. inclusion criteria _ a clinical diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke, _ caused by a large vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation (distal intracranial carotid artery or middle m1/proximal m2) cerebral artery confirmed by cta, _ ct or mri ruling out intracranial hemorrhage, _ eligible for ivt and iat (within 4.5 hours after symptom onset), _ a score of at least 2 on the nih stroke scale, _ age of 18 years or older, _ written informed consent. exclusion criteria _ pre_stroke disability which interferes with the assessment of functional outcome at 90 days, i.e. mrs 2 intervention: the intervention group will undergo immediate iat using a stent retriever, as recommended by the steering committee. the standard care group will receive ivt 0.9 mg/kg with a maximum dose of 90 mg in one hour, followed by iat using a stent retriever. the investigators strive to reduce delays associated with ivt administration to a minimum to adequately assess the effect of ivt itself with iat. main study parameters/outcomes: the primary effect parameter will be the common odds ratio, estimated with ordinal logistic regression, which represents the shift on the full distribution of the modified rankin scale at 3 months. the estimate will be adjusted for the known prognostic variables age, pre_stroke mrs, time from onset to randomization, stroke severity (nihss) and collaterals and adjusted and unadjusted estimates with corresponding 95 confidence intervals will be reported. _ any contra_indication for ivt, according to guidelines of the american heart association, i.e.: _ arterial blood pressure exceeding 185/110 mmhg _ blood glucose less than 2.7 or over 22.2 mmol/l _ cerebral infarction in the previous 6 weeks with residual neurological deficit or signs of recent infarction on neuro_imaging _ serious head trauma in the previous 3 months _ major surgery or serious trauma in the previous 2 weeks _ gastrointestinal or urinary tract hemorrhage in the previous 3 weeks _ previous intracerebral hemorrhage _ use of anticoagulant with inr exceeding 1.7 _ known thrombocyte ount less than 100 x 109/l _ treatment with direct thrombin or factor x inhibitors _ treatment with heparin (aptt exceeds the upper limit of normal value) in the previous 48 hours. secondary outcomes include mortality at 90 days, stroke severity at 24 hours and 5_7 days, recanalization on cta at 24 hours, dichotomous clinical outcome on the mrs and infarct size at 5_7 days. safety outcomes include rate of sich.",521,1.0
525,nct,magnesium sulfate dose in obese patients,2019,,cn-01952943,"magnesium sulfate has been applied in various situations due to actual or potential benefits related to neuroprotection, treatment of eclampsia/pre_eclampsia, arterial hypertension, adrenergic reflex under laryngoscopy/intubation and, shivering, nausea and vomiting, among others. in anesthesia it has been useful as an analgesic adjuvant however, the method to calculate the dose of magnesium sulfate in obese population is unclear. the objective of this project is to compare two methods of dose calculation based either on the real weight or corrected ideal weight. main objective: to determine the optimum strategy to safely and effectively obtain the value of magnesium concentration in the blood of obese population. secondary objectives: to evaluate postoperative analgesia and the pharmacokinetic profile of neuromuscular blocker used in each group. hypothesis: the null hypothesis is that no matter which method we use to calculate the magnesium sulfate dosage, the blood magnesium concentration will be the same. the alternative hypothesis is that magnesium sulfate dosage based on the patients actual weight generates higher concentrations of magnesium than that required for postoperative analgesia, as compared with dosage based on that corrected ideal weight of the patient. trial design: this is a prospective, controlled, randomized and double_blind clinical trial. study setting this study will be conducted at beneficence portuguese society, santos, an academic hospital, in sao paulo, brazil. a sample of 75 participants will be recruited from a population of obese patients scheduled to undergo cholecystectomy or bariatric surgery through laparoscopy. interventions in the first phase of the trial, 10 patients with body mass index 20_30 kg/m_ will be administered magnesium sulphate 40 mg/kg at anesthetic induction. in all patients, blood collection will be conducted before administration of magnesium sulfate, and at 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 minutes after administration of magnesium sulfate. in the second phase of the trial, from among obese patients scheduled to undergo cholecystectomy or bariatric surgery through laparoscopy at our institute, 75 patients will be invited to participate in the trial. participants will be assigned to three groups by electronic randomization process as follow: placebo group (pg) without administration of magnesium sulfate real weight group (rwg) administration of magnesium sulfate at 40 mg/kg of the patients actual weight corrected ideal weight group (cwg) administration of magnesium sulphate at 40 mg/kg of patients corrected ideal weight. the corrected ideal weight will be calculated using the following formulas: before extubation, the patients in both groups will be administered morphine 0,05 mg/kg and dipyrone 30 mg/kg. five minutes after extubation and after each 30 minutes interval, repeat dose of morphine will be administered at pain_score of 3 (0 to 10) of the patient. ideal weight man height (cm) _ 100 woman height (cm) _ 105 corrected ideal weight ideal weight (0,4 x difference between the real and ideal weight) the participants will not be administered any sedative agent before anesthetic induction. at arrival in the operating room, all patients will undergo electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure measurement, pulse oximetry, monitoring of neuromuscular function, and that of the level of consciousness. venous access and hydration will be achieved according to the anesthesiologists judgment. at the time of puncture of the vein, the first 2_ml blood sample will be collected to establish the basal concentration of magnesium in the blood. within 10 min after collection of the blood, dosage will be calculated according to the following chart (figure 1). in all participants, infusion of treatment solution will be performed by a blinded investigator, and ketoprofen 100 mg, clonidine 2 ug/kg, cefazolin 2 g, dexamethasone 4 mg, ranitidine 50 mg and lidocaine 1,5 mg/kg will be administered simultaneously. at the end of infusion participants will unde go pre_oxygenation with 100 o2 for 3 to 5 min, followed by propofol through target controlled infusion with initial target of 4 ug/ml according to marshs pharmacokinetic model, under monitoring for the level of hypnoses. at the time of adequate level of hypnoses, revealed by the hypnoses monitor (sedline brain function monitoring) calibration of the monitor of neuromuscular function (train_of_four _ tof) will be performed subsequently, cisatracurium 0.15 mg/kg will be administered, and target_controlled infusion of remifentanil (mintos pharmacokinetic model) at initial target concentration of 5 ng/ml will be conducted. under hypnoses monitoring, 0.03 mg/kg cisatracurium will be administered if tof 2 is observed or on surgical demand. remifentanil infusion will be conducted according to the patients hemodynamics, such that systolic pressure is maintained within 30 limits from the baseline value, or maximum value of 130 mmhg and minimum value of 90 mmhg are achieved. during the last 20 minutes period of surgery, cisatracurium will be withheld, when possible. at the end of surgery, at tof 2, atropine 20 ug/kg and neostigmine 40 ug/kg will be administered.",522,1.0
526,nct,comparison of the ambu auragain and intersurgical i-gel laryngeal masks in elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy,2019,,cn-02053366,"design: prospective, controlled, randomized study. participants:after approval by the local clinical research ethics committee, all patients scheduled for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy at plato hospital (barcelona) will be screened for participation. patients will be informed about the study and they must provide written consent. the need for orotracheal intubation during surgery will be consider as a study withdrawal criterion. the primary outcome is the oropharyngeal leak pressure (olp). the secondary outcomes are: insertion time, number of attempts, ventilatory airway peak pressure, time and success rates for gastric tube insertion and side effects. sample size has been calculated to detect a significant difference in oropharyngeal leak pressure (olp) between two devices. according to the results of previous studies we assume a mean olp of 29.2 (3.3) cmh2o for the i_gel and of 34 (5) cmh2o for the ambu auragain. in order to detect a difference of 10, assuming a standard deviation of 5 cmh2o for both devices, 44 patients are required per group with a power of 80 and an alpha error of 0.05. to cover against a dropout rate of 10, a total of 98 patients will be recruited. the patients included in the study will be numbered consecutively and assigned to one of the two groups, lma ambu auragain or i_gel, using a computer_generated random number table, by the principal investigator. the individual result will be kept in opaque envelopes. after the recruitment, the day of the procedure, the enrolling investigator will open sealed, opaque envelopes that conceals the group allocation. participants will be blinded to their group allocation. a gastric tube will be inserted via the drain tube. the correct placement of the gastric tube will be confirmed by free movement during insertion and by aspiration of gastric fluid or detection of injected air by epigastric auscultation. oropharyngeal leak pressure (olp) will be measured by closing the expiratory valve of the circle system at a fixed gas flow of 3 litres/min (maximum allowed 40 cmh2o) recording the pressure at which equilibrium has been reached or audible air is leaking. the leak pressure will be recorded before peritoneal insufflation and during pneumoperitoneum. the peritoneal insufflation pressure will be set at 12 mmhg. at the end of surgery, the anaesthesiologist will remove the laryngeal masks when the patients obey commands. the patients will be transferred to the post_anaesthesia care unit (pacu) to be monitored after the surgery. procedures in the operating room intravenous access will be secured and routine monitoring using ecg, non invasive blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, end_tidal carbon dioxide (etco2) and sevoflurane (etsevo) (datex_ohmeda s/5 compact critical care monitor ge healthcare). after pre_oxygenation with 100 oxygen by facemask for 3 min, anaesthesia will be induced with intravenous fentanyl 50 _g/ml (2_g/kg), propofol 1 (2_3 mg/kg) and rocuronio 1 (0,6 mg/kg). we will continue ventilating with 100 oxygen using a facemask at least for 1 min until optimum conditions for laryngeal mask insertion are achieved (loss of eyelash reflex, relaxation of the jaw, immobility and apnoea). anaesthesia will be maintained with sevoflurane 2 in an air_oxygen mixture using a circle system with fresh gas flow of 2 l/min. additional intravenous fentanyl will be administrated as clinically needed during anaesthesia by an increase of 10_20 in blood pressure or heart rate. laryngeal masks size will be determined according to the manufacturers weight_based recommendations and the insertion technique will be according to the recommendations of the instruction manual. after successful insertion, the cuff will be inflated with air until 60 cmh2o intracuff pressure (icp) measured using an ambu airway pressure manometer (ambu, s.l. b_ 81040149, alcala, madrid, spain). a second measurement of intracuff pressure will be performed for surgeries taking over an hour to ensure that the intracuff pressure has not c anged significantly ( 5 cmh2o) since the last calibrated intracuff pressure. an effective airway will be judged by a square wave capnograph trace, bilateral chest auscultation and no audible leak with peak airway pressures at 12 cmh2o or greater during gentle manual ventilation. the device will be connected to the respiratory machine (datex_ohmeda s/5 compact critical care monitor ge healthcare) and patients will be ventilated with a tidal volume of 8 ml/kg, adjusting the respiratory rate to an end tidal co2 of 30_35mmhg. statistical analysis data will be entered into an excel database. all statistical analyses will be conducted using software from the statistical package for the social sciences (spss, version 18.0, chicago, il, usa). the distribution of data will be determined using kolmogorov_ smirnov analysis. the quantitative variables will be summarized with means and standard deviations, or with medians and percentiles p25 and p75 in case of asymmetric distributions, and qualitative variables with frequencies and percentages. to study the relationships between qualitative variables, contingency tables will be made and the chi square or fishers tests will be used. the difference in oropharyngeal leak pressure (olp) between two devices will be analysed by a student _s t_test or the mann_whitney u test in case of non_normal distributions. to compare the incidence of side effects between the groups, the exact fisher test or chi squared tests will be used. significant differences will be quantified with 95 confidence intervals.",523,1.0
527,nct,metformin in alzheimers dementia prevention,2019,,cn-01992077,"study procedures at the level of the participant. 1. screening. we propose a 2_tier approach for screening, including telephone pre_screening followed by in_person screening. telephone screening includes questions about inclusion and exclusion criteria including demographics (age, language), medical history, contraindications to metformin, and medications. at the time of telephone contact for screening, we will conduct the telephone interview for cognitive status (tics) if the potential participant agrees, as was conducted in the metmci study. a score 34 on the tics out of 41 is considered normal cognition. persons with this score will not be invited to participate. only persons that meet inclusion criteria and do not meet exclusion criteria are invited for in_person screening. in_person screening includes consent, in_person anthropometric measurements (height, weight, waist and hip circumference), vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate), ekg, laboratory tests (tsh, rpr, vitamin b12, complete blood count cbc, basic metabolic panel bmp, hepatic panel, lipid panel, and hemoglobin a1c hba1c), and the in person_neuropsychological battery that is used to determine amci. at the time of screening the tester may choose to complete other assessments that would be scheduled for the first visit otherwise, these assessments will be done in the baseline visit. 2. baseline/screening study visit. the baseline study visit will include the following assessments. history includes age, handedness, education, occupation and employment history, past medical history, and all medications utilized, including a judgment as to whether they affect cognition (positively or negatively). referral source is also documented. psychiatric history, current and past history of depression, current anxiety, alcohol and other substance use, head injury, hypertension, cardiac disease, thyroid disease, other major medical conditions, and surgery are evaluated at screening. a full medical history will be obtained only at screening. any report of events, or side effects will prompt a full history and physical exam at any visit. physical exam will be conducted at screening, with particular emphasis on signs of congestive heart failure, pulmonary, liver, or renal disease for contraindications to metformin, and neurologic examination for the presence of neurologic diseases. vital signs including blood pressure and heart rate will also be ascertained. standing height will be measured using a stadiometer calibrated in cm. body weight is measured using a balance beam scale calibrated in kg. with the participant standing, measurements are taken to the nearest 0.1 kg of weight with a balance scale and height without shoes to nearest 0.5 cm, to calculate bmi (weight in k/height in m2). waist circumference (wc) is measured at the level of the umbilicus. hip circumference (hp) is measured at the level of maximal protrusion of the gluteal muscles. resting blood pressure (bp) will be measured using an automated oscillometric device, 3 measurements will be obtained at 1_minute intervals in a seated position after 5 minutes of rest. the average of the 2nd and 3rd measurements will be recorded. neuropsychological battery. for neuropsychological testing verbatim instructions for administration and specific scoring guidelines will be available. all tests are validated in english and spanish. we will use different versions of the tests when available (e.g. different word lists) to account for learning effects. the following is an expanded description of the neuropsychological battery: total recall score of the free and cued selective reminding test (fcsrt). the fcsrt is a 16 item word list with visual and auditory presentation that uses semantic cuing to facilitate encoding and retrieval. the test has a score range of 0 to 48. paragraph recall on the logical memory iia (episodic memory): free recall of 1 short story that consists of 25 bits of information will be elicited immediately after it is read aloud to the subject and again after approxima ely 30_minute delay. the total bits of information from the story that are recalled immediately (maximum score 25) and after the delay interval (maximum score 25) are recorded. the delay score (0_25 story units) will be used in the composite. digit_symbol substitution test: the digit symbol substitution test is a subset from the wais_r. the test consists of 110 small blank squares presented in 7 rows with 1 of 9 numbers (1_9) randomly printed directly above each blank square. a key is printed above the rows of blank squares. the key pairs numbers 1 through 9 with an unfamiliar symbol. the subject must work as fast as possible for 90 seconds. the measure of interest is number of squares filled in correctly within the time limit (maximum raw score 110). mini mental status exam (mmse). the mmse scale evaluates orientation, memory, attention, concentration, naming, repetition, comprehension, and ability to create a sentence and to copy 2 overlapping pentagons. the mmse is scored as the number of correctly completed items with a lower score indicative of poorer performance and greater cognitive impairment. the total score ranges from 0 (worse) to 30 (perfect). trail_making test, part a: this test of visuoperceptual ability, attention and speed consists of 25 circles distributed over a white sheet of 8 1/2 x 11 paper that are numbered. the participant is instructed to connect the circles with a pencil line as quickly as possible all numbers in an ascending order (e.g., 1 to 2 2 to 3 etc). the participants performance is judged in terms of the time (in seconds) required to complete the task and by the number of errors of commission and omission. the time to complete the trial will be the measures of interest. trail_making test, part b: this test of visuoperceptual ability, attention and set_shifting ability consists of 25 circles distributed over a white sheet of 8 1/2 x 11 paper that are either numbered (1 through 13) or contain letters (a through l). the participant is instructed to connect the circles with a pencil line as quickly as possible while alternating between numbers and letters in an ascending order (e.g., a to 1 1 to b b to 2 2 to c). the participants performance is judged in terms of the time (in seconds) required to complete the task and by the number of errors of commission and omission. the time to complete the trial will be the measures of interest. trail_making test, part b is available in multiple forms of equal difficulty for purposes of repeated evaluations. adascog12. this test will be used as part of the core battery and assesses memory, reasoning, naming, orientation, ideational praxis, constructional praxis, spoken language, language comprehension, word finding difficulty, and ability to remember test instructions. the addition of a 10 word delay recall adds sensitivity in amci and yields maximum score of 80. functional abilities: adcs_adl_pi:the adcs_adl_pi was developed in the adcs prevention instruments trial. the subject rates his/her performance of 18 iadl tasks over the past 2 months. questions about use of technology (e.g., computers and cell phones) are included. responses for each iadl include improved iadl performance (fewer errors, faster completion, less need to refer to notes or instructions), no change (as well as usual), various levels of impaired performance, and non_performance. clinical dementia rating (cdr). the cdr is a clinical scale that rates the severity of dementia as absent, questionable, mild, moderate, or severe (cdr score of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, or 3, respectively). the score is based on interviews with the subject and study partner, using a structured interview that assesses 6 domains: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. the ratings of degree of impairment obtained on each of the 6 categories of function are synthesized into 1 global rating of dementia (ranging from 0 to 3), with more refined measure of change available by use of the sum of boxes (cdr_sb). eliability and validity has been established, as has high inter_rater reliability. memory complaint questionnaire (mac_q): the mac_q consists of six items. the first five items relate to specific situations that are frequently reported as troublesome for those with declining memory, and the last item broadly measures overall self_perceived memory decline. cognitive diagnoses. the research physician will complete the national alzheimers coordinating centers (nacc) assessment and uniform data set (uds), which takes 35 minutes and includes detailed medical and family history, and neurological exam, including the unified parkinsons disease rating scale for extrapyramidal signs, psychiatric assessment with the short version of the geriatric depression scale and neuropsychiatric inventory (npi) questions, assessment of vascular risk factors plus the hachinski scale, and a clinical dementia rating (cdr). cognitive diagnosis will be examined for inclusion and exclusion purposes and will also be examined as an exploratory outcome. for cognitive diagnosis transitions (i.e. conversion from mci to dementia), an adjudication panel at the ccmc will conduct monthly consensus meetings or calls. this panel will be comprised of co_investigators luchsinger, goldberg, devanand, manly, and brickman. during the meeting information of all the cognitive, functional and other clinical information of the subjects will be presented, blind to study allocation. evidence of cognitive deficits (based on the neuropsychological scores), evidence of impairment in social or occupational function (as assessed by the functional measures), and evidence of cognitive and social_occupational function decline will be the criteria used for the diagnosis of dementia. 3. randomization. eligible participants will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive either metformin or placebo, using randomly permuted block randomization of size two or four by each site to achieve balance of treatment assignment overall and by site. the distribution of kits of active metformin or placebo were previously described. 4. titration and repeated neuropsychological testing. after participants consent, are deemed eligible, and complete the baseline assessment, they will complete a 30_day titration period in which the metformin dose will be increased from 500 mg a day at randomization in increments of 500 mg every 10 days to a maximum of 2,000 mg a day. the metformin tablets are taken together as a single dose, usually recommended once at night. participants unable to tolerate at least 1,000 mg a day will be excluded from the study. participants will have in person visits every 10 days to check on their metformin tolerance and to conduct repeated neuropsychological testing. during this titration period, participants will have repeated cognitive tests at day 10, 20, and 30 after randomization. 5. baseline brain mri. participants who remain in the study after titration be invited to have a baseline brain mri without contrast. we expect that approximately half of participants will be willing to do mri and will not have contraindications, based on our current experience at columbia. brain magnetic resonance imaging (mri) with 3t magnets will be conducted in 186 participants across all sites. mri sequences will include 3plane gradient echo localizer, 3d mprage t1 (morphological), 3d t2 (morphological), dti 30 direction (anisotropy, mean diffusivity), dti 30 direction (anisotropy, mean diffusivity), pcasl axial(arterial spin labeling/cbf), pcasl axial calibration. acquisition of these sequences will take approximately 50 minutes. 6. monthly and ad_lib follow_up calls, text messages, or mails. we will conduct monthly follow_up calls to inquire about adverse events and issues with metformin tolerance. we will prefer voice calls, but will provide the options to participants of receiving and replying to text messages or emails. we will encourage participants to communicate with the site staff ad_lib in case of contingencies, comments, or questions. we will use the adcs adverse event checklist to monitor adverse events. in this case we will emphasize potential adverse effects of metformin such as gastrointestinal side effects (e.g. diarrhea), and development of contraindications (class iii or iv congestive heart failure, renal insufficiency, hepatic insufficiency). we will also inquire about potential situations in which metformin needs to be held temporarily such as surgery and the administration of intravenous contrast. 7. follow_up visits: we will repeat all clinical (non_brain imaging) assessments at months 6, 12, 18, and 24. the only exception is that we will test tsh and rpr only at baseline. all other laboratory tests will be repeated. pill counts will be conducted to assess compliance with metformin and placebo. in addition, we will administer the adverse events checklist. all remaining study drug or placebo will be retrieved to assess compliance and for disposal. 8. follow_up brain mri. participants who undergo a baseline mri will be invited to have a follow_up brain mri with the same sequences after the completion of the last visit at month 24. the mri will be completed within one month of the last visit.",524,1.0

529,nct,sphenopalatine ganglion block to treat shoulder pain after laparoscopic surgery,2019,,cn-01992146,"purpose of the study the purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the efficacy of sphenopalatine ganglion block (spgb) block to manage shoulder tip pain (stp) after laparoscopic surgery. background the laparoscopic technique has increasingly become a popular approach for many gynecologic, urologic, thoracic, bariatric and general surgical procedures. while laparoscopic surgery results in less postoperative pain than traditional open surgical techniques, it is associated with three distinct types of postoperative pain: incisional, visceral, and shoulder. the pain experienced in the shoulder is referred from irritation of the diaphragm and is referred to as shoulder tip pain (stp) to differentiate it from pain that originates in the shoulder. stp may persist for longer than incisional and visceral pain and may be the most difficult to treat. narcotic and non_narcotic analgesics have only limited success in relieving stp, but none of these reliably eliminates stp, and they may be associated with undesirable systemic side effects. recently the spgb has been described as a means of managing stp (grant 2018). the spgb was originally described more than 100 years ago as a treatment for headache (sluder 1908). since it was first described, the spgb has been touted to relieve many types of pain, primarily of the head, but also pain extending down to the lower back (berger 1986). the spg is located in pterygopalatine fossa adjacent to the sphenopalatine foramen. it is posterior to the middle nasal turbinate and separated from the nasal cavity by as little as 2 mm of mucosa. the proximity of the spg to the nasal cavity facilitates renders it accessible to local anesthetic block. when local anesthetic is applied to the posterior nasopharyngeal mucosa, drug diffuses into the spg and inhibits nerve conduction. the local anesthetic can be administered by injection, via a cotton_tipped applicator, or by simply dripping it into the nose when the patient is positioned with neck extension (barre 1982). study design this will be a randomized controlled trial to treat stp with local anesthetic or placebo in after laparoscopic surgery. the primary outcome variable will be reduction of stp. number of subjects a power analysis was conducted to determine the minimum number of patents required to provide an indication that the spg block will ameliorate stp after laparoscopic surgery. assuming that a decrease in 2 nrs units will be clinically significant, and setting alpha as 0.05 and beta as 0.8, 36 patients per group will be needed, i.e., 76 total. the investigators will recruit 10 more patients to account for dropouts. the investigators are therefore requesting approval to enroll 90 patients in the study.

530,nct,assessment of remifentanil for rapid sequence induction and intubation in full stomach patient compared to muscle relaxant,2019,,cn-01945010,"background: rapid sequence intubation is the reference anaesthetic procedure for patient at risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents (for example emergency procedure, bowel obstruction, obese patients, gastroesophageal reflux ) or difficult airway management. nowadays the use of succinylcholine (celocurine), a neuromuscular blockade with a short duration of action, is recommended in this indication. however, several adverse events are frequently reported, especially anaphylactic reaction, restraining its use for rapid sequence intubation. other adverse effects such as extended neuromuscular block, malignant hyperthermia or severe hyperkaliemia prohibit its use. in this case the use of another neuromuscular blockade, rocuronium (esmeron), is an alternative solution. unfortunately, this other molecule causes as many anaphylactic event as succinylcholine (1 anaphylactic event for 3000 uses) and produce a long duration of neuromuscular block. incidence of anaphylactic reaction is increasing in france and mostly severe reactions. its utilization is therefore reduced to 31 to 55 of crush induction despite the recommendations. remifentanil is an opioid agent with very shorts delay and duration of action. several study have shown similar intubation conditions in planned surgery with the use of remifentanil instead of neuromuscular blockade and less hemodynamic reactions. remifentanil is already approved for anesthetic induction and recognized as an alternative to neuromuscular blockade for the intubation of children. use of remifentanil has shown satisfying intubation conditions for adults but its incidence of major complications compared to succinylcholine remains unknown. study hypothesis: the investigators thus hypothesized that remifentanil is non inferior to neuromuscular blockade in terms of major complications after a crush induction. methods: a multicenter simple blind randomized controlled trial. 11 centers will participate in this project. experimental treatment arm: during anesthetic induction remifentanil will be injected immediately after hypnotic drug through bolus intravenous injection by a peripheral or verified central venous access, at 3 to 4 ug/kg. orotracheal intubation will be performed 30 to 60 seconds later by a graduated anesthesiologist or a resident with 4 validated semesters. control arm treatment: a neuromuscular blockade will be injected right after the hypnotic drug. whether succinylcholine (celocurine) at 1mg/kg or rocuronium (esmeron) at 1mg/kg in a bolus intravenous injection by a peripheral or verified central venous access. orotracheal intubation will be performed after occurring of fasciculations with succinylcholine or 30 to 60 seconds after injection of rocuronium by a graduated anesthesiologist or a resident with 4 validated semesters. objective and judgment criteria: the primary objective is to demonstrate non inferiority of remifentanil compared to neuromuscular blockade in terms of major complications after a crush induction. primary endpoint is the rate of tracheal intubation without major complications as defined by 1/ tracheal intubation with less than 2 laryngoscopies 2/ no aspiration during the 10 minutes after induction 3/ no desaturation under 95 during the 10 minutes after induction 4/ no hypo or hypertension as defined by a median blood pressure50 mmhg or 110 mmhg 5/ no ventricular arrhythmia involving an emergency treatment or cardiac arrest during the 10 minutes after induction 6/ no grade iii or iv anaphylactic reaction after the 10 minutes after induction. statistical analyses: a 80 incidence of intubation without major complication was hypothesized. non inferiority has been set under a superior limit of 7 for the primary endpoint 95 of the proportions difference between intervention and control group. in order to achieve 80 power with a 5 alpha risk, 1150 patients (575 for each arms) are to be included.",527,1.0

bariatric surgery or surgeries that induce malabsorption _ hiv_ or hepatitis infection _ decreased liver or kidney function (before pregnancy) _ history of malignant disorders _ abuse of toxic substances _ use of systemic steroids _ multiple pregnancy treatment and interventions eligible patients are randomized to receive either routine care (control group) or routine care in addition to a chewing gum intervention for five days (beginning with the second study day, i.e. the day after baseline examination): sugar_free, fruit or mint flavoured gum chewed three times daily for 20 minutes before each meal. routine care includes standard dietary and lifestyle advice for 30 minutes following our local recommendations as well as an advice on capillary blood glucose measurement (fasting as well as 1h after starting each meal). capillary blood glucose profiles are re_ evaluated seven days after starting the blood glucose monitoring. study visits will be scheduled at screening (visit 1, where eligible patients were randomized) as well as seven days later (visit 2). randomisation participants will be randomized to either treatment (chewing gum) or control group (routine care) in a 1:1 ratio. the minimisation method pocock 1975 will be used to minimize the imbalance between the groups according to the preconceptional overweight/obesity status with three strata: i. normal weight (i.e. bmi below 25 kg/m2) ii. overweight (bmi 26 _ 30 kg/m2) iii. obesity (bmi and above 30 kg/m2). medical history and baseline examination a broad risk evaluation will be performed in participating females at the initial contact (between 240 and 320 weeks of gestation) including: evaluation of maternal age, parity, history of gdm, detailed family history, ethnicity, preconceptional diseases, use of ovulation drugs, obstetric history. moreover, an evaluation of preconceptional weight and bmi as well as measurement of blood pressure will be performed. assessment of dietary patterns dietary patterns will be assessed at baseline (visit 1) by using a published and validated food_frequency_questionnaire (ffq) proposed by the german robert koch institute haftenberg 2010. it was also previously used for the german degs project (www.degs_studie.de). information from the ffq will be analyzed quantitatively or summarized by eating scores proposed in the literature (such as the healthy eating index 2010 or alternate healthy eating index 2010) reflecting diet quality based on actual guidelines guenther 2013, chiuve 2012. in addition all patients will be advised to conduct a nutritional protocol for seven days. d. end points secondary end points are fasting glucose concentrations and longitudinal changes (i.e. assessment of group by time interactions in fasting and postprandial glucose trajectories) as well as changes in dietary patterns. e. statistical analysis statistical comparison of continuous parameters (e.g. postprandial or fasting glucose concentrations) will be performed by the two_sample t_test or nonparametric the three primary end points of this study are the averages (arithmetic mean values) of five days 1h postprandial capillary blood glucose measurements: after breakfast (primary end point 1), lunch (primary end point 2) and dinner (primary end point 3). sample size with a sample size of n35 subjects per group we are able t detect a mean difference of 8 mg/dl in postprandial glucose levels with a power of 81 and a type 1 error of _0.016 for a two_sided unpaired students t_test, providing a standard deviation of 10 mg/dl in accordance with landon 2009. in order to achieve a 95 coverage probability, the bonferroni correction will be used to adjust for multiple testing (three primary outcomes). considering a drop_out rate of 5 n74 cases are required for this study. a sample size review and adaptation is planned after 50 of the subjects have been investigated. analysis plan categorical variables will be summarized by counts and percentages continuous variables data are summarized by means and standard deviations (sd) or by median and interquartile range in the case of strong deviations from the normal distribution. approaches (e.g. the brunner_munzel test), respectively. an adjustment for demographic variables (such as age) will be performed in case of significant group differences using analysis of covariance (ancova) or by the proportional odds model, if the normality assumption is violated. linear mixed effects models will be used to assess longitudinal changes of parameters of interest (i.e. fasting and postprandial glucose). interaction terms are included in the longitudinal models to assess group differences and variable transformations (e.g. logarithmic or square root transformation) are used if necessary. a two_sided p_value 0.05 is considered statistically significant. using the bonferroni correction for multiple statistical testing (three hypotheses) this results in a 98.33 confidence interval to achieve a 95 simultaneous coverage probability. all analyses will be performed by using the statistic software r and contributing packages r core team 2016.",528,1.0

536,nct,hesperidin and diosmin for treatment of covid-19,2020,,cn-02134028,"research background and rationale at the end of december 2019, pneumonia of unknown origin was detected in the hospitals of wuhan city, china, and reported to the who country office for the first time 1_3. after a few days, the chinese government has confirmed the human_to_human transmission of the new infectious respiratory disease 4. at the end of january 2020, the who declared the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars), caused by a novel coronavirus (sars_cov_2), as an international public health emergency. the disease termed coronavirus 19 (covid_19) rapidly transmitted from china to all over the world and subsequently the who declared it a global pandemic disease. the virulent virus structure is closely related to (sars_cov) strain with a single_stranded positive_sense rna composition5. this pandemic disease is particularly of major importance to the whole world and especially to countries with a heavy population like egypt. there is a critical need for emergent, continuous, and cost_effective health care delivery to infected people. early detection and strategies for prevention of progression of covid_19 would make a major difference for infected patients and would also be economically beneficial for a resource_constrained country. people infected with covid_19 may have no symptoms but still, act as a source of infection to other surrounding persons. the most common clinical manifestations following infection range from mild symptoms of (generalized fatigue, dry cough, low_grade fever, and sore throat) to severe symptoms of (typical severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) and pneumonia)6. although the tremendous scientific research effort is focusing mainly on the use of antiviral drugs, certain drug repurposing, and vaccine production for the treatment of covid_19 patients, there is no specific cure or vaccine for treatment up till now. new drug development is a time_consuming process so that drug repositioning may be the optimum solution to control this pandemic infection. selected drugs hesperidin is a common flavone glycoside found in citrus fruit such as lemons and sweet oranges7, 8. hesperidin has several pharmacological activities such as anti_atherogenic, antihyperlipidemic, antidiabetic, venotonic, cardioprotective, anti_inflammatory, and antihypertensive actions. the anti_inflammatory activity of hesperidin was mainly attributed to its antioxidant defense mechanism and suppression of pro_inflammatory cytokine production7. hesperidin exhibited anti_viral activity against the influenza virus through a significant reduction of virus replication. treatment of infected cells with hesperidin enhanced cell_autonomous immunity via activation and upregulation of p38 and jnk expression which is essential for cell defense mechanisms against influenza virus9. hesperidin has been used as an herbal medicine for a long time. the safety of hesperidin was confirmed by faseb (federation of american societies of experimental biology) upon request of the fda. toxicity studies have confirmed the high safety profile of hesperidin after oral intake. results from oral toxicity studies showed the absence of adverse side effects after oral hesperidin ingestion of more than 2g /kg 10. hesperidin role in prevention and treatment of covid 19 was recently published by our research team in medical hypotheses journal 12. contraindications of (hesperidin and diosmin mixture, daflon) no reported contraindications. interactions of (hesperidin and diosmin mixture, daflon) no sever drug_drug interactions, only moderate and minor interactions _ celiprolol: (moderate drug_drug interaction) hesperidin may reduce the absorption of celiprolol. _ diltiazem: (moderate drug_drug interaction) hesperidin may reduce the absorption of diltiazem. daflon 500 mg is a marketed tablet dosage form containing a micronized flavonoid mixture of 50 mg of hesperidin and 450 mg of diosmin which used as vasoprotective venotonic agent10. this hesperidin mixtur is characterized by its high safety profile. continues oral administration for hesperidin mixture to rats for 13 and 26 weeks, using a very high dose of 35_fold of the daily dosage showed no toxicity with a high ld50 value of more than 3 g/kg body weight. clinical trials used more than 2850 patients treated with the hesperidin mixture for a period of 6 weeks to 1 year showed normal hematological parameters, hepatic and renal functions with no signs of toxicity11. unraveling host cellular receptors used for cellular entry of covid_19 will provide possible lines for attack. cell entry of covid_19 depends on two consecutive steps, firstly binding of the viral spike (s_protein) to host cellular receptors followed by priming of s_protein by cell proteases. recently, researchers showed that covid_19 uses the ace_2 receptor for entry 13 and the serine protease tmprss2 for priming of s_protein. camostat mesylate, a serine protease inhibitor drug blocked virus entry and was used as a covid_19 treatment in japan14. covid_19 binds to the ace_2 receptor through its specific spike_receptor binding domain (rbd) sequence to form the sars_cov_2_rbd_ace_2 complex. the proposed computational activity of 78 anti_viral drugs against the human ace2 receptor was screened using homology modeling. this study showed that hesperidin is the only compound that could target the binding interface between sars_cov_2 spike and ace2 human receptors. based on virtual screening, hesperidin may disrupt the interaction of ace2 with rbd of sars_cov_2 thus block its entry into the lung cells 15. therefore, hesperidin can be used as a promising prophylactic agent against covid_19 infection. host antiviral responses against covid19 infection depend on the activation of both the immune systems and cellular self_defense mechanisms. immunity plays a major role in the protection of the host against viral infection. the occurrence of immune over_response or immune deficiency is responsible for the condition of infected patients becoming critical or severe16. the anti_viral activity of hesperidin against the influenza virus involves its role in the activation of the mitogen_activated protein kinase (mapk) pathway. the mapk host defense cascade contributes to efficiently restraining viral replication, spread, and minimizing tissue damage9. a recent study showed that the interferon_mapk pathway played an important role in the covid_19 immune response16. therefore, hesperidin by its activation to host immunity my help against covid_19 viral replication and hence its progression which will improve the patient outcome. patients infected with covid_19 exhibited what is called cytokine storm which initiated primarily as an inflammatory response and resulted in uncontrolled over_production of soluble markers of inflammation. available evidence showing that cytokine storm, is a major cause for the development of ards. cytokine storm involves the release of various immune_active molecules such as interferons (e.g. ifn_), interleukins (e.g. il_1_, il_2, il_6), chemokines, and tumor necrosis factor_alpha (tnf__ ) 17. _ verapamil: (moderate drug_drug interaction) hesperidin may increase the absorption of verapamil. _ antihypertensive drugs: (moderate drug_drug interaction) hesperidin may lower high blood pressure might cause your blood pressure to go too low. _ anticoagulant / antiplatelet drugs: (moderate drug_drug interaction) hesperidin may slow blood clotting which might increase the chances of bruising and bleeding. _ sedative medications (benzodiazepines) (moderate drug_drug interaction) hesperidin may cause too much sleepiness. hesperidin with its high anti_inflammatory activity inhibited the secretion of pro_inflammatory cytokines such as ifn__ and il_218. besides, hesperidin inhibited il 1_ stimulated inflammatory responses by inhibiting the activation of the nf _b signaling cascade19. it also played a major rule in suppressing the rel ase of inflammatory markers such as (tnf_ and il_6) in type 2 diabetic patients20. therefore, it can be used as adjuvant therapy to control the severe inflammatory reaction against covid_19. activation of coagulation pathways following the immune response to covid_19 infection promotes clot formation. the proposed mechanism of formation of micro thrombosis involves the occurrence of procoagulant_anticoagulant imbalance, platelet activation, and converting fibrinogen to fibrin. disseminated intravascular coagulation predisposes to the development of multiorgan failure especially in severe infected cases21. a prophylactic dose of heparin (with low molecular weight, lmwh) is recommended for protection against venous thromboembolism in covid_19 hospitalized patients21. in this context, it is essential to highlight the role of concomitant administration of hesperidin and diosmin mixture with heparin for protection against thromboembolism. results from previous clinical trials that used daflon 500 mg with lmwh confirmed the significant effect of this combination compared to lmwh alone in preventing the incidence of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. therefore, co_administration of lmwh and daflon 500 mg can significantly inhibit clot formation and prevent disease progression 22. diagnostic criteria the viral research institution in china has conducted preliminary identification of the sars_cov_2 through the classical kochs postulates and observing its morphology through electron microscopy1. so far, the golden clinical diagnosis method of covid_19 is nucleic acid detection in the nasal and throat swab sampling or other respiratory tract samplings by real_time pcr and further confirmed by next_generation sequencing clinical classification of patients patients can be grouped into three categories: asymptomatic, upper respiratory tract infection (urti) when presenting with rhinitis, pharyngitis, or isolated low_grade fever and myalgia, and lower respiratory tract infections (lrti) when presenting with symptoms of pneumonia or bronchitis3. side effects of (hesperidin and diosmin mixture, daflon) like all medicines, daflon 500 mg can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. some cases of commonplace gastrointestinal disorders and neurovegetative disorders (feeling of discomfort) have been described, which do not require stopping the treatment. safety concerns of (hesperidin and diosmin mixture, daflon) daflon 500 mg tablets is possibly safe for most people when taken by mouth for up to 6 months. the safety of using it for a longer period of time is unknown. side effects include stomach pain and upset, diarrhea, and headache. special precautions warnings: _ pregnancy and breast_feeding: hesperidin is possibly safe for pregnant or breast_feeding women when taken by mouth with diosmin. _ bleeding disorder: hesperidin might slow blood clotting and increase the risk of bleeding. in theory, hesperidin might make bleeding disorders worse. _ low blood pressure: hesperidin might lower blood pressure. in theory, taking hesperidin might make blood pressure become too low in people who already have low blood pressure. _ surgery: hesperidin might prolong bleeding. there is concern that hesperidin might increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgical procedures. stop taking hesperidin at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery. research objectives this research proposal was employed as a practical strategy for providing a suitable drug or drug combination for possible treatment of covid_19 infected patients. this drug may help to prevent the progression of respiratory complications. this can be achieved through different goals as following: 1. screening of different drugs related to different pharmacological classes depending on its possible activity against covid_19 virus. 2. providing cost_effective and easy_to_implement treatment strategy for infected patients and/or patients with high risk of developing respiratory failure. 3. finally, this clin cal strategy remains an important goal in improving egyptian health state which can save their life meanwhile save a lot of money. scope of work the scope of

538,nct,sirolimus coated angioplasty versus plain balloon angioplasty,2020,,cn-02125057,"dialysis vascular accesses such as arteriovenous fistula (avf) and arteriovenous grafts (avg) are surgically created vasculatures used for hemodialysis in patients with end_stage renal disease (esrd). a functioning dialysis vascular access is critical to the delivery of life_saving hemodialysis (hd) treatment to these patients. unfortunately, neointimal hyperplasia frequently occurs within the dialysis vascular access, resulting in stenosis, poor flow and thrombosis with loss of function. the durability of both avf and avg are poor, with an almost 50 failure rate after a median lifetime of 3 to 7 years for avf and 12 to 18 months for avg. vascular access failure is the most common reason for hospitalization among hd patients. the global healthcare costs for treating vascular access_related complications amount to usd 18 billion, and in usd 1 billion in the us alone. these figures are set to increase, due to the increase in the prevalence of access interventions and hemodialysis patients globally. singapore has one of the highest esrd rates in the world and the investigators are facing an increasing number of patients with esrd and the majority of the patients opting for hemodialysis as their treatment modality. as such, vascular access_related complication is set to be a major contribution of healthcare cost in our nation. the current gold standard therapy for the treatment of stenosis in dialysis access is plain balloon angioplasty (ba). despite its widespread availability and minimally invasive nature, the mid_ and long_term patency with ba in patients with esrd is poor. the reported average primary patency after ba is around 40_50 at 1 year. multiple repeated angioplasty is required to maintain the patency of the vascular access. hence, there is an urgent clinical need to improve the patency of dialysis vascular access. recently, the use of stents, in particular stent graft, has been shown to be superior to angioplasty for stenosis occurring at the site of venous anastomoses of an avg. the incidence of patency of the treatment area was significantly greater in the stent_graft group than in the balloon_angioplasty group (51 vs. 23, p0.001), as was the incidence of patency of the access circuit (38 vs. 20, p0.008) at 6 months. for cephalic arch stenosis in avf, the use of stent graft has also been shown to be superior to bare metal stent. the 6 month primary patency for stent graft and bare stent was 81.8 and 39.1, respectively. one_year primary patency for stent graft and bare stent was 31.8 and 0.00, respectively (p 0.002). however, the use of stent graft for the management of dialysis vascular access is not without any concern. in particular, re_stenosis can occur within the stented segment (post stent 12_month primary patency is 46), resulting in the need for repeat angioplasty. future stent deployment in the re_stenotic segment may also not be feasible due to the presence of the stent. moreover, the presence of a stent can impede future surgical revision or new access creation within the same vessel. sirolimus coated balloon (scb) is the new generation of drug_eluting balloons available in the market. compared to paclitaxel, sirolimus is cytostatic in its mode of action with a high margin of safety. it has a high transfer rate to the vessel wall and effectively inhibits neointimal hyperplasia in the porcine coronary model. in the coronary artery interventions, preliminary clinical studies using scb have also shown excellent procedural and 6_month patency. recruitment: study procedure: randomisation occurs when all the lesions are treated adequately, defined as less than 25 residual stenosis after standard treatment. post_procedure ultrasound scan: patency definitions are defined based on sir reporting standards (gray et al., 2003): paclitaxel_coated balloon angioplasty (pcba) has also been shown recently to be superior to plain ba in the treatment of stenosis in dialysis vascular access. this is because the very intervention used to treat the underlying steno is by plain ba can induce vascular injury and accelerate intimal hyperplasia, resulting in rapid restenosis and the need for repeated procedures to maintain vessel patency. by releasing paclitaxel, which is an anti_proliferative drug, locally into the vessel wall during balloon contact, it will blunt the acceleration of intimal hyperplasia response, resulting in improved primary patency after angioplasty. additionally, unlike stents, pcba does not leave a permanent structure that may impede future surgical revision. in a small 40 patient pilot study, the primary unassisted patency in the pcba group was significantly better than the plain ba group at 6 (70 versus 25 ) and 12 months (35 versus 5 , p 0.001) respectively. recent randomized control trials have also shown the superiority of pcba over plain balloon angioplasty in the treatment of stenosis in dialysis vascular access. however, concerns had also arisen recently in the use of pcba. in large lower limb studies involving the use of pcba, meta_analysis had revealed an increased risk of death in patients that are treated with pcba or paclitaxel_coated stent. this had led to warning from the united states food and drug administration (fda) and the issue of guidelines from the interventional societies the effectiveness of scb in patients with dialysis access dysfunction has been shown in a small pilot study in the salvage of thrombosed avg and investigators postulate that scb will be a viable option in patients who requires treatment with drug_coated balloon. the investigators aim to conduct a multicenter double_blinded randomized controlled trial to compare the 6 month unassisted patency rate of scb angioplasty versus plain balloon angioplasty in the management of stenosis in arteriovenous fistula. patients with matured avf (in use for more than 1 month) that are dysfunctional and are already scheduled to undergo balloon angioplasty will be considered for the trial. patients will be consented if they fulfill the preliminary eligibility criteria and are agreeable to participate in the study. once all the eligibility criteria are fulfilled, including angiographic criteria assessed on the day of the procedure, the patient is entered into the trial and randomised. patients who are unsuitable for the trial will be treated in the conventional way with pb and considered as screen failure. the avf will be assessed with ultrasound for possible access sites. all patients will undergo a fistulogram which is obtained by injection of contrast. the access site will be left to the discretion of the procedurist. the fistulogram should include the entire dialysis circuit from the arteriovenous anastomosis to the central veins. the suggested approach would include a fistulogram via an 18 gauge cannula inserted into the arterialised vein. when there is no spontaneous reflux of contrast into the artery, reflux opacification of the arteriovenous (av) anastomosis is achieved by injecting contrast during inflation of a blood pressure cuff or a tourniquet around the arm. alternatively, a trans_radial or arterial approach may be used to obtain the fistulogram post_intervention target lesion patency: post_intervention access circuit primary patency: post_intervention access circuit assisted primary patency: based on fistulogram findings, the access site will be placed up to the discretion of the procedurist. if an 18g cannula is used, it may be exchanged for a vascular sheath that is sized appropriately based on the planned balloon sizes). alternatively, the 18g cannula may be removed and a new access site for intervention may be chosen. a new puncture will be performed with the insertion of a vascular sheath (sized appropriately according to planned balloon sizes). two access sites (both antegrade and retrograde) may be needed in certain cases. a trans_radial or arterial approach may also be considered if necessary in the event that opacification of the anastomosis was not earlier achieved even with inflation of a blood pressure cuff around the arm, it will be perfor ed via contrast injection through a catheter in the feeding artery. when there is more than 1 stenosis, all the lesions will be labelled and treated with conventional balloon angioplasty (from the av anastomosis up to, but not including, the subclavian vein). lesions are considered separate if they are separated by a gap of at least 2 cm. the lesion or lesions will be dilated with standard angioplasty that is sized similar to the adjacent reference vessel. inflation time will be at least 1 minute per inflation. the balloon will be inflated to an appropriate inflation pressure as per institution standardised practice to achieve 25 residual stenosis and satisfactory thrill. if there is significant residual stenosis after angioplasty (defined as 25 stenosis), repeat angioplasty with the same standard angioplasty balloon or a larger standard angioplasty balloon may be used at operators discretion. high_pressure angioplasty balloon or cutting balloon may also be used, if necessary, in the event of resistant stenosis. in stenotic segment adjacent to aneurysmal segment, where the percentage of stenosis is difficult to determine, the treated segment should reach at least reach 6mm. patients will be randomised to receive either the sirolimus coated balloon or plain balloon. repeated angioplasty of the stenotic segments that were successfully treated (defined as less than 25 residual stenosis) will be performed using sirolimus coated balloon (for patient randomised into the sirolimus balloon arm) or plain/placebo balloon (for patients randomised into the placebo arm) all participants will receive an ultrasound scan of their avf after their procedure before discharge. the diameter of the vessel at the treated sites will be measured and documented. brachial artery flow and flow within the outflow vein will also be measured and documented interval after intervention until the next re_intervention at or adjacent to the original treatment site or until the access is abandoned. percutaneous or surgical treatments of a new arterial or venous outflow stenosis/occlusion (including access thrombosis) that do not involve or exclude the original lesion from the access circuit are compatible with lesion patency. the creation of new access that incorporates the target lesion into the new access circuit is also compatible with target lesion patency. interval following intervention until the next access thrombosis or repeated intervention. it ends with the treatment of a lesion anywhere within the access circuit, from the arterial inflow to the superior vena cava_right atrial junction. interval after intervention until access thrombosis or surgical intervention that excludes the treated lesion from the access circuit. percutaneous treatments of either restenosis/occlusion of the previously treated lesion or a new arterial or venous outflow stenosis/occlusion (excluding access thrombosis) are compatible with assisted primary patency. post_intervention access circuit secondary patency: interval after intervention until the access is surgically declotted, revised or abandoned. thrombolysis and percutaneous thrombectomy are compatible with secondary patency. complications will be categorised according to sir definitions of minor or major complications (aruny et al., 2003): a major complication is defined as one that: 1. require therapy, minor hospitalisation ( 48 hours), 2. require major therapy, unplanned increase in the

individuals have a considerable increased risk of cardiovascular disease (cvd), (myocardial infarction, stroke, cv death) and even in the absence of coronary artery disease, an increased risk of heart failure. individuals with prediabetes manifest the same clustering of cardiovascular risk factors (dysglycaemia, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, obesity, physical inactivity, insulin resistance, pro_coagulant state, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation) that confer the high risk for macrovascular complications in type 2 diabetes. for example, 37 and 51 of individuals with prediabetes have hypertension and dyslipidaemia. results of large randomised control trials focusing on diabetes management have shown improvements in cardiovascular and renal outcomes and treatments for patients with established type 2 diabetes. studies examining cardiovascular and renal burdens in patients with prediabetes have demonstrated that the same therapeutic benefits have not been observed in adults with prediabetes. this study focuses on a younger age group considering the aggressive phenotype of young_onset type 2 diabetes as it provides the opportunity to address and effectively manage the associated cardio_metabolic risk factors, prevent progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes and reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease, heart failure and liver_related burden. liver fat predicts both cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes independent of obesity. nafld is a growing clinical problem which has become the most prevalent chronic liver disease in western society. it can be associated with isolated hepatic triglyceride accumulation (steatosis), through steatosis plus hepatocellular damage with inflammation and fibrosis (non_alcoholic steatohepatitis (nash), which may ultimately progress to liver fibrosis/cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. non_alcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) is considered the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome and is commonly associated with insulin_resistant states including obesity, a higher prevalence of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (t2d). nafld has a bi_directional relationship with prediabetes and t2d being a risk factor for non_alcoholic fatty liver disease but conversely, individuals with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes have significantly increased liver fat versus non_diabetic control subjects with a higher risk of nafld than body mass index (bmi) _matched non_diabetic controls. nafld is associated with a metabolic phenotype similar to that observed in t2d: hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance with reduced skeletal muscle glucose uptake and increased non_esterified fatty acid (nefa) release from adipose tissue lipolysis. once liver fat accumulates in the liver, insulin is unable to inhibit glucose and very_low_density lipoprotein (vldl) production resulting in overproduction of glucose and very_low_density lipoprotein (vldl) particles leading to hypertriglyceridaemia and low high_density lipoprotein (hdl)_cholesterol concentrations. nafld is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease with cvd now representing the leading cause of death in nafld. while it remains contentious whether the increased risk of cvd in nafld is explained by the combination of common risk factors shared by both nafld and cvd, most epidemiological studies evaluating cvd risk in nafld suggest the risk occurs independently of associated risk factors. these studies have relied upon biochemical and imaging surrogate markers of nafld (e.g. serum liver enzymes, abdominal ultrasound). using more detailed assessment of nafld e.g. assessment of fibrosis with fibrosis panels, with magnetic resonance imaging (mri) or even biopsy_based. clinical studies have hown that sustained moderate weight loss of around 5_10, achieved through lifestyle intervention lowers blood pressure, improves glucose control, prevents diabetes, and improves dyslipidaemia, as well as improving haemostatic and fibrinolytic factors. the effects of weight reduction on progression to t2d has been studied in pre_diabetes in the diabetes prevention programme study (us) study. a 1 kg of weight loss is associated with a 16 reduction in the progression of pre_diabetes to t2d. metabolic surgery is associated with remission of t2d. there is overwhelming evidence that lcds have a useful role in t2d resulting in substantial weight loss (mean difference in weight vs. controls after 3 months was 7.38 kg (ci: 16.2, 1.5) with high levels of adherence. they can potentially cause profound weight loss of 15_20 of body weight in severe and medically complicated obesity. the weight loss is associated with significant reductions in hepatic and pancreatic fat with associated improvements in insulin sensitivity and pancreatic ss_cell function resulting in remission of t2d in many cases. this dramatic dietary intervention, initially believed to be unmanageable and difficult to maintain, has been demonstrated to be implementable and highly efficacious even when delivered through primary care settings. in one primary care study, using lcd in t2d patients recorded a weight loss of 15kg or more in 24 of patients after 12 months. it is unsurprising that 46 of the participants achieved remission of their t2d. lcd produces bariatric type weight loss and improves glycaemic control in diabetes and results in remission of t2d in the majority of patients, however the impact on complications, remains to be determined particularly in obese people without diabetes. one non_pharmacological strategy to improve cardio_metabolic health in obesity, pre_diabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) includes the application of a low_calorie diet (lcd), utilising reduced daily energy intake (800kcal). to this extent, the purpose of this study is to examine the impact of intensive weight management on metabolic, liver and cardiac health, measures on neuropathy and on appetite regulation. the investigators will study younger (55y) obese people with pre_diabetes and/or metabolic syndrome who exhibit early or pre_clinical evidence of metabolic and cardiovascular complications. the investigators will investigate the effects of a low_calorie diet (lcd) as one of the most effective and least invasive mechanism by which these various factors can be improved.",536,1.0

542,nct,timing of endoscopic intervention for acute variceal hemorrhage: an rct,2021,,cn-02249670,"study design in this trial, we plan to conduct a single_centered, prospective, parallel_group randomized clinical trial. the study protocol observes the standard protocol items rules: recommendations for interventional trials (spirit) 2013. the leader of the sponsoring organization strictly implements oversight of the protocol. we intend to compare the effectiveness of improving re_bleeding rates of cirrhotic patients with avb between the urgent endoscopy and non_urgent endoscopy groups. department of gastroenterology, affiliated jinling hospital, medical school of nanjing university will take full charge of this trial, including recruitment of patients, endoscopic intervention, admission education, in_hospital nursing, subsequent follow_up work, etc. informed consent forms from every patient will be signed before enrollment, and approval from the ethical committees of jinling hospital has been obtained (authorized ethic no. dzqh_kyll_21_01). data processing two investigators in our department are responsible for the data collection and storage. one investigator will inspect the data collected by another one. after finishing the inspection, the data will be input in the off_line database constructed by the investigators. instantly they complete all of the data storage, the two investigators will conduct a double inspection. the eventual data will be used for data analysis. theoretically, there will be no missing data because the investigators will inspect and record every patients data timely. patients with missing data will be excluded from the trial. we will perform source data verification by comparing them with authentic medical records to assess the accuracy, completeness, or representativeness of registry data. patients enrollment an estimated 400 patients will be consecutively included in the study between march 2021 and december 2023. original glasgow_blatchford score is used to evaluate the condition of each patient instead of modified version. the indicators (measured within 2 hours after admission) are blood urea, hemoglobin, systolic blood pressure, pulse, melena, syncope, hepatic disease, and cardiac failure. sample size according to research from ardevol a et al, in the 646 cirrhotic patients with avb performing endoscopy within 6h after admission, the 45_day re_bleeding rate was 26, the results of which was similar to that in another research by ping_hsien chen (the overall 6_week re_bleeding rate for cirrhotic patients with avb was 25.7). then, we hypothesized a difference of 14 would be clinically significant in re_bleeding rate. next, we calculated at least 189 patients in each group would embody the discrepancy (26 vs. 40), with the statistical power of 80 and a two_sided _ level of 5. assuming that a certain number of patients in each group will be lost to follow_up, a minimum of about 200 patients would be necessary for each group. randomization and time set eligible patients are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive endoscopic intervention either within 6h or 6_24h. randomization is conducted by permuted block randomization stratified by age, systolic blood pressure (sbp), and heart rate (hr). the block size is pre_specified, but physicians and investigators are not notified of this during the study. allocation concealment is implemented by the mobile client randomization tool randomization allocation tool (rat). there are two primary sources of patients. the majority of these patients are from the emergency department, and the others are patients with cirrhosis who developed avb during hospitalization. for patients from the emergency department, the interval between admission and receiving gastroenterological consultation will be controlled within 10 minutes by applying the emergency green channel. however, for patients during hospitalization, the time should be calculated as receiving an evaluation by the emergency endoscopic team (gastroenterological consultation). in order to make it easier to record, the time will be uniformly ca culated as receiving gastroenterological consultation, whatever the sources of patients are. the patients will be randomly allocated to undergo urgent endoscopy within 6h or non_urgent endoscopy between 6h and 24h after gastroenterological consultation. the following time data will be recorded: (i) time from presenting with symptoms of acute variceal bleeding to admission (patients from the emergency department) (ii) time from admission to gastroenterological consultation (patients from the emergency department) (iii) time from admission to endoscopy (patients from the emergency department) (iv) time from presentation to gastroenterological consultation (patients develop avb during hospitalization) (v) time from gastroenterological consultation to endoscopy (all of the patients). control of acute bleeding, persistent bleeding, and re_bleeding avb under endoscopy refers to bleed gushing or seeping from esophageal or gastric varices. control of avb refers to persistent bleeding signs that do not occur within 24h after the initial endoscopic intervention. persistent bleeding refers to bleeding that can not be controlled after initial endoscopic intervention within 24h. persistent bleeding is defined as follows (at least one item appears): (i) vomiting of fresh blood or suction of more than 100 ml fresh blood from the nasogastric tube (ii) occurring hemorrhagic shock (iii) review of hemoglobin level decreasing by 30 g/l in the absence of a blood transfusion. re_bleeding refers to recurrent bleeding after control of acute bleeding. the re_bleeding is defined as follows (at least one item appears): (i) hematemesis/melena/hematochezia (ii) with systolic blood pressure dropping by more than 20mmhg from the original level or heart rate increases by 20 beats/min (iii) review of hemoglobin level decreasing by 30 g/l in the absence of a blood transfusion. patients with persistent or re_bleeding will take secondary endoscopic intervention or be transferred to undergo other treatment (surgery or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent_shunt tipss) instantaneously according to the patients condition. treatment (i) before endoscopic intervention: all the patients take uninterrupted intravenous administration of high dose proton pump inhibitors (ppis, 8 mg/h), somatostatin (250 _g/h), and preventive application of antibiotics (ii) initial endoscopic intervention: patients who conform to non_variceal bleeding under endoscopy will not be included in this trial, but the emergency endoscopic team will still strictly follow the procedure to conduct standard treatment for them. for patients conforming to avb, we use tissue adhesive/sclerotherapy/variceal ligation/covered stent as the treatment methods for varicose veins. the patients position is chosen to expose the best field of vision under endoscopy, and the external cannula for endoscopy is used to prevent aspiration according to the patients condition. furthermore, initial endoscopic treatment aim at the varicose vein of the bleeding site solely. after the endoscopic treatment, the patients will be transferred to the gastroenterological care unit (iii) after the initial endoscopic intervention: all the patients are treated with continuous high dose ppis (8 mg/h) and intravenous infusion of somatostatin (250 _g/h) for 72h, with the preventive application of antibiotics for no more than 120h during the follow_up, oral propranolol and ultrasound_guided tissue glue injection therapy could be used as secondary prevention according to the patients condition (iv) the emergency endoscopic team consists of three experienced endoscopists, each with more than ten years of experience in endoscopy and over 500 cases of variceal hemostasis under endoscopy. also, there are several seasoned endoscopic nurses included, who have experience in endoscopic work for more than five years, are proficient in applying endoscopic treatment instruments, and cooperate with endoscopists. follow_up time after randomization, the follow_up work will begin. all the patients ncluded will be followed up to no less than 42 days after control of avb. when patients conditions are stable, further treatment of varicose veins should be decided according to their wishes and statutory agents. patients with good compliance will take standard endoscopic treatment every 3_4 weeks after control of avb or re_bleeding, and the follow_up time should be once a week patients who decline to accept further treatment are followed up only once a week. the follow_up forms could be either by telephone or outpatient review. if the patients are lost to follow_up during the follow_up period, the eventual outpatient review or telephone dates will be treated as the follow_up endpoints. statistical analysis the statistical analyses are performed using sas software, version 9.4 (sas institute). continuous variables are expressed in terms of mean standard deviation. students t_test and wilcoxon rank_sum test are applied to compare normally and non_normally distributed data, respectively. categorical variables are compared employing fishers exact test. the analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint of re_bleeding rate within 42 days between the urgent endoscopy and non_urgent endoscopy groups are performed in the intention_to_treat population. the rates difference and 95 ci of the two groups are calculated with and without the randomization stratification factors. besides, the re_bleeding rates are also estimated using the kaplan_meier method. the log_rank test is used to compare the difference in mortality and re_bleeding rates between the two groups. cox proportional hazards regression model is used to estimate the hazard ratio and 95 ci. a forest plot is employed to analyze risk factors affecting mortality and re_bleeding rates. schoenfeld residual test is applied to verify whether the model meets the proportional risk (ph) hypothesis. the secondary efficacy endpoints are assessed in the per_protocol population. there is no prespecified plan to adjust for multiple comparisons of the secondary efficacy endpoints the analyses for secondary efficacy endpoints should not be used to infer treatment effects. prespecified subgroup analyses include age (40 ys or 40 ys), sbp (100 mmhg or 100 mmhg), hr (120 beats/min or 120 beats/min), hemoglobin (80 g/l or 80 g/l), etc. all the p values are two_tailed, and p 0.05 is considered to be a significant difference.",539,1.0

546,nct,inverse ratio ventilation in neonatal open repair of tracheoesophageal fistula,2021,,cn-02353656,"introduction: maintaining adequate oxygenation after lung retraction and one lung ventilation (olv) in open thoracotomy during neonatal repair of esophageal atresia/ tracheoesophageal fistula is extremely difficult and usually required stopping the procedure and reinflation of the retracted lung which prolong the surgery time, stopping the procedure during critical situations and endanger the fragile neonate from hypoxemia. inverse ratio ventilation has been used originally for long time in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) to improve the oxygenation and lung function. the mechanism with inverse ratio ventilation is to prolong the inspiratory time with reducing the airway pressure and elevate the mean airway pressure preventing the alveoli from collapse. also inverse ratio ventilation (irv) used in many studies in adults during olv with better oxygenation and lung mechanics. despite the standard ventilatory sitting in neonatal anesthesia is to adjust the inspiratory time to achieve inspiratory to expiratory (i:e) ratio of 1:2 to 1:3, but inverse i:e ratio (with inspiratory time longer than expiratory time) up to 4:1 in neonatal mechanical ventilation has been shown to be effective in improving oxygenation, pao2, and gas distribution in atelectatic lungs. inverse i:e ratio in neonatal mechanical ventilation should be used in caution and for a short period of time to avoid possible complications as air trapping/auto peep, volutrauma, air leaks, decrease venous return, and increase pulmonary vascular resistance. aim/ objectives: 1. to compare the incidence of desaturation episodes that needs to stop the procedure and reinflation of the lung using inverse ratio ventilation versus conventional ratio ventilation during one lung ventilation in neonatal open repair of esophageal atresia/tracheoesophageal fistula. 2. to determine the effect of inverse ratio ventilation on hemodynamic parameters, incidence of complications, and length of surgical procedure as compared to conventional ratio ventilation. methodology: the study will

less than 28 days and undergoing open repair of esophageal atresia/ tracheoesophageal fistula with right thoracotomy. all patients will be full term with gestational age 36 weeks and weigh 2.5 kilograms. _ exclusion criteria: significant congenital heart disease including cyanotic heart disease, single ventricle pathology, large intracardiac defect with significant left to right shunt, and severe pulmonary hypertension more than 50 mmhg. other exclusion criteria included prematurity, pneumonia or severe chest infection prior to the surgery, and parent or guardian refusal. _ sampling method based on inspiratory to expiratory (i:e) ratio used in positive pressure ventilation, patients will be randomly and evenly assigned to one of two groups (20 patients each) using a computer_generated list: experimental group irv (inverse ratio ventilation) and control group crv (conventional ratio ventilation). group irv: the i:e ratio in this group will be 2:1 with the maximum inspiratory time (ti) of 1.3 seconds. group crv: the i:e ratio in this group will be 1:2 with the minimum inspiratory time (ti) of 0.4 seconds. _ sample size sample size was calculated using pass 11.0 and based on a study carried out by son et al., 2020. group sample size of 20 patients in group one and 20 patients in group two achieve 82 power to detect a difference between the group proportions of 0.4000. th proportion in group one (the treatment group) is assumed to be 0.1000 under null hypothesis and 0.5000 under the alternative hypothesis. the proportion in group two (the control group) is 0.1000. the test statistic used is the two_sided z test with pooled variance. the significance level of the test was targeted at 0.0500. the significance level actually achieved by this design is 0.0361. the sample size was inflated by 10 to account for attrition problem in prospective studies. _ ethical considerations after acquiring local medical ethics committee approval and informed written consent from the parent or guardian, the investigators will enroll 40 patients in this study. _ study tools and/ or study procedures and/or study interventions all included patients will be admitted to neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) and kept nil per os (npo) after establishing the diagnosis of esophageal atresia/tracheoesophageal fistula, had a secured venous access and received dextrose containing intravenous fluid according to the orders given by the neonatologist. an umbilical artery catheter will be inserted by the neonatologist prior to the surgery, also an orogastric tube (ogt) will be inserted in the proximal esophageal pouch and a low negative pressure suction will be applied to suck any secretions in the esophagus and decrease risk of aspiration. another intravenous (iv) cannula will be inserted after induction of anesthesia and a femoral 22 gauge (g) arterial line will be inserted in any patient without an umbilical artery catheter. after applying standard monitors (non_invasive blood pressure, 5_lead ecg and 2 pulse oximetry one pre_ductal and one post_ductal, 2 temperature probes one oropharyngeal and one axillary), anesthesia induction will be started with inhalational anesthetics sevoflurane 2 in 100 oxygen and increasing gradually till end_tidal sevoflurane reach 4_6 with maintaining spontaneous breathing to avoid gastric distension with positive pressure ventilation (ppv) then tracheal intubation will be facilitated with lidocaine 10 topical spray one puff applied to the glottic opening just before insertion of 3 or 3.5 mm non_cuffed endotracheal tube (ett), then ett will be fixed just above the tracheal carina (confirmed by auscultation _the ett will be initially pushed endobronchial then gradually withdrawn till bilateral breath sound heard_ and absence of gastric distension with gentle positive pressure ventilation). after ensure the correct position of ett just above the carina and below the tracheoesophageal fistula and the patient hemodynamically stable, positive pressure ventilation will be started after establishing muscle relaxation with atracurium 0.5 mg/kg. anesthesia will be maintained with sevoflurane 1_2 in oxygen/air mixture and fentanyl infusion of 1_2 mcg/kg/h. fraction of inspired oxygen (fio2) will be maintained to the lower limit to keep oxygen saturation (spo2) 92 with minimum fio2 of 0.3. iv fluids will be maintained as preoperative rate with boluses of normal saline will be given to replace blood loss and third space loss. blood transfusion will be given in cases lost more than 10 of their total blood volume. all patient will be mechanically ventilated with synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation_pressure controlled ventilation (simv_pcv) mode with the following parameters peak inspiratory pressure (pip) 10_15 cmh2o above positive end_expiratory pressure (peep) of 5 cmh2o to achieve expired tidal volume (vte) from 7_10 ml/kg, respiratory rate (rr) ranging from 30 to 50 breath/minute to achieve end_tidal co2 (etco2) from 30 mmhg up to 50 mmhg, and pressure support (ps) 12 cmh2o. the same pediatric surgery team will perform all procedures. after positioning of the patient in the right lateral position, the right hemithorax will be opened then the right lung will be retracted to expose and ligate the fistula then end to end esophageal anastomosis will be performed. the right lung will be re_inflated under direct vision to ensure full lung ex ansion after finishing of esophageal anastomosis then the right hemithorax will be closed with chest tube in situ. patients in irv group will resumed conventional i:e ratio ventilation after resuming two lungs ventilation. hemodynamic variables including heart rate (hr), mean arterial pressure (map), and oxygen saturation (spo2) will be recorded: baseline (before induction of anesthesia), before initiation of ppv, after the initiation of ppv, after initiation of olv and every 10 min until the end of the procedure. the incidence of hypotension (as the lower limit of normal mean bp on the day of birth, in mmhg, is approximately equal to the gestational age in weeks, so hypotension considered if map is less than the gestational age in weeks) and bradycardia (defined as: hr 90 beats/min, as the lower limit of normal hr in sleeping neonate is 90 beats/min) or hypoxemia (oxygen saturation less than 90) will be recorded. in cases of hypotension, the patient will be treated initially with an iv fluid bolus of 10_20 ml/kg normal saline over 5_10 minutes. in case of estimated blood loss exceeded 10 of tbv, transfusion of packed red blood cells (prbcs) of 10_15 ml ml/kg over 10_20 minutes will be given. if the hypotension persisted despite of volume loading, dopamine iv infusion will be used in dose range 5_10 mcg/kg/min until the blood pressure normalize. bradycardia will be treated initially with stopping the surgery and manual reinflation of right lung if associated with hypoxia and if persisted or not related to hypoxia will be treated with intravenous atropine 0.02 mg/kg. in the case of a drop in oxygen saturation of less than 90, the fio2 and the peep will be increased to 1 and 7 cmh2o respectively, and if desaturation persist, the surgery will be stopped with manual reinflation of right lung. the incidence of stopping the procedure for manual reinflation of the lung will be recorded, also the length of the surgical procedure starting from skin incision till skin closure will be recorded. arterial blood gases (abg) sample will be done two times during the procedure first one after established positive pressure ventilation by 10 minutes and before the surgical incision, the second sample will be done after established olv by 10 minutes but not during desaturation episode. sao2, po2 and pco2, will be recorded. after completion of the procedure, patients will be transferred to the nicu intubated, ventilated and sedated. in the nicu chest x_ray will be performed immediately after patient arrival to exclude pneumothorax. the incidence of complications including desaturation episodes that needs only increase fio2 and/or peep, desaturation episodes that needs stop the procedure with lung reinflation, hypotension, bradycardia, hypercapnia, needs for vasopressor and blood loss exceeding 10 from tbv will be recorded. intraoperative and postoperative data will be collected by the an anesthesia resident not participating in the study. _ statistical analysis numerical data are presented as the mean (standard deviation) or median (range) while categorical data are presented as the number of cases (percentage). between_group comparisons of numerical variables will be performed by the independent sample t_test, or mann_whitney test as appropriate, while those of categorical variables will be performed by the chi_square test. for all tests, a p (probability) value 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. _ statistical package the data collected will be analyzed with statistical program spss (version 22.0 chicago, illinois, usa).",543,1.0

549,nct,randomized controlled trial of digital twin precision treatment: a novel whole body digital twin enabled precision treatment for type 2 diabetes,2022,,cn-02358184,"this is a randomized study comparing outcomes of usual care patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (t2d) with patients diagnosed with t2d enrolled onto twin healths tpt system. twin precision treatment (tpt) system utilizes live, exercise and nutrition coaching based on computer algorithm learning to attempt to improve patients overall health and reverse type 2 diabetes (t2d). the tpt system does so by measuring and addressing glucose aberrations associated with meals. using whole body digital twin (wbdt) platform powered by artificial intelligence (ai) and the internet of things (iot) technologies, the whole body digital twin platform captures data on up to 174 health markers, up to 3000 daily data points to provide precision nutrition guidance to the patient that precisely balances 87 essential nutrient factors. the platform captures daily weight using bluetooth scales and captures daily blood pressure, particularly in patients with underlying htn using bluetooth blood pressure measurement. additionally, the whole body digital twin platform captures daily physical activity and sleep data, and provides precision guidance on activity and sleep for the patient to follow. the machine learning algorithm is devised to integrate these multi_dimensional data and accurately predict personalized glucose responses. dietary intake is a central determinant of blood glucose levels, and thus, to achieve optimal glucose levels, it is imperative to make food choices that induce normal postprandial glycemic responses. thus, the platform will suggest the right food to the right participant at the right time. depending on the likes and dislikes of the patient, the whole body digital twin platform will recommend a meal plan that is balanced across macro, micro and biota nutrients to reduce glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity, which helps in ameliorating inflammation, fatty liver and insulin resistance. this precise management of nutrition, activity and sleep ensures that the average blood glucose of the day will be consistently maintained within the optimal range. the intervention will continuously offer precision nutrition, precision sleep and precision activity recommendations. nutritional, activity, and sleep counseling will be provided by trained health coaches through the app and via telephone. in the usual care of type 2 diabetes, glucose_lowering medications are added progressively with lifestyle modification to improve glycemia and optimize glycated hemoglobin values (hba1c) so as to reduce the risk of developing long_term complications. standard of care is to take such a glucose_centric approach to t2d management rather than focusing treatment on the underlying root causes of the disease. it is rare to attempt to target remission of the diabetes process since remission occurs in usual care regimens in only a very small percentage of patients with type 2 diabetes (21). studies that target other metabolic disease states, such as obesity, have been proven to also impact t2d progression and achieve remission states, but these types of approaches are rare in the usual care setting (22). only three therapeutic approaches have been associated with remission of diabetes: 1. bariatric surgery, 2. very low_calorie diet, and 3. ketogenic diet with near elimination of carbohydrate (23). our study attempts to determine if precision nutritional, activity and sleep guidance associated with the whole body digital twin (wbdt) platform and twin precision treatment (tpt) can lead to diabetes remission in a population of patients with t2d.",546,1.0

will be assessed. the estimated number of participants to include is 40. they will be patients with morbid obesity, referred to the endocrinology and nutrition unit from bellvitge university hospital for a weight loss treatment, in many cases prior to a bariatric surgery. to estimate the sample size the following assumptions were made: same number of participants in each group 10 variation in anthropometric and laboratory measurements trial power of 0.85 and alfa error of 5 estimated losses to follow_up: 15. the main component of the intervention is a polyphenol_rich dietary supplement administrated for 12 weeks. lifestyle, dietary, physical activity data and blood and urine samples will be collected in three visits (baseline, week 6 and week 12) faecal samples will be collected in visits baseline and week 12. all participants will follow a hypocaloric diet and will be randomly assigned to either intervention group (ig) or control group (cg) after recruitment, following a simple randomisation procedure. the ig will take the supplement (3 capsules/day), whereas the cg will take a placebo (3 capsules/day). this trial will be carried out following the ethical guidelines of the declaration of helsinki, the principles of the good clinical practice, under the existing legislation. data collected will be kept strictly confidential. any participant will have the right to access, rectification, cancellation and opposition over such data in accordance with the organic law 15/1999, personal data protection. all information will be stored in a data collection notebook, from which the database will be created. all participants will be provided with an information sheet and will have to sign a consent form before the beginning of this trial. any participant will be allowed to abandon the study for any reason: if requested if the suspension is in the medical interest if an incidence is presented as a consequence of the intervention, inacceptable or representing a threat to the participants health if the participant presents any breakthrough disease or other condition that, according to the principal investigator (pi), are relevant to suspend the intervention. data on medical history, lifestyle and sociodemographic characteristics will be collected through participants clinical records and interviews at baseline. the standard hypocaloric diet (1200 kcal) that participants will have to follow for the entire 12 weeks of the study will be explained to each participant on the first visit. on each visit participants will provide a 3_day food record, completed the three days preceding such visits. qualified staff will collect data on dietary habits through a 24_hours dietary recall and will take anthropometric measurements, including height, weight, hip and waist circumference, body composition using an ergonomic measuring tape and a bioimpedance scan. dietary and anthropometric assessment will be performed following the standard procedures from the dietetic and clinical nutrition unit from bellvitge university hospital. programari de calcul nutricional pro 1.0 software, developed by university of barcelona, will be used to assess dietary and

551,nct,a mental health intervention for a community program called the powerobesity,2022,,cn-02494111,"research plan a. significance a.1 rationale the obesity epidemic in the north american population is a growing concern amongst the scientific community. diabetes and cardiovascular disease have been shown to be significantly influenced by obesity. the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) defines obesity as having a body mass index (bmi) greater than or equal to 30 m/kg2, which is determined by a persons height and weight. a recently published systematic analysis of body mass index in 199 countries and territories showed a trending increase in the bmi of individuals in the united states alone from 1980 to 2008, ranking the highest in both male and female bmi ranges for high income countries . the united states also ranked the highest for obesity rates (23.9) in a study analyzing possible correlations between obesity and active transportation in europe, north america, and australia . in addition, a study looking at the overall increasing trend of obesity in america estimated that with the current annual progression of obesity rates in america, that 86.3 of adults will be obese by 2030 . women of non_hispanic african descent are 56.7 obese, while latinas are 44.4 obese . there is a need for affordable health programs that could available to the general population. another program facing the community in the area of study is mental health problems. according to the world health organization, depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide and a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease . this accumulating problem leads many towards dysfunction, decreased efficiency, loss in quality health, increased addictive behaviors, and even suicide. also, studies show that major depression and alcohol dependence were associated with heavy cigarette use and poor smoking_treatment outcomes . in their study the investigators demonstrated that programs that improve overall health can also improve mental health , . a facilitated lifestyle_based program like the complete health improvement program (chip) has been shown to help lose weight, lower their risks of heart disease and mental health . through a balanced approach, program participants are instructed on how to make healthier food choices, incorporate regular physical activity into their daily lives, learn stress management techniques, and stop using tobacco (if applicable). a.2 can a lifestyle education program work for mental health and obesity community education programs that deal with the root causes of the problems are very effective in changing behavior and improving overall health . some of the root issues with obesity and mental health. the program focuses on improving lifestyle of participants. these are some of the lifestyle interventions that will be used and their effectiveness. healthy diet healthy lifestyles involve eating a balanced diet, maintaining a healthy weight, working out regularly, being low to moderately stressed, not smoking, and limiting alcohol consumption. a healthy diet has been proven to lower the risk of heart disease. the mediterranean diet, for instance, has been shown to lower heart disease risk by up to 70 compared to dieting alone . in addition, nearly half of the money americans spend on food is spent at fast_food restaurants, which is double what was spent in 1955 . fat, sugar, and salt are typically high in restaurant meals, which can contribute to heart disease. found that a healthy diet contains a balance of essential nutrients, calories, carbohydrates, fats, and protein, which reduces the risk of heart disease . reducing body weight an additional contributor to these diseases is obesity. the effects of obesity on cardiovascular disease and diabetes have been well documented. obese individuals are at risk for a variety of health issues, including high cholesterol, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and stroke . coronary heart disease, also known as coronary artery disease, is one of the deadliest health issues associated with obesity. the national institutes of health (nih) repo ts that your arteries can become narrow as a result of fat, cholesterol, and calcium building up and forming plaque in your arteries . angina, shortness of breath, and arrhythmia are some of the signs and symptoms of coronary heart disease. _ exercise 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per week can improve cholesterol levels . in the intervention the investigators are proposing, physical activity recommendations serve as guidelines improve overall health. physical activity rates and obesity rates among americans emphasize the importance of focusing on fitness and weight management. the american heart association reports that only 49.1 of american adults met the recommended physical activity standards . the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) data show that 24.1 of american adults did not participate in leisure_time physical activity that same year. compared to 1950, the number of sedentary occupations has increased by 83, while the number of physically active jobs has decreased by 25 , . _ control of stress mental health, obesity and other problems are also associated with stress. a persons heart rate and blood pressure increase when they are faced with a stressful situation . there is also evidence that individuals suffering from anxiety, depression, and anger are more likely to develop heart disease . when examining current american lifestyles, which are characterized by chronic stress, this information can be cause for concern. therefore, americans may be at increased risk for multiple health problems. furthermore, many americans find it difficult to balance work, finances, family life, and time to practice healthy habits . a.3 nutrition therapy dietitians (rds) and nutritionists (rdns) provide food and nutrition education as well as medical nutrition therapy . in both short_ and long_term studies and in both group and individual settings, micronutrient test (mnt) administered by a rd or rdn is associated with significant weight loss both statistically and clinically. dietitian_led individualized visits provide a control for the study. a.4 medical group visits the group visit is not the same as a class or group therapy session and clearly differs from other for_profit models which do not address health disparities directly or mitigate them. these models have been used to conduct group visit programs for a variety of medical conditions in multiple practice settings , . when compared with standard individual medical visits, medical group visits have been shown to be associated with clinically significant improvements in a variety of medical, psychological, and behavioral outcomes , , . medical group and high_risk populations, such as elderly patients , medical group visits have proven to be highly effective methods for improving access to medical care and monitoring complex chronic diseases. the utilization of emergency departments and outpatient services is decreased in patients treated through medical group visits, their quality_of_life increases, and their satisfaction with their care is higher . a.5 gaps in evidence in treating depression depression is usually treated in primary care settings using pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy as mainstays of treatment. most patients with depression are treated by their primary care provider approximately 5 to 10 of all patients at primary care clinics receive depression treatment . in almost 90 of cases, clinicians recommend antidepressant medications alone or in conjunction with psychotherapy to their patients who are diagnosed as suffering from depression . antidepressants are currently the most prescribed class of medication in the u.s. , . such medications as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and other atypical formulations target the dysregulation of neurotransmitters found in depression . chronic illnesses, including depression, can be influenced by lifestyle and environmental factors, which are often overlooked. researchers estimate that up to 80 of chronic iseases, such as heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, are caused by lifestyle choices and environmental factors , . a substantial portion of the variance in susceptibility to chronic diseases can be attributed to lifestyle factors and environmental factors , . poor nutrition, physical inactivity, poor sleep hygiene, unmanaged stress, social isolation, and substance abuse are some examples , . lifestyle medicine focuses on modifying these maladaptive lifestyle behaviors. the american college of lifestyle medicine defines lifestyle medicine as an evidence_based medical practice that promotes health and well_being through evidence_based therapeutic lifestyle modalities . positive lifestyle changes can reduce depression in several ways. the mediterranean diet, which incorporates a higher intake of fruits and vegetables, has been associated with a decreased risk of depression . studies have shown that moderate exercise of 20 minutes per day, 3 times per week can help reduce depression symptoms . sleep hygiene interventions have been shown to reduce depression symptoms without pharmacological interventions . active leisure can contribute to better mental health, especially for those who are unemployed, by increasing their perception of spending their time efficiently and effectively . evidence_based training can help relieve mood disorders such as anxiety and depression , . intimate and supportive relationships with family, friends, or significant others have been shown to be beneficial to mental health . individuals who feel as though their lives have meaning tend to manifest fewer symptoms of depression . a.6 10 hit hypothesis approach to mental health improvement the intervention will focus on identifying risk factors for depression and anxiety and will quantitate the educational component of the intervention delivered by mental health professionals that are currently presenting for 30 min during the monday session to address the root causes as well as to encourage positive lifestyle changes (e.g. sleep, diet, sun exposure, circadian rhythms, and addictions). the previously published hypothesis . the hypothesis proposed by nedley and ramirez identifies triggers, that combined, could cause mental health problems. the 10 groups of triggers are: (1) genetic, (2) developmental, (3) lifestyle, (4) circadian rhythm, (5) addiction, (6) nutrition, (7) toxic, (8) social/complicated grief, (9) medical condition, and (10) frontal lobe. each of these factors will be dealt with in the lifestyle intervention. b. innovation the innovating proposal is to use medical group visit to encourage positive lifestyle changes that not only will have an impact on weight control but also on mental health in which the minorities around the institution will benefit. the control group will be a dietitian led program that provides obesity care for the inner_city population. the investigators will measure depression and anxiety as well as try to identify causes of depression and anxiety to encourage people to do the changes proposed. by the help of this accelerating excellence in translational science (axis) grant the investigators will be able to help the los angeles county (lac)_department of health services (dhs) population. this approach if successful could be replicated to improve obesity and mental health care in a sustainable way that could impact many people. c. approach c.1a martin luther king (mlk) power obesity group visit endocrinologist dr. theodore friedman (pi) and colleagues at the martin luther king jr. multi_service ambulatory care center (mlk macc) the name of the center changed to martin luther king jr. outpatient center (mlk oc) began providing obesity group visits in january 2013. the clinic, named power (preventing obesity with eating right), is open weekly on monday afternoons for about 2 1/2 hours and patients can attend weekly or monthly. in 2014, the investigators changed the format to have english sessions on the 1st, 2nd and 5th mondays and spanish sessions on the 2nd and 4h mondays. university of california, l s angeles (ucla) clinical and translational research institute (ctsi) provided funding to the charles r. drew university (cdu) through a research infrastructure grant, of which cdu is an equal partner. using the preliminary funding, the investigators were able to obtain cdu institutional review boards (irb) approval, set up a database to track patients, hire a part_time coordinator, and increase the number of patients who attended clinics in person and via video conferencing. the investigators were able to set up an infrastructure for the proposed study through the pilot funding, allowing us to start recruiting patients for the pragmatic study immediately following funding. power analysis can also be based on the data collected. our current power group visit at mlk begins with registration, vital signs, and 20 minutes of fitness. in this period, new subjects are informed they are part of an irb_approved study that collects and anonymizes their data. participants in the study are consented by the study coordinator (90 have consented). in a 30_minute overview, dr. friedman or another expert discusses the differences between diet and long_term lifestyle changes focusing on the complications of uncontrolled obesity and the benefits of weight loss, the importance of a plant_based diet, and physical activity. each participant is then given a physical activity prescription, both aerobic and strength training, on a prescription pad. providers from orthopedics, mental health, and dentistry are frequent guest lecturers who discuss how obesity affects their fields. this visit concludes with a lecture by our dietitian using the curriculum. instant recess (which incorporates physical activity breaks into the daily routine to boost health and productivity) is discussed and our dietitian offers a lecture based on the curriculum. during the meeting, individuals are encouraged to ask lots of questions and to discuss their successes and barriers with the physician and with one another. the sessions last about 2 1/2 hours, and surveys indicate that participants are satisfied with the length and duration of the program. each visit follows a standardized format. there are, however, updates to the slides and a variety of topics are discussed so that patients can get new information at subsequent appointments. on october 8, 2013, the spanish language television station univision profiled the obesity group visit program on its front page. the fitness was included in the visit in january 2011 and was highlighted on both the channel abc7 evening news and univision evening news on august 10, 2015. c.1b pilot study the power clinic pilot irb was approved in october 2013, 651 patients consented for that pilot program. most of patients had diabetes or prediabetes. regarding weight lost 30 of them lost at least 8 pounds. 12 lost at least 5 of their weight. those who came more often showed better results. most participants were satisfied with their experience and results. input was taken from the patients, and they wanted the program to continue, the investigators also took many of their comments and improved the program overall. as a result, our preliminary data indicates a solid infrastructure, recruitability, and success. thus, the investigators are in a good position to implement the mental health proposal as soon as it is funded, the investigators only need a cdu irb amendment for its approval. c 1.c mental health component. the mental health component to the intervention will be based on the 10 hit hypothesis. that approach has more than 80 presented abstract in various scientific meetings showing the effectiveness of applying lifestyle interventions , . c.2 study design and approach. the investigators will do a randomization of the participants for the 18 months comparing those seeing a dietitian and those that will be learning about the 10_hit hypothesis. the study will randomize 75 participants with a 3:1 block ratio goal. by increasing the number of participants in the intervention group of the novel approach to mental hea th and to decrease the load of the dietitian led group. participants cant choose which group to belong in order to improve the randomization of the trial. patients cannot be in both arms of the study. the recruitment method will be the same that was used to get the current power obesity group. the investigators will invite patients from obesity group to this sub study. every patient that wants to participate of this mental health component need to consent. both arms of the study are evidenced based the investigators will have minimum risk. if a participant does not want to consent, the investigators will provide them with a list of other options for them to benefit. the group visits, 2 and a half days will be in spanish and 2 and a half group will be in english. each visit 2 _ hours. for the dietician group of the study the intervention will be offered in english and spanish. participants can participate of the program if they want. the investigators will use 12 months of data for the study. los angeles county will benefit from both legs of the study of this cost_effective approach. c.3.a approach of both study arms. the emphasis of the power obesity is to promote healthy behaviors: a) decrease refined foods. b) decreased consumption of simple refined carbohydrates c) decrease sugary beverages d) a goal of 150 min of aerobic exercise and 30 minutes of anaerobic exercise. both groups will be assessed by the: the international physical activity questionnaire (ipaq) which assessed the amount of exercise the participant does. c 3.b composite group visit. it will have all the element of the visit. 1) a lecture by an expert, 2) guided exercise, 3) exercise prescription, delivery of the curriculum outlined by the national diabetes prevention program. the visits will be documented in medical records in a system call orchid. the duration is going to be 2 _ hours. the intervention will be offered in spanish and english. in addition to the usual curriculum the mental health component. the mental health presentation will cover various areas from defining depression and anxiety, to what contributes to it, to who is at risk for these disorders and if recovery is possible. the investigators will have share for 20 minutes an evidenced based mental health component. participants will be encouraged to adequately hydration, listen to more music therapy, begin or continue a good exercise program, and develop a more intentional way of thinking by listing things that they are grateful for. it will also deal with signs and symptoms of anxiety and various lifestyle therapies such as deep breathing, light therapy, exercise, and avoiding pessimistic thinking to combat depression and anxiety. improving brain health through proper nutrition. a whole food, plant_based diet will be encouraged. intake of omega_3 fatty acids will recommend as well as enough tryptophan and other vitamins and minerals from their foods. the persons thinking process on depression and anxiety. the benefits of cognitive behavioral therapy and correct thinking were presented along with various remedies for distorted thinking patterns. addictions will be addressed in the program. various addictions that can lead to depression or anxiety will be dealt with, two of them being alcohol and narcotics. those with severe alcohol or benzodiazepine addictions will be encouraged to see a health professional. the common characteristics of addictions with the need to overcome addictions. the investigators will also deal with principles of cognitive behavioral therapy strategies, dealing with loneliness and grief, overcoming loss, and enhancing the frontal lobe function. an accountability checklist will be used with each participant to complete daily. the checklist include accounting for water intake, omega_3 fatty acid intake, and proper amount of exercise, etc. the participants bring the checklist to every session to show that the tasks in each category were accomplished. the checklist will be utilized to encourage compliance with the things that were taught . c 3.c dietitian led visit this will follow the academy of nutrition and dietetics guidelines . an individualized plan will be presented to each of the participants. it will last 1 hour each appointment will follow up appointment of 30 minutes. the focus will be in evaluating caloric intake, increase physical activity and other behavior changes with the goal of achieving a 10 weight loss from baseline. c 3.d inclusion criteria age 18, bmi more than 30 kg/m2, that want to lose weight. currently eligible or currently able to receive care at the lac_dhs a physician willing to adjust their medications. if patients are taking weight loss medication like orlistat, lorcaserin, and phentermine/topiramate_er, phenetermine, diethylpropion, phendimetrazine and benzphetamine they could enroll if they stop the medication 2 months or more before joining. if they take a weight loss supplement, they need to stop it 3 months before participating. the investigators exclude pregnant participants due to the difficulty of tracking their weight. those with bariatric surgery will be able to enroll if the surgery was 1 year before joining. c 3e recruitment strategy lac_dhs and its community partners will recruit patients primarily. there are four medical centers and 19 clinics in lac_dhs, and many of them have patient_centered medical homes (pcmh) and other primary care clinics. among the community partners is the southside coalition of community health centers, which consists of 8 clinics that can refer patients to lac_dhs for specialty care, including obesity care. in their 15_20_minute visits, primary care providers in lac_dhs usually do not have time to address lifestyle changes for obese patients and may refer them to a dietitian or obesity program (such as the power obesity clinic at mlk oc). with the introduction of econsults (a dhs_wide platform that allows pcps to refer patients to specialists for specialized care, including obesity treatment), lac_dhs has improved communication among providers. within lac_dhs, there are about 200,000 obese patients. all primary providers can arrange a remote consultation with specialists through the econsult portal, where the obesity clinic and study information can be found. the dhs endocrinology work group, in which endocrinologists from all the medical centers meet biweekly to discuss endocrinology issues, is chaired by dr. friedman. an excellent way to disseminate information about the obesity group clinics and the study. moreover, word_of_mouth referrals and advocacy from our patients in the obesity program will also increase. los angeles county department of health services provides care to low_income medicare beneficiaries (covered ca) as well as patients without insurance. in orchid, visits are tracked by a visit charge that is not charged to patients. a high percentage of hispanics and african americans is expected to participate. native americans, pacific islanders, those with substance abuse histories, as well as individuals with mental illnesses and disabilities may be recruited. despite their low representation in the general population, the investigators expect to recruit caucasians. covariant analyses will be conducted on the major ethnic/racial groups. c.3 specific aim 2 study design and approach. the intervention will aim to recruit the 75 participants for the group intervention and 25 participants for the dietitian_led group. with these numbers, our preliminary power analysis suggests there will be a difference in the two groups with an alpha of .05 and 80 power. c 3.a measures for this intervention. the investigators will add 3 tests, in addition to those tests already given at power obesity, to both arms of the study, 9_question patient health questionnaire (pq_9), generalized anxiety disorder scale (gad), and the depression and anxiety assessment test, at 0, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months of intervention. e. expected outcomes although it is difficult to predict weight loss, based on our experience so far, the investigators expect approximately 5 of patie ts to lose over 10 pounds and another 10 to lose over 5 pounds during the course of the program. another 35 should lose between 2_5 of their weight and the remaining 50 should not lose any weight (although their education and lifestyle will likely improve). improved mental health markers are expected, as well as better international physical activity questionnaire (ipaq) scores and the healthy eating index. recruiting/consenting goals are realistic. since lac_dhs will be recruiting from all parts of the region, the recruitment goals are quite attainable. with the assistance of two volunteer students, the investigators recruited 434 patients in 34 months in the past, with ms. duran as the study coordinator dedicating 25 of her time to the project. as a study coordinator, she will recruit student interns. in terms of recruiting participants and completing the study, the investigators do not expect to have any difficulties. one of the strengths of our proposal is the diversity of the participants, but one of its limitations may be the lack of caucasians and middle and upper class participants. in our view, this is only a minor limitation, as most studies under_represent minorities and treatment programs for safety net clinics must be cost_effective and pragmatic. f. sustainability: since the resources of lac_dhs are being used the investigators expect the program to continue improving and even expand once the program finishes. one of our main goals is to published multiple studies in order to inspire others to replicate the model and help many. the investigators plan to do this regardless of the outcomes. g. future direction our study will end up answering many of our baseline questions and at the same time it will be creating new questions to be answered in the future. the study has a potential to be expended with bigger samples and other sites. the results of the study will determine which direction the study will go.",548,1.0

588,"u. pagotto, d. vanuzzo, v. vicennati and r. pasquali",pharmacological therapy of obesity,2008,,cn-01755947,"obesity is reaching epidemic proportions worldwide and it is correlated with various comorbidities, among which the most relevant are diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. obesity management is a modern challenge because of the rapid evolution of unfavorable lifestyles and unfortunately there are no effective treatments applicable to the large majority of obese/overweight people. the current medical attitude is to treat the complications of obesity (e.g. dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases). however, the potential of treating obesity is enormous, bearing in mind that a volitional weight loss of 10 kg is associated with important risk factor improvement: blood pressure _10 mmhg, total cholesterol _10, ldl cholesterol _15, triglycerides _30, fasting glucose _50, hdl cholesterol 8. drug treatment for obesity is an evolving branch of pharmacology, burdened by severe side effects and consequences of the early drugs, withdrawn from the market, and challenged by the lack of long_term data on the effect of medications on obesity_related morbidity and mortality, first of all cardiovascular diseases. in europe three antiobesity drugs are currently licensed: sibutramine, orlistat, and rimonabant important trials with clinical endpoints are ongoing for sibutramine and rimonabant. while waiting for their results, it is convenient to evaluate these drugs for their effects on body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors. sibutramine is a centrally acting serotonin/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor that mainly increases satiety. at the level of brown adipose tissue, sibutramine can also facilitate energy expenditure by increasing thermogenesis. the long_term studies (five) documented a mean differential weight reduction of 4.45 kg for sibutramine vs placebo. considering the principal studies, attrition rate was 43. this drug not only reduces body weight and waist circumference, but it decreases triglycerides and uric acid as well and it increases hdl cholesterol in diabetics it improves glycated hemoglobin. sibutramine has conflicting effects on blood pressure: in some studies there was a minimal decrease, in some others a modest increase. in all the studies this drug increased pulse rate. sibutramine is not recommended in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, or in case of history of cardio_ and cerebrovascular disease. orlistat is a pancreatic lipase inhibitor that reduces fat absorption by partially blocking the hydrolysis of dietary triglycerides. a recent meta_analysis evaluated 22 studies lasting for at least 12 months, in obese patients with a mean body mass index of 36.7 kg/m2, where orlistat was associated with hypocaloric diet or behavioral interventions: the net average weight loss was 2.89 kg (confidence interval 2.27_3.51 kg). considering the principal studies, attrition rate ranged from 33 to 57. orlistat significantly decreases waist circumference, blood pressure, total and ldl cholesterol, but has no effect on hdl and triglycerides. this drug significantly reduced the incidence of diabetes only in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance. the major adverse effects with orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal (fatty and oily stool, fecal urgency, oily spotting, fecal incontinence) and attenuate over time. orlistat should be avoided in patients with chronic malabsorption and cholestasis. rimonabant is a selective antagonist of cannabinoid type 1 receptor. this drug, by inhibiting the overactivation of the endocannabinoid system, produces anorectic stimuli at the central nervous level, but also has effects on the peripheral systems involved in metabolism control, such as liver, adipose tissue, skeletal muscles, endocrine pancreas, and gastrointestinal apparatus, influencing many processes partially unknown. an ample experimental program named rio (rimonabant in obesity) involved about 6600 obese or overweight patients to identify the effects of rimonabant in weight loss and associated cardiometabolic abnormalities, over and eyond a caloric restriction of 600 kcal in the treatment and placebo arms. in the four double_blind rio trials published (rio_north america, rio_europe, rio_lipids, rio_diabetes), rimonabant 20 mg significantly (p 0.001) reduced weight by 6.3_6.9 kg in the non_diabetic groups vs placebo (_1.5_1.8 kg), whereas in the diabetic subjects enrolled in rio_diabetes, weight loss was 5.3 vs 1.4 kg in the placebo group. attrition rate at 1 year ranged between 40 and 50, similar to the studies with sibutramine or orlistat. similarly to weight loss, also waist circumference was significantly reduced by rimonabant. as for cardiometabolic parameters, rimonabant induced a significant increase in hdl cholesterol and a significant decrease in triglycerides. even if no significant ldl reduction was achieved, the rio_lipids study showed a significant decrease in small dense ldl particles, more atherogenic, in rimonabant_treated subjects. non_diabetic treated patients improved basal insulin and indirect indexes of insulin resistance, while in the rio_diabetes study, the only one including diabetics, glycated hemoglobin improved by 0.7 in the active treatment arm vs placebo. the effects on hdl cholesterol and glycated hemoglobin seem in a large percentage unrelated to weight loss. these effects have been confirmed by another trial, named serenade, evaluating the treatment in naive diabetic patients. rimonabant is not recommended in patients with a history of depressive disorders or suicidal ideation and with uncontrolled psychiatric illness, and is contraindicated in patients with ongoing major depression or ongoing antidepressive treatment. in conclusion, despite an enormous advancement in basic research to understand the pathogenetic mechanisms at the base of obesity, the pharmacological research did not reach the therapeutic opportunities available for other chronic conditions, like hypertension and dyslipidemia. however, the few molecules available for clinical practice (sibutramine, orlistat, rimonabant) have shown, when properly used, to contribute to reduce body weight and undoubtedly improve cardiometabolic risk factors. with this preamble, according to current guidelines and pharmacoeconomic studies, patients who might benefit from antiobesity treatment are those with a body mass index

two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for eligibility. inclusion criteria were applied to the full text using a standard form. interventions investigated were open and laparoscopic bariatric surgical procedures in widespread current use compared with one another and with non-surgical interventions. population comprised adult patients with body mass index (bmi) or 30 and young obese people. main outcomes were at least one of the following after at least 12 months follow-up: measures of weight change quality of life (qol) perioperative and postoperative mortality and morbidity change in obesity-related comorbidities cost-effectiveness. studies eligible for inclusion in the systematic review for comparisons of surgery versus surgery were rcts. for comparisons of surgery versus non-surgical procedures eligible studies were rcts, controlled clinical trials and prospective cohort studies (with a control cohort). studies eligible for inclusion in the systematic review of cost-effectiveness were full cost-effectiveness analyses, cost-utility analyses, cost-benefit analyses and cost-consequence analyses. one reviewer performed data extraction, which was checked by two reviewers independently. two reviewers independently applied quality assessment criteria and differences in opinion were resolved at each stage. studies were synthesised through a narrative review with full tabulation of the results of all included studies. in the economic model the analysis was developed for three patient populations, those with bmi or 40 bmi or 30 and 40 with type 2 diabetes at baseline and bmi or 30 and 35. models were applied with assumptions on costs and comorbidity., results: a total of 5386 references were identified of which 26 were included in the clinical effectiveness review: three randomised controlled trials (rcts) and three cohort studies compared surgery with non-surgical interventions and 20 rcts compared different surgical procedures. bariatric surgery was a more effective intervention for weight loss than non-surgical options. in one large cohort study weight loss was still apparent 10 years after surgery, whereas patients receiving conventional treatment had gained weight. some measures of qol improved after surgery, but not others. after surgery statistically fewer people had metabolic syndrome and there was higher remission of type 2 diabetes than in non-surgical groups. in one large cohort study the incidence of three out of six comorbidities assessed 10 years after surgery was significantly reduced compared with conventional therapy. gastric bypass (gbp) was more effective for weight loss than vertical banded gastroplasty (vbg) and adjustable gastric banding (agb). laparoscopic isolated sleeve gastrectomy (lisg) was more effective than agb in one study. gbp and banded gbp led to similar weight loss and results for gbp versus lisg and vbg versus agb were equivocal. all comparisons of open versus laparoscopic surgeries found similar weight losses in each group. comorbidities after surgery improved in all groups, but with no significant differences between different surgical interventions. adverse event reporting varied mortality ranged from none to 10. adverse events from conventional therapy included intolerance to medication, acute cholecystitis and gastrointestin l problems. major adverse events following surgery, some necessitating reoperation, included anastomosis leakage, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, band slippage and band erosion. bariatric surgery was cost-effective in comparison to non-surgical treatment in the reviewed published estimates of cost-effectiveness. however, these estimates are likely to be unreliable and not generalisable because of methodological shortcomings and the modelling assumptions made. therefore a new economic model was developed. surgical management was more costly than non-surgical management in each of the three patient populations analysed, but gave improved outcomes. for morbid obesity, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (icers) (base case) ranged between 2000 pounds and 4000 pounds per qaly gained. they remained within the range regarded as cost-effective from an nhs decision-making perspective when assumptions for deterministic sensitivity analysis were changed. for bmi or 30 and 40, icers were 18,930 pounds at two years and 1397 pounds at 20 years, and for bmi or 30 and 35, icers were 60,754 pounds at two years and 12,763 pounds at 20 years. deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses produced icers which were generally within the range considered cost-effective, particularly at the long twenty year time horizons, although for the bmi 30-35 group some icers were above the acceptable range., conclusions: bariatric surgery appears to be a clinically effective and cost-effective intervention for moderately to severely obese people compared with non-surgical interventions. uncertainties remain and further research is required to provide detailed data on patient qol impact of surgeon experience on outcome late complications leading to reoperation duration of comorbidity remission resource use. good-quality rcts will provide evidence on bariatric surgery for young people and for adults with class i or class ii obesity. new research must report on the resolution and/or

and analysis: two review authors independently assessed the search results for trials to be included in the review. we resolved any discrepancies by third party decision., main results: we identified two completed rcts (enrolling a total of 211 participants and conducted in the uk and us) and two ongoing trials that met the inclusion criteria. both completed trials compared acetazolamide to placebo, in conjunction with a weight loss intervention in both groups. attrition bias was a problem in both trials with high loss to follow-up, in one study this loss to follow-up occurred particularly in the acetazolamide arm. one trial was unmasked and we judged it to be at risk of performance and detection bias. in these studies, change in visual acuity was similar in the treatment and control groups as measured by logmar acuity. in one study people in the acetalomazide group had a similar change in logmar acuity compared to the placebo group between baseline and 12 months in the right eye (md 0.04 logmar, 95 ci -0.08 to 0.16) and left eye (md 0.03 logmar, 95 ci -0.09 to 0.15). in the other study people in the acetalomazide group had a similar change in vision over six

concerns for pregnancy,2008,,,"context: the use of bariatric surgery for treating severe obesity has increased dramatically over the past 10 years about half of patients who undergo these procedures are women of reproductive age. this report was commissioned to measure the incidence of bariatric surgery in this population and review the evidence on the impact of bariatric surgery on fertility and subsequent pregnancy., objectives: to measure the incidence of contemporary bariatric surgery procedures in women age 18-45 and to assess its impact on fertility, contraception, prepregnancy risk factors, and pregnancy outcomes, including those of neonates., data sources and study selection: nationwide inpatient sample (nis), a national sample of over 1,000 hospitals, to measure the trend in the number of women of reproductive age who underwent bariatric procedures from 1998-2005. we searched numerous electronic databases, including medline and embase, for potentially relevant studies involving bariatric surgery (gastric bypass, laparoscopic adjustable gastric band, vertical-banded gastroplasty, biliopancreatic diversion), and consequent fertility, contraception, pregnancy, weight management, maternal and neonatal outcomes, and nutritional deficiencies. we scanned reference lists for additional relevant articles and contacted experts in the fields of bariatric surgery and obstetrics/gynecology (ob/gyn). of 223 screened articles, we accepted 57 that reported on fertility following surgery (19 articles), contraception use/recommendations (11), maternal weight or nutrition management (28), maternal outcomes including morbidity and mortality (48), cesarean-section rates (16), and neonatal outcomes (44). these articles included reports on gastric bypass, both open and laparoscopic (27 articles), laparoscopic adjustable band (15), biliopancreatic diversion (16), and vertical-banded gastroplasty (6). studies could contribute to one or more analyses. we found one case-control study and the observational data accepted included 12 cohort studies, 21 case series, and 23 individual case reports., data extraction: we abstracted information about study design, fertility history, fertility outcomes, prepregnancy weight loss, nutritional management, outcomes following pregnancy, and adverse events (during pregnancy) related to surgery., data synthesis: nationally representative data showed a six-fold increase in bariatric surgery inpatient procedures from 1998 to 2005. women age 18-45 accounted for about half of the patients undergoing bariatric surgery over 50,000 have these procedures as inpatients annually. an unknown number have outpatient bariatric procedures. we identified one case-control study that directly addressed some of the key questions, but no randomized controlled trials or prospective cohort studies, which would be the strongest study designs to answer questions about effectiveness, risk and prognosis. consequently, all of our conclusions are limited by the available data, and are cautious. the evidence suggests that bariatric surgery results in improved fertility the strongest evidence is in women with the polycystic ovarian syndrome, where biochemical studies showing normalization of hormones after surgery support case series data. observational studies (retrospective cohorts and case series) suggest that fertility improves following bariatric procedures and weight loss similar to that seen when obese women lose weight through nonsurgical means. there is almost no evidence on post-surgical contraceptive efficacy or use. research is needed to determine whether differences in absorption, particularly for oral contraceptives, affect contraceptive efficacy. nutrient deficiencies were reported in infants born to women who underwent procedures that resulted in malabsorption, as well as women who did not take prenatal vitamins or had difficulty with their own nutrition (i.e., from chronic vomiting). literature suggests that gastric bypass and laparoscopic adjustable band procedures confer only minimal, if any, increased risk of nutritional or congenital problems if supplemental vitamins are taken and maternal nutrition is otherwise adequate. biliopancreatic diversion has an appreciable risk for nutritional problems in some patients. women who have undergone bariatric surgery may have less risk than obese women for certain pregnancy complications such as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and pregnancy induced hypertension. there is no evidence that cesarean section rates and delivery complications are higher in the post-surgery group, but data are limited., conclusions: weight loss procedures are being performed more frequently to treat morbid obesity, with a six-fold increase over a recent 7-year time span almost half of all patients are women of reproductive age. the level of evidence on fertility, contraception, and pregnancy outcomes is limited to observational studies. data suggest that fertility improves after bariatric surgical procedures, nutritional deficiencies for mother and child are minimal, and maternal and neonatal outcomes are acceptable with laparoscopic adjustable band and gastric bypass as long as adequate maternal nutrition and vitamin supplementation are maintained. there is no evidence that delivery complications are higher in post-surgery pregnancies.",696,1.0

neointimal hyperplasia, vessel stenosis, and eventually thrombosis. these events predominate in the juxta_anastomotic segment in av fistulae (avf) and at the venous anastomosis in av grafts (avg). certain factors such as surgical anastomotic configuration and wall shear stress (wss)1 have been shown to cause endothelial dysfunction, leading to activation and intimal migration of fibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle cells, and proliferation of microvessels2. other implicated causes include chronic kidney disease_mediated vasculopathy3, inadequate outward remodelling and compliance mismatch due to vessel wall stiffness in synthetic av grafts, and increased arterial stiffness in diabetes mellitus. on a molecular level, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation may be initiated by growth factors (pdgf_bb), hormones, or other stimuli such as uremia, oxidative stress, tissue injury, inflammation, cytokines, and certain drugs. via various pathways, they influence production of transcription factors (non_coding micrornas mirs) that direct gene activity. these mirs help downregulate gene expression through translational repression or degradation of target mrna (autophagy), causing phenotype switching of vascular smooth muscle cells from contractile to synthetic. this results in increased proliferation, migration, matrix secretion, and microvessel proliferation. although our knowledge of the molecular processes driving neointimal hyperplasia is rapidly expanding, many questions remain to be answered with respect to mechanisms of action, particularly in veins. avfs have a much higher reported primary failure rate than avgs due to non_maturation4. once mature, avfs require fewer interventions than avgs to maintain similar cumulative patency. early surgical or endovascular intervention may result in salvage of immature avfs with acceptable post_intervention primary patency (pipp) and access circuit primary patency (acpp). however, there is a paucity of published level i data on cumulative patency following pre_emptive dilatation. in a non_randomized study, timmy lee et al. reported cumulative avf survival of 68 vs.78 vs. 92, respectively, at 1 year following 2 vs.1 vs. 0 interventions prior to achieving maturation. at 2 years, avf survival was 57 vs.71 vs.85, respectively, and at 3 years, avf survival was 42 vs. 57 vs. 75, respectively. frequency of intervention to maintain patency after maturation was 3.51 2.2 vs.1.37 0.31 vs.0.76 0.10, respectively, per year. they concluded that avfs requiring intervention to maintain patency had decreased cumulative survival compared with those that spontaneously matured5. the rationale for pre_emptive dilatation of stenoses in dialysis access follows kdoqi surveillance guidelines6. avfs with access dysfunction and/or access blood flow (qa) 400_500 ml/min and avgs with either qa 600 ml/min or qa 1000 ml/min with a decrease of 25 should be referred for stenosis imaging and treatment. in a randomized trial, tessitore et al. reported that elective stenosis revision in functional avfs with qa 350 ml/min resulted in a fourfold reduction in risk of access loss compared with intervention in dysfunctional avfs7. vascular access screening also detects subclinical and significant stenoses (50) in properly functioning avfs with qa 500 ml/min. these avfs can deliver adequate dialysis with a low risk of failure8. no intervention is warranted in such cases since the stenosis is not hemodynamically significant (i.e., poor clearance, prolonged bleeding, difficult cannulation, and 50 stenosis, with a trending change in access flow or pressure). treatment may be harmful since unnecessary angioplasty (pta) for stable or slow_growing stenoses may impair access survival by prompting aggressive restenosis due to accelerated neointimal hyperplasia9. av access surveillance and pre_emptive treatment of severe stenosis have been reported to reduce the incidence of thrombosis. howev r, randomized controlled trials failed to confirm improved long_term av access survival. in a systematic review and analysis, tonelli et al.10 reported no conclusive evidence that screening with access flow measurements prevented access loss in fistulas or grafts nor did pre_emptive angioplasty result in improved quality of life or conserved resources. moreover, randomized controlled trials did not demonstrate benefit of surveillance in grafts. in a randomized trial to test the hypothesis that pre_emptive treatment of avgs reduces thrombosis rates and increases access survival compared with treatment only at time of dysfunction or thrombosis, dember et al.11 randomized 64 patients to 2 study arms (observation and pre_emptive treatment). monthly static venous pressure/ systolic pressure ratios (svpr) were obtained. values 0.4 triggered pre_emptive intervention in the treatment group, whereas patients in the observation group only underwent study and treatment for access dysfunction or thrombosis. during the 3.5_year study period, the proportion of patients with a thrombotic event was significantly greater in the observation group. however, both groups showed similar thrombosis rates, identical access abandonment (14 patients/ group), and no statistical difference in time to access abandonment. in a sequential observational trial, shahin et al.12 compared historical controls (physical exam) with physical exam plus monthly access flow monitoring (ultrasound dilution technique). the addition of access flow monitoring resulted in a sevenfold increase in angioplasty procedures (0.67 vs. 0.09 per access_year). angioplasty effectively restored flow to original baseline, with no improvement in thrombosis rate or cumulative patency. primary assisted patency decreased due to the increased rate of angioplasty. in their report on interim analysis of a randomized controlled trial, tessitore et al. confirmed that treating asymptomatic stenoses could trigger aggressive stenosis, leading to thrombosis13. another potential concern was the generation of high qa (2000 ml/min) leading to high_output heart failure14. paclitaxel_coated balloons employed after successful conventional or high_pressure angioplasty retard neointimal hyperplasia and stenosis in avfs and possibly in avgs. their mechanism of action involves stabilization of nuclear microtubules causing tubular overload of cells and arrest of cell division at the g2/m checkpoint, thus preventing cytokinesis. three significantly flawed trials reported results with paclitaxel_coated balloons in treating avf and avg stenosis in 51 patients15,16,17. sixmonth primary patency ranged from 70 to 92.3. two of the studies reported 12_month patency of 90.9 and 2016,17. one study reported 24_month patency of 57.816. these results suggest a short_term advantage of paclitaxel_coated balloons over conventional balloons in retarding neointimal hyperplasia. patane et al.s unusually good longterm results were outliers without a control group for comparison. perhaps most importantly, the concept of pre_emptive treatment of av access stenosis is misguided, based on the idea that repeatedly dilating a stenosis with a balloon will somehow correct abnormalities of wall shear stress, vascular remodeling, compliance mismatch, and suboptimal anastomotic angles/configuration to favorably improve long_term access viability. instead, we must recognize that stenosis is the macro_manifestation of molecular response to vessel injury and endothelial dysfunction. the ultimate solution will reside in our understanding of vessel wall molecular biology and our use of genetic tools to influence or control the factors that upregulate and downregulate the genetic response to injury.",700,1.0

identified in the search. studies brought to the full-text stage were then screened by another two review authors working independently. however, none of the full-text studies met the inclusion criteria. had we included studies, we would have assessed their methodological quality by using the criteria recommended in the cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions. we intended to co bine dichotomous data using risk ratios (rrs), and continuous data using mean differences (mds). for each outcome, we intended to calculate overall effect size with 95 confidence intervals (cis)., main results: none of the studies that were screened met the inclusion criteria., authors conclusions: none of the studies that were assessed met the inclusion criteria of this review. therefore we were unable to determine the effectiveness of interventions for the management of obesity in individuals with bipolar disorder. given the extent and impact of the problem and the absence of evidence, this review highlights the need for research in this area. we suggest the need for rcts that will focus only on populations with bipolar disorder and comorbid obesity. we identified several ongoing studies that may be included in the update of this review. copyright 2020 the cochrane collaboration. published by john wiley sons, ltd.",748,1.0

775,v. vidal,haemorrhoid embolisation,2017,10.1007/s00270-017-1725-y,cn-01418821,"learning objectives 1. to learn about the principles and concepts of haemorrhoid embolisation 2. to learn about the results and outcomes of haemorrhoid embolisation 3. to learn about potential complications of haemorrhoid embolisation and how to avoid them hemorrhoidal disease is the most common anorectal condition, with a prevalence of 4_35. one of its main chronic symptoms is rectal bleeding. its recurrence can alter the quality of life and can, more rarely, cause anemia. pain is less common, occurring only in the event of a complication (congestive exacerbation, external hemorrhoidal thrombosis, and fissures). the most common treatment involves hygiene and dietary measures, phlebotonics, and/or nonsurgical outpatient treatment (infrared photocoagulation and elastic band ligation). the hemorrhoidal arteriovenous network is a normal vascular formation. there is a clear distinction between the external hemorrhoidal network below the dentate line (under the skin of the anal margin dependent on the pudendal artery, which is a branch of the inferior rectal artery) and the internal hemorrhoidal network located in the upper part of the anal canal above the dentate line (in the submucosal space depending on the superior rectal artery). internal hemorrhoids are now considered to result from an increase in arterial blood flow from the superior rectal artery into the hemorrhoidal cushion (corpus cavernosum recti) (1). the replacement of muscle tissue by connective tissue causes an expansion of the vascular network of the anorectal submucosa, initiating a negative vicious circle of progressive vascular dilation and venous insufficiency leading to hemorrhoidal hyperplasia. this hyperplasia causes an increase in blood pressure, arterial inflow, and anal pressure in the corpus cavernosum recti. the lower part of the rectum and the anal canal are known to be supplied with blood by the inferior and middle rectal arteries, both of which have origins (pudendal artery and iliac network, respectively) at some distance from the inferior mesenteric artery (2). by contrast, the mechanical function of the corpus cavernosum recti is dependent on the influx of arterial blood from the branches (superior rectal arteries) of the inferior mesenteric artery. ten years ago, proctologists developed a new type of treatment: elective transanal doppler_guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation (dg_hal). dg_hal technique involves the identification and ligation of the superior rectal arteries under transanal doppler guidance. the ligation of the superior rectal arteries provides a significant reduction in the arterial blood flow to the hemorrhoid and is effective in treating hemorrhoidal disease (3). it was feasible that this technique could be compatible with embolization. thus, we have previously reported that arterial ligation can be performed with coils in the terminal branches of the superior rectal arteries via the endovascular route (4). the advantages of emborrhoid and dg_hal techniques over surgery are that it maintains the hemorrhoidal tissue in place, preserves anal continence without rectal wounds (no local care), causes significantly less pain, and avoids the complications of open surgery, thus allowing a faster return to activity. emborrhoid embolization is performed using the right femoral route. the inferior mesenteric artery is catheterized using a simmons catheter. the superior rectal arteries are then catheterized using a microcatheter. coils used for the embolization are 0.018_inch long, with 2_3 mm in diameter. technical success of the emborrhoid technique has been reported in up to 90 of patients. clinical success of the emborrhoid technique has been reported in 74_83 of patients with no complications (2, 5). the main advantages of the emborrhoid technique are as follows: patients feel absolutely no pain. no major complication, especially no ischemic or continence complication, is related to the emborrhoid technique. this technique is available for outpatients. patient can return to activity the day after e bolization. embolization allows a complementary treatment if essential. the technique can be easily performed within an hour. endovascular treatment offers many benefits, including the complete visualization of all branches of superior rectal arteries and anastomoses with middle and inferior rectal arteries (6). using the dg_hal technique, all arteries may not be detected, which can lead to incomplete treatment especially if anastomoses are present. embolization eliminates the risk of direct anorectal trauma. the results of our previous study (7) have confirmed the favorable clinical results of previous studies and have also objectively demonstrated that at 1 month after embolization, hemorrhoidal bundles significantly decrease in size that embolization particles do not cause ischemia in histology and that the sphincter exhibits a normal physiology 1 month after embolization. we hypothesized that embolization is more effective with particles because they cause a more distal hemorrhoidal plexus embolization, thereby restricting the superior rectal arteries reloads by the middle rectal arteries. a randomized controlled study is warranted for confirming the benefits of this technique. many patients suffer from hemorrhoids but do not complain to physicians because they do not wish to have an endorectal treatment. we believe that if a pain_free treatment for this condition is offered to outpatients, more patients will seek treatment. given the preliminary results reported in our studies, we believe that there is sufficient evidence to include embolization in therapeutic options for patients with bleeding related to hemorrhoidal disease. we have demonstrated that distal coil embolization of superior rectal arteries to stop chronic bleeding is safe and effective. the results of our previous study (7) have demonstrated that embolization of superior rectal arteries with particles does not lead to ischemia. particle embolization leads to more distal embolization of the hemorrhoidal plexus, lower than the anastomoses with the middle rectal arteries. new embolic agents may provide an opportunity for the development of the emborrhoid technique.",766,1.0
