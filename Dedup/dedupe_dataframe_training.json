"abstract": "bariatric surgery is the only treatment with long standing effect of morbid obesity. the key elements to success are the patient_selection, an experienced bariatric team and a completed follow_up program. follow_up programs can consist of, for example, providing social support in support groups, teaching psychological skills, such as coping with the body change or teaching self_regulation of body weight. furthermore, follow_up is important for dietary and sports counselling. the experience of the team members and coaching skills are essential in indicating the suitable procedure if necessary and guide the patients through the process. various studies showed a significant positive effect of a completed follow_up program after bariatric surgery on maintaining weight loss. there is a burden for this on site provided care as organizational and financial resources are not unlimited. especially as the follow_up period is an obligatory 5 years or if possible life long. even if this aftercare is provided, not all patients complete the complete program. various reasons are possible for an increasing no_show_rate, the loss of enthusiasm for onsite visits could be one of them. analogue to other chronic diseases, the addition of telehealth could be useful. telehealth is the delivery of health_related services and information via telecommunications technologies. it encompasses preventative, promotive and curative aspects. examples are exchanging health services or education via videoconference, transmission of medical data for disease management (remote monitoring) and advice on prevention of diseases and promotion of good health by patient monitoring and follow_up. the participation of ehealth has been investigated and considered useful in the treatment of obesity. in a systematic review self_measured blood pressure monitoring was associated with better control of hypertension at least in the first year. its value in a bariatric tract has not been investigated. it can be hypothesized that self_control by ehealth could enhance clinical outcome as more weight loss and comorbidity reduction. long_term realistic goals setting, consistent use of routines and self_monitoring has been proven effective for weight loss maintenance. patients with higher self_control are more certain regarding their abilities, which cause higher commitment and adherence to the program. this eventually leads to more weight loss. for this purpose an online monitoring program was designed for our obesity centre (bepatient) to provide preoperative information as well as aids in the post_bariatric phase by self_control wireless devices for registration of biometric outcomes, teleconference opportunities and access to additional information. in a prospective trial the implementation in several degrees is evaluated."}, {"Author": "d. p. versteegden, m. van himbeeck and s. w. nienhuijs", "Title": "assessing the value of ehealth for bariatric

"10.1007/s00270-017-1725-y", "Accessionnumber": "cn-01418821", "abstract": "learning objectives 1. to learn about the principles and concepts of haemorrhoid embolisation 2. to learn about the results and outcomes of haemorrhoid embolisation 3. to learn about potential complications of haemorrhoid embolisation and how to avoid them hemorrhoidal disease is the most common anorectal condition, with a prevalence of 4_35. one of its main chronic symptoms is rectal bleeding. its recurrence can alter the quality of life and can, more rarely, cause anemia. pain is less common, occurring only in the event of a complication (congestive exacerbation, external hemorrhoidal thrombosis, and fissures). the most common treatment involves hygiene and dietary measures, phlebotonics, and/or nonsurgical outpatient treatment (infrared photocoagulation and elastic band ligation). the hemorrhoidal arteriovenous network is a normal vascular formation. there is a clear distinction between the external hemorrhoidal network below the dentate line (under the skin of the anal margin dependent on the pudendal artery, which is a branch of the inferior rectal artery) and the internal hemorrhoidal network located in the upper part of the anal canal above the dentate line (in the submucosal space depending on the superior rectal artery). internal hemorrhoids are now considered to result from an increase in arterial blood flow from the superior rectal artery into the hemorrhoidal cushion (corpus cavernosum recti) (1). the replacement of muscle tissue by connective tissue causes an expansion of the vascular network of the anorectal submucosa, initiating a negative vicious circle of progressive vascular dilation and venous insufficiency leading to hemorrhoidal hyperplasia. this hyperplasia causes an increase in blood pressure, arterial inflow, and anal pressure in the corpus cavernosum recti. the lower part of the rectum and the anal canal are known to be supplied with blood by the inferior and middle rectal arteries, both of which have origins (pudendal artery and iliac network, respectively) at some distance from the inferior mesenteric artery (2). by contrast, the mechanical function of the corpus cavernosum recti is dependent on the influx of arterial blood from the branches (superior rectal arteries) of the inferior mesenteric artery. ten years ago, proctologists developed a new type of treatment: elective transanal doppler_guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation (dg_hal). dg_hal technique involves the identification and ligation of the superior rectal arteries under transanal doppler guidance. the ligation of the superior rectal arteries provides a significant reduction in the arterial blood flow to the hemorrhoid and is effective in treating hemorrhoidal disease (3). it was feasible that this technique could be compatible with embolization. thus, we have previously reported that arterial ligation can be performed with coils in the terminal branches of the superior rectal arteries via the endovascular route (4). the advantages of emborrhoid and dg_hal techniques over surgery are that it maintains the hemorrhoidal tissue in place, preserves anal continence without rectal wounds (no local care), causes significantly less pain, and avoids the complications of open surgery, thus allowing a faster return to activity. emborrhoid embolization is performed using the right femoral route. the inferior mesenteric artery is catheterized using a simmons catheter. the superior rectal arteries are then catheterized using a microcatheter. coils used for the embolization are 0.018_inch long, with 2_3 mm in diameter. technical success of the emborrhoid technique has been reported in up to 90 of patients. clinical success of the emborrhoid technique has been reported in 74_83 of patients with no complications (2, 5). the main advantages of the emborrhoid technique are as follows: patients feel absolutely no pain. no major complication, especially no ischemic or continence complication, is related to the emborrhoid technique. this technique is available for outpatients. patient can return to activity the day after e bolization. embolization allows a complementary treatment if essential. the technique can be easily performed within an hour. endovascular treatment offers many benefits, including the complete visualization of all branches of superior rectal arteries and anastomoses with middle and inferior rectal arteries (6). using the dg_hal technique, all arteries may not be detected, which can lead to incomplete treatment especially if anastomoses are present. embolization eliminates the risk of direct anorectal trauma. the results of our previous study (7) have confirmed the favorable clinical results of previous studies and have also objectively demonstrated that at 1 month after embolization, hemorrhoidal bundles significantly decrease in size that embolization particles do not cause ischemia in histology and that the sphincter exhibits a normal physiology 1 month after embolization. we hypothesized that embolization is more effective with particles because they cause a more distal hemorrhoidal plexus embolization, thereby restricting the superior rectal arteries reloads by the middle rectal arteries. a randomized controlled study is warranted for confirming the benefits of this technique. many patients suffer from hemorrhoids but do not complain to physicians because they do not wish to have an endorectal treatment. we believe that if a pain_free treatment for this condition is offered to outpatients, more patients will seek treatment. given the preliminary results reported in our studies, we believe that there is sufficient evidence to include embolization in therapeutic options for patients with bleeding related to hemorrhoidal disease. we have demonstrated that distal coil embolization of superior rectal arteries to stop chronic bleeding is safe and effective. the results of our previous study (7) have demonstrated that embolization of superior rectal arteries with particles does not lead to ischemia. particle embolization leads to more distal embolization of the hemorrhoidal plexus, lower than the anastomoses with the middle rectal arteries. new embolic agents may provide an opportunity for the development of the emborrhoid technique."}]}, {"__class__": "tuple", "__value__":

non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and even obesity itself. importantly, there are limited data on therapeutic strategies for vitamin d deficiency in bariatric patients, and the procedure-specific guidelines may not be sufficient. to improve long-term outcomes, nutritional screening and appropriate supplementation to prevent nutrient deficiencies are urgently needed. therefore, the aim of this study is to examine effects and safety of a forced dosing regimen of vitamin d versus conventional dose supplementation on vitamin d levels and other parameters in bariatric patients., methods/design: the study includes loading plus repeat dosing compared with repeated administration of vitamin d without a loading dose, according to guidelines, in a prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. up to a triple oral loading dose is given on day 1, then 2 and 4 weeks after surgery (100,000 iu dose each time), followed by an oral maintenance dose (3420 iu/day). the control group (n 25) will receive placebo, followed by administration of a standard dose (3420 iu/day). we hypothesize that a significant increase in vitamin d levels will occur in patients in the treatment group (n 25) by 24 weeks after surgery. further measurements are aimed at evaluating changes in inflammation, bone turnover, insulin resistance, blood pressure, liver, mental health, and gut microbiota of patients undergoing omega-loop gastric bypass surgery. furthermore, possible associations between concentrations of vitamin d, the involved enzymes, or vitamin d receptor in adipose and/or liver tissues will be determined., discussion: to our knowledge, this trial is the first of its kind with this type of vitamin d supplementation in bariatric patients. its major strength is the design and implementation of evaluation of influencing factors such as liver function, bone health, inflammation, insulin resistance, blood pressure, symptoms of depression, or microbiota. this alternative vitamin d dosing regimen has the potential to be a safe, fast, evidence-based treatment of vitamin d deficiency in bariatric patients. owing to the increasing number of bariatric patients, it is also of interest to

kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 35 or higher at 5 national health service hospitals in the uk between march 1, 2014, and may 25, 2017. of 74 women assessed for eligibility, 6 did not meet study criteria and 2 declined to participate 66 women were randomized. data were analyzed from november 1, 2018, to may 14, 2020. intervention(s): bariatric surgery (n 33) or cwm intervention (weight watchers) (n 33). main outcomes and measures: the primary outcome was change in intracranial pressure measured by lumbar puncture opening pressure at 12 months, as assessed in an intention-to-treat analysis. secondary outcomes included lumbar puncture opening pressure at 24 months as well as visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, perimetric mean deviation, and quality of life (measured by the 36-item short form health survey) at 12 and 24 months. because the difference in continuous outcomes between groups is presented, the null effect was at 0. result(s): of the 66 female participants (mean sd age, 32.0 7.8 years), 64 (97.0) remained in the clinical trial at 12 months and 54 women (81.8) were included in the primary outcome analysis. intracranial pressure was significantly lower in the bariatric surgery arm at 12 months (adjusted mean se difference, -6.0 1.8 cm cerebrospinal fluid csf 95 ci, -9.5 to -2.4 cm csf p .001) and at 24 months (adjusted mean se difference, -8.2 2.0 cm csf 95 ci, -12.2 to -4.2 cm csf p .001) compared with the cwm arm. in the per protocol analysis, intracranial pressure was significantly lower in the bariatric surgery arm at 12 months (adjusted mean se difference, -7.2 1.8 cm csf 95 ci, -10.6 to -3.7 cm csf p .001) and at 24 months (adjusted mean se difference, -8.7 2.0 cm csf 95 ci, -12.7 to -4.8 cm csf p .001). weight was significantly lower in the bariatric surgery arm at 12 months (adjusted mean se difference, -21.4 5.4 kg 95 ci, -32.1 to -10.7 kg p .001) and at 24 months (adjusted mean se difference, -26.6 5.6 kg 95 ci, -37.5 to -15.7 kg p .001). quality of life was significantly improved at 12 months (adjusted mean se difference, 7.3 3.6 95 ci, 0.2-14.4 p .04) and 24 months (adjusted mean se difference, 10.4 3.8 95 ci, 3.0-17.9 p .006) in the bariatric surgery arm. conclusions and relevance: in this randomized clinical trial, bariatric surgery was superior to a cwm intervention in lowering intracranial pressure. the continued improvement over the course of 2 years shows the impact of this intervention with regard to sustained disease remission. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov

found to be associated with several diseases, including diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and even obesity itself. importantly, there are limited data on therapeutic strategies for vitamin d deficiency in bariatric patients, and the procedure-specific guidelines may not be sufficient. to improve long-term outcomes, nutritional screening and appropriate supplementation to prevent nutrient deficiencies are urgently needed. therefore, the aim of this study is to examine effects and safety of a forced dosing regimen of vitamin d versus conventional dose supplementation on vitamin d levels and other parameters in bariatric patients., methods/design: the study includes loading plus repeat dosing compared with repeated administration of vitamin d without a loading dose, according to guidelines, in a prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. up to a triple oral loading dose is given on day 1, then 2 and 4 weeks after surgery (100,000 iu dose each time), followed by an oral maintenance dose (3420 iu/day). the control group (n 25) will receive placebo, followed by administration of a standard dose (3420 iu/day). we hypothesize that a significant increase in vitamin d levels will occur in patients in the treatment group (n 25) by 24 weeks after surgery. further measurements are aimed at evaluating changes in inflammation, bone turnover, insulin resistance, blood pressure, liver, mental health, and gut microbiota of patients undergoing omega-loop gastric bypass surgery. furthermore, possible associations between concentrations of vitamin d, the involved enzymes, or vitamin d receptor in adipose and/or liver tissues will be determined., discussion: to our knowledge, this trial is the first of its kind with this type of vitamin d supplementation in bariatric patients. its major strength is the design and implementation of evaluation of influencing factors such as liver function, bone health, inflammation, insulin resistance, blood pressure, symptoms of depression, or microbiota. this alternative vitamin d dosing regimen has the potential to be a safe, fast, evidence-based treatment of vitamin d deficiency in bariatric patients. owing to the increasing number of bariatric patients, it is also of interest to elucidate the link between obesity and vitamin d., trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov identifier:

that weight loss following gastric bypass is greater than vertical banded gastroplasty or adjustable gastric banding, but similar to isolated sleeve gastrectomy and banded gastric bypass. isolated

including diet, reduced sedentariness, and increased physical activity, is usually recommended for patients with obesity however, the long-term success of these strategies for reducing adiposity, maintaining weight loss, and reducing blood pressure has been limited. effective pharmacotherapeutic and procedural strategies, including metabolic surgeries, are additional options to treat obesity and prevent or attenuate obesity hypertension, target organ damage, and subsequent disease. medications can be useful for short- and long-term obesity treatment however, prescription of these drugs is limited. metabolic surgery is effective for producing sustained weight loss and for treating hypertension and metabolic disorders in many patients with severe obesity. unanswered questions remain related to the mechanisms of obesity-related diseases, long-term efficacy of different treatment and prevention strategies, and timing of these interventions to prevent obesity and

countries since the 1980s. obesity contributes directly to incident cardiovascular risk factors, including dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and sleep disorders. obesity also leads to the development of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular disease mortality independently of other cardiovascular risk factors. more recent data highlight abdominal obesity, as determined by waist circumference, as a cardiovascular disease risk marker that is independent of body mass index. there have also been significant advances in imaging modalities for characterizing body composition, including visceral adiposity. studies that quantify fat depots, including ectopic fat, support excess visceral adiposity as an independent indicator of poor cardiovascular outcomes. lifestyle modification and subsequent weight loss improve both metabolic syndrome and associated systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. however, clinical trials of medical weight loss have not demonstrated a reduction in coronary artery disease rates. in contrast, prospective studies comparing patients undergoing bariatric surgery with nonsurgical patients with obesity have shown reduced coronary artery disease risk with surgery. in this statement, we summarize the impact of obesity on the diagnosis, clinical management, and outcomes of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart

long been associated with obesity, and weight loss continues to be a first-line therapy in the treatment of hypertension. lifestyle modification and pharmacologic therapy, however, often meet with treatment failure. bariatric surgery continues to be the most successful approach to sustained weight loss. this review focuses on the underlying physiologic mechanisms of obesity-hypertension, and the impact of bariatric surgery on the treatment of hypertension. current available literature on the physiologic mechanisms of obesity-hypertension, and the major trials, meta-analyses and systematic reviews of the impact of bariatric surgery procedures on hypertension are reviewed. evidence suggests significant improvement in obesity-hypertension in patients who undergo surgical weight-reduction procedures. malabsorptive techniques such as the roux-en-y gastric bypass or surgical resection techniques such as laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy appear to offer superior results in regards to hypertension control over restrictive techniques such as gastric banding. though long-term control of hypertension following surgery remains a concern, available follow-up post-operative data of up to 10 years suggests a sustained, if lessened, effect on hypertension control over time. copyright american journal of hypertension, ltd 2017. all rights reserved. for permissions, please email:

methods: this prospective, observational study included only patients with t2dm who had the djbl implanted for at least 6 months and had a follow-up of at least 12 months after explantation. the primary endpoints were changes in glycosylated hemoglobin a1c (hba1c) and body weight during the 12 months after explantation. secondary endpoints were changes in fasting plasma glucose, blood

setting: university medical center, united states., methods: forty t2d patients (mean /- sd: age, 51.3 /-10.0 yr weight 109.5 /- 15.0 kg body mass index bmi 36.5 /- 3.7 kg/m2 hba1c 8.2 /- 1.2) were randomized to lagb (n 18) or dwm (n 22)., results: at 3 years, 13 of 16 patients in lagb and 5 of 17 patients in dwm achieved resolution of hyperglycemia (p .601), with a modestly greater reduction in antidiabetic medications in the surgical group (p .054). reductions from baseline in a1c were sustained at 3 years in lagb (-.82 95 ci: -1.62 to -.01, p .046) compared with dwm (.23 95 ci: -.57 to 1.03, p .567). the surgical group had greater weight loss (-12.0 kg 95 ci: -15.9 to -8.1 versus -4.8 95 ci: -8.6 to -.9, p .010). hdl-cholesterol increased more after surgery (p .003), but changes in triglycerides, ldl-cholesterol, and blood pressure did not differ between treatments. diabetes- and obesity-specific quality of life improved comparably with both therapies., conclusions: achievement of american diabetes association targets for glucose, lipids, and blood pressure was similar with both treatment strategies. lagb leads to greater sustained weight loss and higher hdl cholesterol compared with a dwm program. these findings may help guide patients with t2d and obesity when exploring options for diabetes and weight management. copyright 2019. published by elsevier inc."}]},

cardiovascular risk factors. more recent data highlight abdominal obesity, as determined by waist circumference, as a cardiovascular disease risk marker that is independent of body mass index. there have also been significant advances in imaging modalities for characterizing body composition, including visceral adiposity. studies that quantify fat depots, including ectopic fat, support excess visceral adiposity as an independent indicator of poor cardiovascular outcomes. lifestyle modification and subsequent weight loss improve both metabolic syndrome and associated systemic inflammation
