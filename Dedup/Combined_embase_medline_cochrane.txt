Ziyadeh"	Effects of weight reduction regimens and bariatric surgery on chronic kidney disease in obese patients	2013	https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajprenal.00173.2013		"Increasing evidence nowadays is showing that obesity by itself, independent of other comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension, is associated with renal functional changes and structural damage. Intentional weight loss demonstrates beneficial reduction in proteinuria and albuminuria in patients with mild to moderate chronic kidney disease, particularly those whose renal damage is likely induced by obesity. The safety of some weight loss interventions, particularly the use of high-protein diets and/or medications, is questionable in this population due to the lack of well-designed randomized controlled studies reporting on their efficacy or harm. Bariatric surgery showed the most promising results with regards to ameliorating glomerular hyperfiltration and albuminuria albeit with a modest risk of increased perioperative complications with advanced stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). © 2013 by the American Physiological Society."

Primary objectives were to determine if ESG achieves a priori thresholds defined by a 2011 joint GI and surgical society consensus statement and included:1) mean excess weight loss (EWL) of more than 25% in the ESG arm at 52 weeks with a 15% EWL difference compared to LS 2) Device or procedure-related serious adverse event(SAE) rate of <5%.Modified intention to treat analysis (mITT) using mixed effects model was performed Results: 208 patients were randomized [ESG (n=85) or LS (123)], of whom 77 and 110 patients underwent the ESG procedure or initiated the LS program, respectively, and were included in the mITT analysis.ESG resulted in 44.7% [95% CI 38.8 - 50.7] more %EWL compared to moderate-intensity LS intervention alone (p<0.001) at 52 weeks,representing a 12.6% [95% CI 10.9 - 14.1] difference in % total body weight loss (%TBWL) between the two groups (p<0.001)(Figure 1).At 104 weeks, the ESG cohort maintained 91% of the weight lost at week 52, averaging 12.4+/-8.4% TBWL. 72 patients from the LS cohort crossed over to ESG at 52 weeks.The cross-over cohort achieved an additional 44.1+/- 27% EWL compared to the weight loss achieved after 52 weeks of LS alone (p<0.001) (Figure 1).ESG resulted in significant improvement in type II DM, hypertension,and metabolic syndrome compared to LS (Table 1).HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) significantly improved at 52 in the ESG cohort (p=0.002) vs. worsened in the LS cohort.Among patients with HbA1c >= 6.5% at baseline (n=25) who underwent ESG, the mean HbA1c improvement at 52 weeks was 1.65% (p=0.004).ESG did not worsen gastroesophageal reflux disease on standardized questionnaires and resulted in significant improvement in quality of life, eating behaviors, and depression.The majority (80%) of ESG patients would definitely recommend the ESG to a friend or family member suffering from obesity. In the ESG cohort, no mortality was reported, and the rate of SAE was 2% (3/149) with none requiring surgical interventions, blood transfusion, or intensive care, and all resolving without sequelea. Conclusion(s): ESG is ready for expanded clinical adoption to augment the spectrum of obesity and metabolic care [Formula presented] [Formula presented]Copyright © 2022"

Actrn	Early postoperative enteral feeding in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer	2010		CN-02433336	"INTERVENTION: Postoperative enteral feeding plus standard postoperative diet. During surgery an enteral feeding tube will be inserted through the patient's nose into their small bowel. The location of the feeding tube is checked by the surgeon via palpation intra_operatively, as well as by plain x_ray postoperatively. A standard fibre containing enteral nutrition formula (4.2kJ/ml) will be fed through the nasojejunal tube postoperatively. Feeding will commence at a rate of 40mls/hr 4 hours after return to ward after surgery. Feeds will remain at this rate for the first 24 hours. The following day, feed rates will be increased to an individualised goal. The goal of enteral nutrition is to provide patients with 125 kilojoules per kilogram of body weight (adjusted using standard methodology for overweight patients). Patients randomised to early postoperative enteral feeding will be monitored daily by a nutritionist and will have their diet modified accordingly. Patients randomised to postoperative enteral feeding can also commence standard postoperative diet on return to ward. This usually involves sips of water and clear fluid commencing on the return to the ward after surgery. This ""standard diet"" may vary slightly from institution to institution. CONDITION: Postoperative enteral feeding Primary epithelial ovarian cancer Primary fallopian tube cancer Primary peritoneal cancer moderate malnourishment severe malnourishment PRIMARY OUTCOME: Quality of life. ; This study will use the FACT_O, an ovarian cancer specific quality of life measurement. This questionnaire will be completed by patients at Baseline, and at Follow Up #1 _ 6 weeks after surgery, and Follow Up #2 _ 30 days following the thirds cycle of postoperative chemotherapy. ; The FACT_O is an ovarian cancer subscale that has been constructed to complement the FACT_G, addressing relevant disease, treatment, or condition related issues not already convered in the general FACT_G questionnaire. Each is intended to be as specific as necessary to capture the clinically relevant problems associated with a given condition or symptom, yet general enough to allow for comparison across diseases, and extension, as appropriate to other chronic medical conditions. ; The FACT_G was developed by the Centre on Outcomes, Research and Education (CORE) to determine the quality of life of cancer patients, and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT_G). ; The FACT_O is a widely utilized quality of life questionnaire. It is a self_report scale and allows patients to rate their current physical, functional, social/family, and emotional well_being. Treatment costs and cost effectiveness. ; The purpose of the analysis is to estimate the length of stay in the hospital and the difference in cost outcomes between the two arms. Patients in the control arm will have some observed length of stay in hospital. Patients in the intervention arm will incur the marginal costs of the feeding and will have some observed length of stay in hospital. The question we seek to address is whether the cost of the feeding is offset by the cost savings from any reductions in length of stay in hospital. ; ; ; The difference in costs between the two groups will be expressed as: ; ; ($ Cost of feeding + $ Cost of hospital stay for feeding group) less ($ Cost of hospital stay for controls) ; SECONDARY OUTCOME: Delay and dose reductions of chemotherapy. ; All medication administered to the patient is recorded on a Case Report Form for the time period of randomisation through to 1 month following 3rd cycle of chemotherapy postoperatively. ; All medication administered to the patient is recorded on a Case Report Form for the time period of randomisation through to 1 month following 3rd cycle of chemotherapy postoperatively. ; A model will be built that describes cost outcomes for each group, and these will be expressed as probability distributions. The costs of feeding will be recorded for each participant of the intervention arm and either a normal or lognormal distribution fit ed to these data. The length of stay in hospital will be recorded for all participants and gamma distributions fitted for the intervention and the control groups using the method of moments approach. ; Ten thousand random re_samples (bootstrapping) will then be taken from the distributions and the resulting posterior distribution estimated. This technique provides us with robust estimates. This will indicate the mean difference in dollar cost and then the probability that the difference is negative can be calculated. Negative costs imply the intervention is cost saving and positive costs imply the opposite. We assume long term patient outcomes are similar or no worse for feeding, and any adverse event, such as infection, will be captured by longer stays in hospital for the control group. The relevant cost outcome is the opportunity cost of a bed day and this can be valued in dollar terms outside of any statistical processes. Valuations will be informed by observing current levels of expenditure on hospital services by state health services, these data can be obtained easily from routine data published by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. ; Start and finish dates for postoperative chemotherapy is recorded on Case Report Forms and entered onto the trial database. Trial Coordinators access medical correspondence regarding start times for chemotherapy and any reasons for delays in commencement of chemotherapy will be recorded. Medical notes for the duration of the chemotherapy schedule are accessed along with the dosages of chemotherapy given with each cycle. Any reasons for dosage reductions or interruptions to chemotherapy administration are noted on Case Report Forms. Intravenous treatment requirements. ; Intravenous treatments are ordered on medication sheets and then this information is transcribed onto the Case Report Form by the Trial Coordinator and then entered onto the trial database. Length of stay in an Intensive Care Unit or High Dependency Unit and overall lengh of stay in hospital. Need for inotropic medication. ; Inotropic medication _ given to support patient blood pressure and kidney function _ is typically given during the surgery or day 1 or 2 postoperatively. These medications are ordered on medication sheets and then this information is transcribed onto the Case Report Form by the Trial Coordinator and then entered onto the trial database. Nutritional status 6 weeks after surgery. ; ; Scored patient_generated subjective global assessment (PG_SGA) ; The scored PG_SGA is also a validated nutritional assessment tool and has been specifically developed for patients with cancer. The tool consists of a medical history component, which provides information about weight change, dietary intake, gastrointestinal symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea that have persisted for two weeks) and changes in functional capacity. Loss of subcutaneous fat, muscle wasting, oedema and ascites will be considered in the physical examination. Based on the global assessment, the patient will be classified as category A (well nourished), category B (moderately or suspected malnourished) or category C (severely malnourished). In addition to the global ratings, the scored PG_SGA also incorporates a numerical score (PG_SGA score). For the overall PG_SGA score all point values for each section (patients history, physical examination) of the PG_SGA will be added. The additive PG_SGA score ranges from 0 to 50 with a higher score reflecting a greater risk of malnutrition. The PG_SGA score also provides cut_off scores for appropriate nutritional triage and intervention to improve symptom management. The PG_SGA has been accepted by the Oncology Nutrition Dietetic Practice Group of the American Dietetic Association as the standard for nutrition assessment for patients with cancer. Treatment related adverse events. ; Any adverse change in health or side effect that occurs in a participant in this clinical trial while they are receiving enteral feeds, or from the the day of randomisation and up to one month after their third cycle of chemotherapy will be recorded. ; Any event not present prior to treatment or any event already present that worsens in intensity or frequency will be recorded on a Case Report Form and graded in severity using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0. ; Adverse events will be documented at each study visit. Patients will be questioned regarding medically related change in their condition, and information will be gathered from data collected or communication with doctors or hospitals. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients requiring planned upfront or interval cytoreductive surgery for suspected or histologically proven advanced ovarian, primary peritoneal cancer or fallopian tube cancer as determined jointly by the surgeon and the patient. Signs of moderate or severe malnutrition. Patient Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG_SGA) category B or C Medically fit for cytoreductive surgery Signed written informed consent form Females aged 18 years or older Able to understand and complete questionnaires in English"
Actrn	Hydromorphone as an adjuvant induction agent in reducing rocuronium induced pain and hemodynamic changes during tracheal intubation	2010		CN-02443181	"INTERVENTION: Groups are divided according to the pretreatment drugs : (a)hydromorphone (hydromorphone group), (b) fentanyl (fentanyl group) or (c) normal saline (normal saline group) During preoxygenation with 100% oxygen, the study drug was injected over 30 sec and an investigator blinded to the study drug observed the signs of side effects, such as apnea or coughing, for 30 sec. The study drugs were 5 ml of either intravenous (IV) hydromorphone hydrochloride 2 mg (Dilid registered trademark, Ha Na Phram, Seoul, Korea; hydromorphone group, n = 65) or intravenous (IV) fentanyl citrate 100 microgram (Gu Ju Pharm, Seoul, Korea; fentanyl group, n = 67) or intravenous (IV) normal saline (sodium chloride, Joong Wae Pharm, Seoul, Korea; saline group, n = 62).Then 2.5% thiopental sodium 5 mg/kg was injected over 5 sec. After the loss of consciousness and eyelash reflexes, when the appropriate end tidal carbon dioxide curve appeared on capnography upon trial of mask ventilation with the fraction of oxygen ratio (FiO2) 1.0, rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg was injected over 5 sec. The time interval between the study drug injection and rocuronium injection was set to be < 90 sec in all patients. Two anesthesiologists, one who administered the study drug and another to conduct the anesthetic induction, assessed the patient response during and immediately after rocuronium injection in a double_blinded manner. The two investigators were educated beforehand to grade the patient response according to the scale proposed by Shevchenko and colleagues 12: 1 = no movement, 2 = movement at the wrist only, 3 = movement/withdrawal involving the arm only (elbow/shoulder), 4 = generalized response, withdrawal or movement in more than one extremity. Sevoflurane was started after the rocuronium injection and was adjusted to maintain an end_tidal concentration of 2.5_3.0 vol% in 100% oxygen. Two minutes after the rocuronium injection, the anesthesiologist who had more than 4 yearsÕ experience of anesthetic practice performed tracheal intubation and applied controlled ventilation in order to maintain normocarbia without ballooning the cuff for 1 min to avoid stimulation. The patient movement and the status of vocal cord relaxation were observed during tracheal intubation. Anaesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane (end_tidal concentration of 2_3 vol%). The time interval between the study drug injection and intubation was designed to be within three to four minutes in all patients. The intubation time, which was defined as the time from mouth opening to obtaining the appropriate capnographic trace, was measured in all patients. The mean arterial pressure and heart rate were measured upon arrival at the operating room, 1 min before and after tracheal intubation. If there was an increase of heart rate (> 40% in baseline) and/or increased blood pressure with ST change in electrocardiogram after intubation, the administration of IV esmolol (0.3 mg/kg) was available. CONDITION: hemodynamic stability during induction nil rocuronium induced pain PRIMARY OUTCOME: Reduction in rocuronium induced withdrawal movement. The two investigators were educated beforehand to grade the patient response according to the scale proposed by Shevchenko and colleagues 12: 1 = no movement, 2 = movement at the wrist only, 3 = movement/withdrawal involving the arm only (elbow/shoulder), 4 = generalized response, withdrawal or movement in more than one extremity. SECONDARY OUTCOME: attenuation of hemodynamic profile (Mean arterial pressure, MAP.

Actrn	A randomised comparison of AMBU (Registered Trademark) AuraGainTM & LMA Supreme TM in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery under general anaesthesia	2016		CN-01883065	"INTERVENTION: Use of the AMBU AuraGain laryngeal mask in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery under general anaesthesia The AMBU AuraGain laryngeal mask is a new phthalate_free, laryngeal mask device launched in June 2014. Both devices are similar in their fundamental design ie. anatomically curved airway tube, single_use disposable product, with a built_in gastric access port where an orogastric catheter can be inserted to suck out gastric contents and secretions, thereby enhancing patient safety when they undergo positive pressure ventilation. Laryngeal mask airways are inserted routinely for short surgeries as a means to maintain a patent airway to allow the patient to remain ventilated and oxygenated by an anaesthetic ventilator during surgery. Insertion of device will be performed by 1 specialist anaesthetists (Principal Investigators) and 2 senior anaesthesia residents with at least 3 years experience, and at least 10 LMA Supreme & 10 AuraGain insertions in patients with normal airways before trial commencement; supervised by the Principal Investigator. A maximum of 3 attempts at insertion of the laryngeal mask device is allowed. CONDITION: difficult airway PRIMARY OUTCOME: oropharyngeal leak pressure (OLP) ; The oropharyngeal leak pressure is measured by closing the Adjustable Pressure Limiting valve of the circle system (of the anaesthesia machine) at a fixed gas flow of 3 L/min in manual ventilation mode. The oropharyngeal leak pressure is the pressure in the circuit when an audible noise was heard over the mouth. For safety concerns, the maximal allowable oropharyngeal leak pressure was 40cmH2O and auscultation over epigastrium is done at the same time to rule out air leak into stomach during measurement.

Actrn	Effect of an 8-week free pre-prepared meals and prescribed exercise on weight loss in obese and overweight individuals: the Healthy Eating And Living Study (HEALS) randomized controlled trial	2018		CN-01904838	"INTERVENTION: In this study participants will be randomized to either a meals and exercise condition or nutritional information and exercise condition. The intervention will run for 8 weeks with assessments of body composition (DEXA), cardio_respiratory fitness (VO2max), hematological functioning (total cholesterol, HDL_C, LDL_C, Triglycerides, C_reactive protein and Adiponectin), blood pressure and psychosocial health (DASS21 & SF12) pre_ and post_intervention. The intervention group will be provided with prepared meals for the duration of the intervention whereas the control group will be provided with standard information on healthy eating (according to NHMRC guidelines). Both will be provided with an exercise program by personal trainers consisting of resistance and aerobic exercise. This will include 3 gym sessions per week which include exercises at 75% of max HR and weight training between 60 and 85 of 1 RM (exercises include but are not limited to squats, bench press, leg curls, shoulder pull; the aim is to train all muscle groups within the body).. The sessions will be approximately 45 minutes in duration and include a short warm_up and warm_down with stretching exercises. The participants will also be advised to engage in walking on 2 additional days for 30 minutes on each day. In the first 2 weeks gym exercises are with a personal trainer whereas in the remaining 6 weeks there is 1 session with the personal trainer. All participants will receive a manual with exercises for the 8 weeks (weekly program). There are 3 gym sessions whereas the other activities can be done from home/work place. In terms of the meals, participants in the experimental arm will be provided with 3 meals per day as well as snacks. The food provided to the experimental group varies according to the exercise program it accompanies. For example, it will include post_exercise snacks on days when there is structured exercise but not on other days. On average the participants will receive about 2000 calories per day of a high fat low carb diet (fat up to 65%, protein 30% and carbs 5%). Examples include: Roast chicken breast with carrots and greens, beef cheeks with broccoli and cauliflower rice;; Snacks include protein bars, almond and chia.; breakfast Granola. The participants will be required to keep a log book as well as send a weekly audio or video blog to the research team. The blog is based on predetermined questions..

Actrn	Use of high flow nasal oxygen in bariatric surgery: a randomised controlled trial	2018		CN-01908390	"INTERVENTION: After manually oxygenating the patient to an end_tidal oxygen concentration (FEO2) of 0.9 via bag_mask_ventilation, oxygen will be administered via the Optiflow THRIVE device, at a flow rate of 50_70LPM as tolerated, humidified using the Fisher and Paykel 850 humidifier, to a humidity of 70% relative humidity. The oxygen concentration delivered from the device will be 100%, but the actual inspired oxygen concentration will vary with the degree of air entrainment. Pre_operatively an arterial line will be inserted for baseline and post_apnoea arterial blood gas analysis and blood pressure measurement. Arterial line insertion and invasive blood pressure monitoring is current practice in our institution in the management of an obese patient due to the lack of reliability of non_invasive blood pressure measurements in this population. Additionally, the use of an arterial line allows for repeated blood samples to be taken without exposing the patient to repeated skin puncture. Induction of anaesthesia will be conducted with alfentanil or fentanyl, propofol and rocuronium 1mg/kg of calculated lean body weight. Maintenance of anaesthesia during the period of data collection will be via intravenous propofol infusion. The patient will be ventilated with bag mask ventilation and the treating anaesthetist will perform gentle laryngoscopy with a CMAC video laryngoscope when the patient is pharmacologically paralysed. Laryngoscopy will take approximately 60 seconds. If the patient is judged to be an easy bag_mask ventilation and Cormack_Lehane laryngoscopy grade I or II, the laryngoscope will be removed and the patient will be bag_mask ventilated to an end_tidal oxygen of 90%. Once this target it reached, Optiflow THRIVE will be applied to the patient, an adequately sized an oropharyngeal airway inserted and airway manoeuvres (chin lift, head tilt, jaw thrust) performed to ensure airway patency. The patient will remain anaesthetised and apnoeic until an SpO2 of 95% or a time of six minutes is reached. At this point Optiflow THRIVE will be removed and the patient manually bag mask ventilated until SpO2 of 98% is achieved, and the patient will be intubated. During the period of apnoeic oxygenation, anaesthesia will be maintained with a propofol infusion. The intervention will only be performed once during the trial, for a maximum time period of 6 minutes. The procedure will be performed by a specialist anaesthetist with at least 5 years of anaesthetic experience, or by an anaesthetic trainee with a consultant anaesthetist present. The trial will occur at a tertiary hospital. The trial will be performed under direct supervision by the research practitioner in order to ensure that the intervention and control groups are being adhered to. CONDITION: Airway management Apnoeic oxygenation Obesity PRIMARY OUTCOME: Rate of rise of PaCO2 _ PaCO2 measured using arterial blood sampling after ETO2 0.9 reached and then re_measured when SpO2 is less than 95% or 6 minutes, whichever occurs first. The difference in PaCO2 is then divided by the duration of apnoea to give a rate of rise of PaCO2 mmHg/min. Rate of rise of transcutaneous CO2 _ TcCO2 measured using transcutanoues CO2 monitor after ETO2 0.9 reached and then re_measured when SpO2 is less than 95% or 6 minutes, whichever occurs first.

"M. Adrianzen Vargas, N. Cassinello Fernandez and J. Ortega Serrano"	Preoperative weight loss in patients with indication of bariatric surgery: which is the best method?	2011			"Surgery is the only effective treatment for people with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 40 Kg/m2 or even greater than 35 Kg/m2 when some diseases like diabetes or hypertension appear. In order to minimize surgical risk and improve postoperative results, preoperative preparation it's very important. ""Acute"" preoperative weight loss just before surgery plays a crucial role in that preparation and can be achieved through different ways like a low calorie diet, a very low calorie diet or with the use of an intragastric balloon. The advantages or particularities of every one of them will be summarized in this article. Literature review of the benefits, risks and complications of preoperative weight loss through a low calorie diet, a very low calorie diet or intragastric balloon placement. Seven of thirteen initially selected reports from Medline search were considered relevant, including a total 371 patients (240 patients treated with low calorie diet, 90 with very low calorie diet and 41 cases of intragastric balloon placement). We found that weight loss was greater in patients with very low calorie diets and intragastric balloon groups but with a slightly increase in morbidity and cost. Although there are no comparative studies, data from the literature results show that diets very low in calories are more effective and require less time than low-calorie diets and cheaper with fewer side effects than the intragastric balloon."

In the past, obesity was considered a contraindication to laparoscopy due to the higher risk of co-morbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease and venous thromboembolism. Performing laparoscopic gynaecological procedures in morbidly obese patients is no longer a rare phenomenon; however, it does necessitate changes in clinical practice patterns. Understanding of the physiological changes induced by laparoscopy, particularly in obese patients, is important so that these may be counteracted and adverse outcomes avoided. Laparoscopy in obese patients confers certain advantages such as shorter hospital stay, less post-operative pain and fewer wound infections. In addition to these benefits, minimal-access surgery has been demonstrated as safe and effective in obese patients; however, specific surgical strategies and operative techniques may need to be adopted.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"S. Aggarwal, A. P. Sharma and N. Ramaswamy"	Outcome of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with and without staple line oversewing in morbidly obese patients: a randomized study	2013	https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/lap.2013.0137		"INTRODUCTION: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a popular bariatric procedure with a low complication rate. Serious complications after LSG include gastric leak and staple line bleeding. In order to reduce these complications, staple line reinforcement has been practiced variably by many surgeons. There is no conclusive evidence to suggest that routine oversewing of the staple line or reinforcement with buttressing material after LSG decreases these complications. We therefore undertook a prospective randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of oversewing of the staple line in preventing complications after LSG., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty patients undergoing LSG were randomly allocated to two groups. In Group A, the entire staple line was reinforced with continuous suturing, and in Group B, no reinforcement was used. Thirty patients were enrolled in each group. Indications for this procedure were morbidly obese (body mass index >=40 kg/m(2)) or severely obese (body mass index >=35 kg/m(2)) patients with comorbidities including type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, sleep apnea, and osteoarthritis. Complications including gastric leak, bleeding, and stricture were recorded., RESULTS: The demographic parameters were comparable in the two groups. Two cases of early gastric leak occurred in Group B and none in Group A. There was no case of staple line bleeding or stricture in either group, although 1 patient in Group B had bleeding from the omentum that required re-operation. The overall surgical complication rate was 5%. The mean operative time in Group A (139+/-10 minutes) was significantly greater than in Group B (117+/-19 minutes) (P=.02)., CONCLUSIONS: Oversewing of the staple line may lead to reduction in leak rate, although a larger study is required to reach a definitive conclusion. The incidence of staple line bleeding can be minimized by following meticulous technique and adequate compression time after closure of the stapler rather than placing undue emphasis on oversewing and expensive buttressing materials."

The aim of this cost-effectiveness analysis was to evaluate the economic impact of these weight loss treatments for IIH., METHODS: IIH:WT was a five-year randomised, controlled, parallel group, multicentre trial in the United Kingdom, where participants with active IIH and a body mass index >=35 kg/m2 were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive access to bariatric surgery or a community weight management intervention. All clinical and quality of life data was recorded at baseline, 12 and 24 months. Economic evaluation was performed to assess health-care costs and cost-effectiveness. Evaluations were established on an intention to treat principle, followed by a sensitivity analysis using a per protocol analysis., RESULTS: The mean total health care costs were GBP 1353 for the community weight management arm and GBP 5400 for the bariatric surgery arm over 24 months. The majority of costs for the bariatric surgery arm relate to the surgical procedure itself. The 85% who underwent bariatric surgery achieved a 12.5% reduction in intracranial pressure at 24 months as compared to 39% in the community weight management arm; a mean difference of 45% in favour of bariatric surgery. The cost effectiveness of bariatric surgery improved over time., CONCLUSIONS: The IIH:WT was the first to compare the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery with community weight management interventions in the setting of a randomised control trial. The cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery improved over time and therefore the incremental cost of surgery when offset against the incremental reduction of intracranial pressure improved after 24 months, as compared with 12 months follow up."

However, the prevalence, pathophysiology and long-term outcomes have not been well described. Therefore, we sought to summarize evidence of orthostatic intolerance after bariatric surgery. We conducted a systematic review using PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to identify relevant articles from the date of inception until 1st April 2020. Study selection, data extraction and quality assessment of the included studies were performed independently by two reviewers. The findings of the included studies were narratively reported. When feasible, a meta-analysis was done to summarize the relevant results. We included 20 studies (n = 19 843 participants) reporting findings of 12 prospective cohort studies, 5 retrospective cohort studies, 2 cross-sectional studies and one randomized controlled trial. The 5-year cumulative incidence of orthostatic intolerance was 4.2% (one study). Common clinical presentations of orthostatic intolerance were lightheadedness, dizziness, syncope and palpitation. The pooled data suggested improvement in overall cardiac autonomic function (sympathetic and parasympathetic) post-bariatric surgery. In addition, a significant systolic blood pressure drop may reflect a reset of the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems after weight loss in the pooled analysis. Existing literature on orthostatic intolerance post-bariatric surgeries was limited or of low quality, and larger studies are needed to know the true incidence of orthostatic intolerance post-bariatric surgeries and the pathophysiology. We found one study reporting the 5-years cumulative incidence of orthostatic intolerance post-bariatric surgeries as only 4.2%. This could challenge the idea of increased orthostatic intolerance prevalence post-bariatric surgeries.

Inclusion criteria were renal and upper ureteral stones. Exclusion criteria were uncorrectable bleeding disorders, active urinary tract infection, and pregnancy., RESULTS: Both the groups were comparable regarding the male/female ratio, stone size, and site. No significant differences were found in terms of the stone-free rate, blood transfusion rate, and complication rates. Significant differences were reported in mean hemoglobin loss (-1.03 and -2.18 g/dL), mean operative time (86.16 and 111.7 minutes), and mean hospital stay (49.88 and 81.2 hours) in the supine and prone positions, respectively, and anesthesiological parameters (the mean blood pressure decreased by 2 and 14.06 mm Hg, the mean heart rate changed by -0.82 and +13.28 beat/minute, and the peak air way pressure changed by +1.08 cm H2O and +7.56 cm H2O in the supine and prone positions, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: PCNL in both positions was equally successful with no significant differences in complications. PCNL in the oblique supine lithotomy position was superior to PCNL in the prone position regarding operative time, hospital stay, and effects on respiratory and cardiovascular status, making it more comfortable for patients and anesthesiologists. Morbidly obese patients, patients with cardiologic disorders, and patients with pulmonary obstructive airway disease need further studies to show if they would benefit from these differences. Additionally, it is more comfortable for the surgeon with little challenges added in the initial puncture."

Methods: Prospective randomized study included 60 obese patients who underwent Laparoscopic MGB surgery between March 2016 and March 2018 and assigned into two groups, Group I underwent Standard MGB and Group II underwent single anastomosis Gastric bypass with fixed common channel length of 300 cm. Results: Both groups have satisfactory EWL; however, EWL is steadier in group II, Mean percentage of EWL reported after one year was 67% ± 6 in Group I while in Group II was 70% ± 1.47 with (Pvalue 0.453). With less incidence of nutritional deficiencies in_group II. Both groups have significant improvement of preoperative co morbidities. for instance: (36.7%) of Group I and (50%) of group II showed improvement of their diabetes status ( p_value 0.297) and about 33.3% of Both Group I& II showed improvement of their blood pressure. In addition, Malodorous flatus affecting social life was more frequent in_group II than in group I with (P_value 0.001); however, this has not affected their quality of life estimated by BAROS. Conclusion: In performing single anastomosis Gastric bypass with fixed common channel length achieves satisfactory maintained EWL with less possible metabolic complications."

Bariatric surgery has been shown to be the most effective method for weight reduction. However, no conclusive data exists on the effects of weight reduction surgery on NAFLD. This study aimed to characterize liver histology, metabolic status, and liver function changes in patients who underwent bariatric surgery, before and after the weight-reduction procedure. This is a phase 1 report of a prospective cohort study of patients who underwent bariatric surgery. Biopsies were obtained at baseline (intraoperatively) and 3 months postoperatively. Clinical characteristics, biochemical profile, and histopathological data [steatosis, NAFLD activity score (NAS), hepatocyte ballooning, lobular inflammation, and degree of fibrosis] were obtained at each time point. Twenty-seven patients were included (9 men and 18 women), and the median age was 35 +/- 8 years old. At baseline, 3 patients had dyslipidemia, 4 had diabetes, and 5 patients had hypertension, which did not change at follow-up. The average body mass index decreased from 44.6 +/- 7.8 to 34.2 +/- 6.3 kg/m2 at follow-up (P < 0.001). On histopathology, 12 of the 18 patients with preoperative steatosis (median score 2) had reduced steatosis scores postoperatively (P = 0.025); fibrosis (median score 1) was also reduced in 17 patients (P = 0.012), and NAS was decreased from 4 (3-5) to 2 (1-3) (P = 0.004). The changes in lobular inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning were not statistically significant on follow-up. The phase 1 results of this study described the histopathological changes following weight reduction surgery and suggested that hepatic steatosis, fibrosis, and NAFLD activity score were reduced 3 months after surgery. This clinical trial is financially supported by the National Plan for Science, Technology and Innovation Program grant number (11-MED1910-02)."

Sixteen subjects without (group I) and sixteen subjects with a truncal vagotomy (group II), were given a daily diet of 18 mmol of sodium for 5 days (D1ÐD5). The sodium deficit for this period was calculated for each subject and on the morning of day_6 (D6), their cumulative deficit (E) was given as 3% NaCl. In both groups the subjects were divided to receive the hypertonic saline either orally (Ior, IIor) or intravenously (Iiv, IIiv). During the period of low sodium diet when compared to group II subjects of group I (1) had a greater weight loss (p < 0.005), (2) demonstrated a larger drop in pulse pressure (p < 0.005), (3) achieved a positive sodium equilibrium later (D5 vs D4) and (4) developed a greater sodium deficit (p < 0.005). During the two 12 h periods of D6, both Ior and Iiv exhibited greater natriuresis during the first 12 h period (p < 0.0001) whereas both IIor and IIiv did so during the second 12 h period (p < 0.0001). On D6 Ior excreted the greatest percentage of E (E%; 35.63% ± 3.12%, p < 0.0001) compared to Iiv (17.06% ± 1.78%), IIor (16.03% ± 3.54%) and IIiv (15.39% ± 2.77%) whereas E% was not different between the other subgroups. These results indicate that the differential natriuresis between oral and intravenous sodium loading in previously sodium deprived subjects, is due to a mechanism in which the vagal nerves play a significant role as part of neural reflex or via a natriuretic hormone."

Objectives: The present study aimed at comparing the effects of liberal and restrictive fluid therapy on renal indices in laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery. Methods: In a double_blinded randomized clinical trial, 72 candidates of bariatric surgery were randomly assigned into two groups of restrictive and liberal fluid therapy. Indices, including BUN, creatinine, creatine kinase, GFR, and urine output were measured before and 24 hours after the surgery. The clinical trial was registered at IRCT.ir under code IRCT20170109031852N3. Results: There was no significant difference in BUN, creatinine, creatinine kinase, and GFR indices between the two groups of liberal and restrictive fluid therapy both before and 24 hours after surgery (P > 0.05). Intragroup comparisons before and after surgery revealed that BUN decreased in both groups after the surgery (P < 0.05). Also, creatinine and GFR values improved in patients who received a liberal fluid regimen, whereas these indices remained statistically unchanged in the restrictive group before and 24 hours after the surgery (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Two methods of liberal and restrictive fluid therapy have comparable effects on traditional renal functional indices in laparoscopic bariatric surgery. The clinical significance of observed differences in outcomes should be investigated in further studies. The use of early biomarkers of acute kidney injury is warranted."

Wells	Surgery for obesity: A systematic review and network meta-analysis	2014	https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11695-014-1292-0		"Introduction: Obesity is the fifth leading cause of global deaths. The efficacy and safety of obesity treatment are still controversial. Objective(s): To assess the efficacy and safety of bariatric surgery, in modifying clinically important outcomes such as weight and comorbidities including diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea. Method(s): Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from January 1950 to September 2010, comparing different surgical procedures, or surgical to nonsurgical treatment in adolescents and adults, who fulfill the definition of obesity, were included. Percentage of excess weight loss, body mass index, weight loss in kilograms, resolution or improvement of obesity related comorbidities, and safety were evaluated. Direct and indirect comparison models were applied. Result(s): Nineteen RCTs with 1,346 participants were included. Bariatric surgery resulted in greater weight loss when compared to nonsurgical treatment. Weight loss was also associated with resolution and/or improvement of the obesity related comorbidities. Weight loss varied across the surgical procedures, where malabsorptive procedures such as biliopancreatic diversion/duodenal switch had the greatestweight loss, followed by sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Purely restrictive procedures such as vertical banded gastroplasty and adjustable gastric banding resulted in the least weight loss and were associated with greater risk of reoperations as well as conversion to other types of bariatric surgery procedures.Malabsorptive procedures led to more early complications when compared to others. Conclusion(s): Bariatric surgery is more effective than nonsurgical treatment for obesity. The safety and efficacy varied across the surgical procedures. Longterm, high-quality and adequately powered trials are still needed to support the available evidence."

Muggia-Sullam"	Morbidly obese patients are hemodynamically stable during laparoscopic surgery: a thoracic bioimpedance study	2006			"PURPOSE: Morbid obesity caries an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and might be associated with intraoperative hemodynamic instability. Based on clinical observation, we hypothesized that during laparoscopic surgery, morbidly obese patients behave hemodynamically similar to the nonobese patients and remain hemodynamically stable., METHODS: In a prospective trial, thirty nonobese and tthirty morbidly obese (BMI > or = 35 kg/m(2)) patients scheduled for elective laparoscopic surgery were assigned to receive standard balanced anesthesia. We aimed at equianesthetic levels by keeping the BIS (bispectral index) value between 40-50 throughout surgery. End-tidal isoflurane was measured every 5 min. Noninvasive hemodynamic measurements included cardiac index (CI), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR), recorded every 5 min and at specific predetermined times. Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) was calculated. Episodes of MAP or = 130 mmHg or HR or = 110 bpm occurring throughout surgery and requiring pharmacological intervention were considered main end-points. Additionally, hemodynamic variables were compared at specific time points and overall throughout surgery. Secondary end-points were CI and SVRI., RESULTS: Heart rate was higher in obese patients in head-up position (79 +/- 15 mmHg vs. 65 +/- 12 mmHg - P=0.011). SVR was higher in the nonobese group with head-up position (1978 +/- 665 dynes s cm(-5) vs. 1394 +/- 496 dynes s cm(-5) P=0.01). Mean overall intraoperative MAP, HR, CI and SVR were similar. There were no episodes of MAP or =130 mmHg or HR or =110 bpm in either of the groups., CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed our hypothesis that for the most periods of laparoscopic surgery, obese patients are hemodynamically as stable as their nonobese counterparts."

METHOD(S): A microsimulation model was developed over a lifetime horizon to simulate weight change, cardiometabolic comorbidities status, health consequences and costs of bariatric surgery for morbid obesity. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained were used in the model. Surgical effectiveness was derived from observational studies and randomized clinical trials. Surgical complication rates, adverse events, the remission of cardiometabolic comorbidities, mortality rates, costs, utilities and other model parameters were estimated from publicly available databases and published literature. The discount rate for costs (2016 US dollars) and QALYs was 3%. RESULT(S): Under conservative assumptions, all techniques enhanced health outcomes at lower cost (cost saving) compared to no surgery for patients with cardiometabolic comorbidities (type 2 diabetes, hypertension and or dyslipide-mia). However, bariatric surgery was not cost saving for patients without comorbidities. LRYGB is cost effective with higher QALYs (16.44) and lower cost ($168,927) than LSG (15.74 QALY; $187,587), LAGB (15.08 QALY; $200,539) and no surgery (13.43 QALY; $251,917) for patients with cardiometabolic comorbidities. In addition, LRYGB is cost effective for patients without comorbidities (17.53 QALY; $137,879) compared with LSG (17.16 QALY; $136,041), LAGB (16.68 QALY; $130,971) and no surgery (15.15 QALY; $117,367), having the maximum net monetary benefit (NMB) over a willingness to pay (WTP) range form $0-250,000. Sensitivity analysis showed robustness to reasonable variation in overall model parameters. CONCLUSION(S): All types of bariatric surgeries showed significant weight loss compared to no surgery. LRYGB is the optimal bariatric technique, being cost effective compared with LSG, LAGB and no surgery options."

The CG represented patients with a previous visit to a bariatric surgeon without a subsequent surgery. Cohorts were matched on age, gender, ethnicity, baseline body mass index (BMI), and presence of diabetes and hypertension. Groups were compared in terms of co-morbidities, weight loss, and chronic conditions for three years., RESULTS: A total of 61 313 patients were identified. From these, 14 916 RYGB and 20 867 SG patients were matched to the CG (n = 16 562). The median BMI loss three years after surgery was 28.7% (interquartile range [IQR] 20.8%-36.2%) and 20.5% (IQR 13.5%-28.6%) for RYGB and SG groups, respectively. The CG had a median BMI loss of 6.7% with IQR of 20.4% decrease to 1.78% gain. At three years postoperatively, HbA1C decreased by 13% for RYGB and 5.9% for the SG group. The probabilities of remission from diabetes, hypertension, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly higher among patients who had surgery compared to the CG. For both RYGB and SG, the estimated probabilities of remission were similar., CONCLUSION: This study shows that bariatric surgery performed in the real-world clinical setting is an effective therapy for various expressions of the metabolic syndrome with results that are comparable to randomized control trials.

Current therapies for obesity include lifestyle intervention, bariatric surgery, and pharmacotherapy. The magnitude of weight loss achieved with these therapies can determine the level of improvement in various comorbidities. Once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of obesity. This article reviews data from the global phase 3 Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) program, comparing the efficacy of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo for weight loss and improvements in cardiometabolic parameters across the STEP 1 to 5 trials. In STEP 1 to 3 and STEP 5, semaglutide led to greater reductions from baseline versus placebo in body weight, waist circumference, body mass index, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure, as well as positive changes in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), C-reactive protein, and lipid levels. In STEP 4, all participants had a 20-week run-in period on semaglutide before either continuing on semaglutide or switching to placebo at week 20 in a 2:1 ratio for 48 weeks. At week 68, continued semaglutide led to further reductions from week 20 in HbA1c, improvements in lipid profile, and stabilization of SBP. Overall, across the STEP trials, treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo improved cardiometabolic risk factors associated with obesity, illustrating an effective treatment option for people with overweight (and associated comorbidities) or obesity."
"A. Aminian, J. Kirwan, B. Burguera, S. Brethauer and P. Schauer"	A nationwide safety analysis of bariatric surgery in nonmorbidly obese patients with type 2 diabetes	2015			"Introduction: Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown the superiority of bariatric surgery over medical therapy for achieving glycemic targets in obese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, these RCTs cannot clearly resolve the safety concerns of bariatric surgery in a subgroup of patients with T2D who are overweight and mildly obese because such studies are small trials unlikely to reveal uncommon but clinically serious complications. In addition, many of the trials have screened out low-body mass index (BMI) and high-risk patients deemed unfit for participation in the study. The aim of this study was to assess the safety profile of bariatric surgery in patients with class 1 obesity and overweight with T2D using a large national clinical database. These data are important because most patients with T2D fall into this low BMI category. Method(s): Data were retrieved from the American College of Surgeons - National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) dataset (2005-2013). Inclusion criteria included: adult patients aged >= 18 years, BMI >=25 but <35 kg/m2, who were being treated with medications for T2D and underwent elective primary bariatric surgical procedures including Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), adjustable gastric banding (AGB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG), and duodenal switch (DS). Data of the subgroup of patients with BMI 25-30 were detailed separately, as there is a paucity of such data in the literature. Postoperative composite adverse outcome was defined as presence of any of 16 major adverse events. Result(s): The mean BMI of the 1,003 patients who met the inclusion criteria was 33.5+/-1.6 kg/m2. Forty-six patients had a BMI<30 kg/m2. Forty percent were taking insulin and 60% were on oral hypoglycemic medications. The most prevalent baseline comorbidities were hypertension (77.6%) and cardiac diseases (9.1%). Surgical procedures included RYGB (57.2%), AGB (22.6%), SG (18.8%), and DS (1.3%). The mean operative time and length of hospital stay were 110.3+/-51.6 min and 2.0+/-1.7 days, respectively. Incidence of all individual complications was <= 0.5% in this cohort except postoperative bleeding, which was 1.6%. Thirty-day postoperative mortality and composite adverse event rates were 0.2% and 4.2%, respectively. Reoperation within 30 days after the primary procedure was necessary in 1.6% of patients (Table 1). Conclusion(s): A 2-hour surgical procedure requiring a two day hospital stay that is associated with modest early morbidity (4%) and low mortality (0.2%) can lead to remission of a chronic, progressive and disabling disease. Based on these findings, bariatric surgery can be considered a relatively safe option for managing T2D in patients with mild obesity. Further large clinical studies on long-term safety and efficacy outcomes of bariatric surgery in patients with T2D and low BMI are warranted. (Table Presented)."

Being overweight predisposes patients to multiple serious medical comorbidities including type two diabetes (T2DM), hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea. Lifestyle modifications including diet and exercise produce modest weight reduction and bariatric surgery is the only evidence-based intervention with sustainable results. Biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) produces the most significant weight loss with amelioration of many obesity-related comorbidities compared to other bariatric surgeries; however perioperative morbidity and mortality associated with this surgery are not insignificant; additionally long-term complications including undesirable gastrointestinal side effects and metabolic derangements cannot be ignored. The overall quality of evidence in the literature is low with a lack of randomized control trials, a preponderance of uncontrolled series, and small sample sizes in the studies available. Additionally, when assessing remission of comorbidities, definitions are unclear and variable.

Borrelli"	Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: 5-year results of a prospective randomized trial	2007			"BACKGROUND: To perform a prospective, randomized comparison of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB)., METHODS: LAGB, using the pars flaccida technique, and standard LRYGB were performed. From January 2000 to November 2000, 51 patients (mean age 34.0 +/- 8.9 years, range 20-49) were randomly allocated to undergo either LAGB (n = 27, 5 men and 22 women, mean age 33.3 years, mean weight 120 kg, mean body mass index [BMI] 43.4 kg/m(2); percentage of excess weight loss 83.8%) or LRYGB (n = 24, 4 men and 20 women, mean age 34.7, mean weight 120 kg, mean BMI 43.8 kg/m(2), percentage of excess weight loss 83.3). Data on the operative time, complications, reoperations with hospital stay, weight, BMI, percentage of excess weight loss, and co-morbidities were collected yearly. Failure was considered a BMI of >35 at 5 years postoperatively. The data were analyzed using Student's t test and Fisher's exact test, with P <.05 considered significant., RESULTS: The mean operative time was 60 +/- 20 minutes for the LAGB group and 220 +/- 100 minutes for the LRYGB group (P <.001). One patient in the LAGB group was lost to follow-up. No patient died. Conversion to laparotomy was performed in 1 (4.2%) of 24 LRYGB patients because of a posterior leak of the gastrojejunal anastomosis. Reoperations were required in 4 (15.2%) of 26 LAGB patients, 2 because of gastric pouch dilation and 2 because of unsatisfactory weight loss. One of these patients required conversion to biliopancreatic diversion; the remaining 3 patients were on the waiting list for LRYGB. Reoperations were required in 3 (12.5%) of the 24 LRYGB patients, and each was because of a potentially lethal complication. No LAGB patient required reoperation because of an early complication. Of the 27 LAGB patients, 3 had hypertension and 1 had sleep apnea. Of the 24 LRYGB patients, 2 had hyperlipemia, 1 had hypertension, and 1 had type 2 diabetes. Five years after surgery, the diabetes, sleep apnea, and hyperlipemia had resolved. At the 5-year (range 60-66 months) follow-up visit, the LRYGB patients had significantly lower weight and BMI and a greater percentage of excess weight loss than did the LAGB patients. Weight loss failure (BMI >35 kg/m(2) at 5 yr) was observed in 9 (34.6%) of 26 LAGB patients and in 1 (4.2%) of 24 LRYGB patients (P <.001). Of the 26 patients in the LAGB group and 24 in the LRYGB group, 3 (11.5%) and 15 (62.5%) had a BMI of <30 kg/m(2), respectively (P <.001)., CONCLUSION: The results of our study have shown that LRYGB results in better weight loss and a reduced number of failures compared with LAGB, despite the significantly longer operative time and life-threatening complications."
Anonymous	Polysomnography in patients with obstructive sleep apnea: an evidence-based analysis	2006			"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this health technology policy assessment was to evaluate the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of sleep studies in Ontario., CLINICAL NEED: TARGET POPULATION AND CONDITION Sleep disorders are common and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the predominant type. Obstructive sleep apnea is the repetitive complete obstruction (apnea) or partial obstruction (hypopnea) of the collapsible part of the upper airway during sleep. The syndrome is associated with excessive daytime sleepiness or chronic fatigue. Several studies have shown that OSA is associated with hypertension, stroke, and other cardiovascular disorders; many researchers believe that these cardiovascular disorders are consequences of OSA. This has generated increasing interest in recent years in sleep studies., THE TECHNOLOGY BEING REVIEWED: There is no 'gold standard' for the diagnosis of OSA, which makes it difficult to calibrate any test for diagnosis. Traditionally, polysomnography (PSG) in an attended setting (sleep laboratory) has been used as a reference standard for the diagnosis of OSA. Polysomnography measures several sleep variables, one of which is the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) or respiratory disturbance index (RDI). The AHI is defined as the sum of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep; apnea is defined as the absence of airflow for >= 10 seconds; and hypopnea is defined as reduction in respiratory effort with >= 4% oxygen desaturation. The RDI is defined as the sum of apneas, hypopneas, and abnormal respiratory events per hour of sleep. Often the two terms are used interchangeably. The AHI has been widely used to diagnose OSA, although with different cut-off levels, the basis for which are often unclear or arbitrarily determined. Generally, an AHI of more than five events per hour of sleep is considered abnormal and the patient is considered to have a sleep disorder. An abnormal AHI accompanied by excessive daytime sleepiness is the hallmark for OSA diagnosis. For patients diagnosed with OSA, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is the treatment of choice. Polysomnography may also used for titrating CPAP to individual needs. In January 2005, the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario published the second edition of Independent Health Facilities: Clinical Practice Parameters and Facility Standards: Sleep Medicine, commonly known as ""The Sleep Book."" The Sleep Book states that OSA is the most common primary respiratory sleep disorder and a full overnight sleep study is considered the current standard test for individuals in whom OSA is suspected (based on clinical signs and symptoms), particularly if CPAP or surgical therapy is being considered. Polysomnography in a sleep laboratory is time-consuming and expensive. With the evolution of technology, portable devices have emerged that measure more or less the same sleep variables in sleep laboratories as in the home. Newer CPAP devices also have auto-titration features and can record sleep variables including AHI. These devices, if equally accurate, may reduce the dependency on sleep laboratories for the diagnosis of OSA and the titration of CPAP, and thus may be more cost-effective. Difficulties arise, however, when trying to assess and compare the diagnostic efficacy of in-home PSG versus in-lab. The AHI measured from portable devices in-home is the sum of apneas and hypopneas per hour of time in bed, rather than of sleep, and the absolute diagnostic efficacy of in-lab PSG is unknown. To compare in-home PSG with in-lab PSG, several researchers have used correlation coefficients or sensitivity and specificity, while others have used Bland-Altman plots or receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. All these approaches, however, have potential pitfalls. Correlation coefficients do not measure agreement; sensitivity and specificity are not helpful when the true disease status is unknown; and Bland-Altman plots measure agreement (but are helpful when the range of clinical equivalence is known). Lastly, receiver operating characteristics curves are generated using logistic regression with the true disease status as the dependent variable and test values as the independent variable. Thus, each value of the test is used as a cut-point to measure sensitivity and specificity, which are then plotted on an x-y plane. The cut-point that maximizes both sensitivity and specificity is chosen as the cut-off level to discriminate between disease and no-disease states. In the absence of a gold standard to determine the true disease status, ROC curves are of minimal value. At the request of the Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee (OHTAC), MAS has thus reviewed the literature on PSG published over the last two years to examine new developments., METHODS:, REVIEW STRATEGY: There is a large body of literature on sleep studies and several reviews have been conducted. Two large cohort studies, the Sleep Heart Health Study and the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study, are the main sources of evidence on sleep literature. To examine new developments on PSG published in the past two years, MEDLINE, EMBASE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Cochrane CENTRAL, INAHTA, and websites of other health technology assessment agencies were searched. Any study that reported results of in-home or in-lab PSG was included. All articles that reported findings from the Sleep Heart Health Study and the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study were also reviewed. DIFFUSION OF SLEEP LABORATORIES: To estimate the diffusion of sleep laboratories, a list of sleep laboratories licensed under the Independent Health Facility Act was obtained. The annual number of sleep studies per 100,000 individuals in Ontario from 2000 to 2004 was also estimated using administrative databases., SUMMARY OF FINDINGS:, LITERATURE REVIEW: A total of 315 articles were identified that were published in the past two years; 227 were excluded after reviewing titles and abstracts. A total of 59 articles were identified that reported findings of the Sleep Heart Health Study and the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study., PREVALENCE: Based on cross-sectional data from the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study of 602 men and women aged 30 to 60 years, it is estimated that the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing is 9% in women and 24% in men, on the basis of more than five AHI events per hour of sleep. Among the women with sleep disorder breathing, 22.6% had daytime sleepiness and among the men, 15.5% had daytime sleepiness. Based on this, the prevalence of OSA in the middle-aged adult population is estimated to be 2% in women and 4% in men. Snoring is present in 94% of OSA patients, but not all snorers have OSA. Women report daytime sleepiness less often compared with their male counterparts (of similar age, body mass index [BMI], and AHI). Prevalence of OSA tends to be higher in older age groups compared with younger age groups. DIAGNOSTIC VALUE OF POLYSOMNOGRAPHY: It is believed that PSG in the sleep laboratory is more accurate than in-home PSG. In the absence of a gold standard, however, claims of accuracy cannot be substantiated. In general, there is poor correlation between PSG variables and clinical variables. A variety of cut-off points of AHI (> 5, > 10, and > 15) are arbitrarily used to diagnose and categorize severity of OSA, though the clinical importance of these cut-off points has not been determined. Recently, a study of the use of a therapeutic trial of CPAP to diagnose OSA was reported. The authors studied habitual snorers with daytime sleepiness in the absence of other medical or psychiatric disorders. Using PSG as the reference standard, the authors calculated the sensitivity of this test to be 80% and its specificity to be 97%. Further, they concluded that PSG could be avoided in 46% of this population. OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA AND OBESITY: Obstructive sleep apnea is strongly associated with obesity. Obese individuals (BMI >30 kg/m(2)) are at higher risk for OSA compared with non-obese individuals and up to 75% of OSA patients are obese. It is hypothesized that obese individuals have large deposits of fat in the neck that cause the upper airway to collapse in the supine position during sleep. The observations reported from several studies support the hypothesis that AHIs (or RDIs) are significantly reduced with weight loss in obese individuals. OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES: Associations have been shown between OSA and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension, which are known risk factors for myocardial infarction and stroke. Patients with more severe forms of OSA (based on AHI) report poorer quality of life and increased health care utilization compared with patients with milder forms of OSA. From animal models, it is hypothesized that sleep fragmentation results in glucose intolerance and hypertension. There is, however, no evidence from prospective studies in humans to establish a causal link between OSA and hypertension or diabetes mellitus. It is also not clear that the associations between OSA and other diseases are independent of obesity; in most of these studies, patients with higher values of AHI had higher values of BMI compared with patients with lower AHI values. A recent meta-analysis of bariatric surgery has shown that weight loss in obese individuals (mean BMI = 46.8 kg/m(2); range = 32.30-68.80) significantly improved their health profile. Diabetes was resolved in 76.8% of patients, hypertension was resolved in 61.7% of patients, hyperlipidemia improved in 70% of patients, and OSA resolved in 85.7% of patients. This suggests that obesity leads to OSA, diabetes, and hypertension, rather than OSA independently causing diabetes and hypertension. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)"

Anonymous	Hepatic Vagotomy in Obese Patients Leads to Improvement of the Cholesterol to HDL Ratio	2022	https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2022.06.146		"Anna Catinis New Orleans LA1, Claudia Leonardi Hammond LA2, Michael Cook New Orleans LA3 LSU School of Medicine1 LSU Health Sciences Center2 Louisiana State University3 Background: The obesity epidemic is rapidly growing, and visceral adiposity is associated with metabolic consequences secondary to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-induced inter-organ signaling pathways. PPARs are ligand-activated transcription factors that modulate vagal pathways which can improve blood pressure, arterial remodeling, cholesterol levels, and insulin sensitivity. However, an obesity-induced inflammatory milieu can interfere with the beneficial effects of PPAR activity, suggesting that a dysregulated PPAR-vagus pathway may play a role in the pathogenesis of obesity-related hypertension. Therefore, we hypothesized that hepatic vagotomy (HV) in patients with obesity would result in a significant reduction in blood pressure and/or the number of hypertension medications compared to control. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective chart review of 160 patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Patients were divided into HV and control groups, and information was collected at each clinic visit. Result(s): At six-months post-operation, the HV group was found to have significantly lower total cholesterol (TC)/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratios than the control group. The HV group also had a numerically better blood profile for TC, HDL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides, C-reactive protein, and LDL/HDL ratio. Hypertensive patients in the HV group showed numerically lower hypertension medication counts after six weeks when compared to control. Conclusion(s): We present the first study to report clinically significant changes related to HV in human subjects. Our results did not support our initial hypothesis, but did demonstrate an improvement of the TC/HDL ratio with HV in patients with obesity. Future studies should confirm these findings in a randomized control trial.Copyright © 2022"

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of these SNPs on changes in serum resistin levels, biochemical parameters and weight after biliopancreatic diversion surgery in morbidly obese patients without diabetes mellitus. Methods A sample of 155 patients with morbid obesity without diabetes mellitus was enrolled. Anthropometric and biochemical evaluations were realized at the basal visit and at 12 months. The percentage of subjects with hypertension and hyperlipidemia was also reported. Results Initial percentage excess weight loss, body mass index, weight, waist circumference, fat mass, blood pressure, low_density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides levels, insulin and the homeostasis model assessment for insulin sensitivity (HOMA_IR) improve after 12 months. No differences in these improvements were detected between the two genotypes (wild vs mutant group) in each SNP analysis. Resistin levels only changed after surgery in wild genotypes of both SNPs (rs1862513 and rs10401670). The improvement in insulin levels was lower in the mutant group of rs1862513 (_3.4 +/_ 0.4 UI/dl vs _2.3 +/_ 0.2 UI/dl; P < 0.05) and rs1040167 (_3.3 +/_ 0.2 UI/dl vs _1.9 +/_ 0.3 UI/dl; P < 0.05). The decrease of HOMA_IR was lower in mutant group of rs1862513 (_1.4 +/_ 0.1 units vs _0.9 +/_ 0.3 units; P < 0.05) and rs10401670 (_1.2 +/_ 0.2 units vs _0.9 +/_ 0.3 units; P < 0.05). Conclusions The main result of this study was that the mutant genotype of two SNPs of the RETN gene (rs1862513 and rs10401670) was associated with a lack of change in resistin secondary to biliopancreatic diversion.

C. M. Apovian	The clinical and economic consequences of obesity	2013			"Obesity and its many serious comorbidities exert a heavy toll in both human and economic terms. More than one-third of adults in the United States are obese and, therefore, subject to elevated rates of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. The negative effect on the quality of life (QoL) of these individuals is enormous. Among the severely obese, QoL scores are comparable to QoL scores associated with diabetes and laryngeal cancer. The medical costs of obesity-related illnesses in the United States have been estimated at $209.7 billion annually (in 2008 dollars). For example, with regard to impact on pharmaceutical costs, obesity is associated with a more than 13-fold increase in the cost of antidiabetic medications. The cost of absenteeism to employers has been estimated to exceed $4.3 billion annually. Successful and cost-effective short-term treatments for obesity are available, and have been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk factors. Intensive lifestyle intervention with the goal of losing 7% of baseline body weight, for example, resulted in a 58% reduction in the risk of diabetes in patients with prediabetes. In clinical trials, improvements in other cardiovascular risk factors, such as elevated triglycerides and high blood pressure, have also been seen with a modest weight loss of 5% to 10% of baseline body weight. As obesity becomes an ever greater public health problem, additional interventions with long-term efficacy are needed to reduce body weight and maintain weight loss."

Adding access blood flow surveillance reduces thrombosis and improves arteriovenous fistula patency: a randomized controlled trial	2017	10.5301/jva.5000700	CN-01393716	"PURPOSE: Stenosis is the main cause of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) failure. It is still unclear whether surveillance based on vascular access blood flow (QA) enhances AVF function and longevity. METHODS: We conducted a three_year follow_up randomized, controlled, multicenter, open_label trial to compare QA_based surveillance and pre_emptive repair of subclinical stenosis with standard monitoring/surveillance techniques in prevalent mature AVFs. AVFs were randomized to either the control group (surveillance based on classic alarm criteria; n = 104) or to the QA group (QA measured quarterly using Doppler ultrasound [M_Turbo¨] and ultrasound dilution [Transonic¨] added to classic surveillance; n = 103).The criteria for intervention in the QA group were: 25% reduction in QA, QA<500 mL/min or significant stenosis with hemodynamic repercussion (peak systolic velocity [PSV] more than 400 cm/sc or PSV pre_stenosis/stenosis higher than 3). RESULTS: At the end of follow_up we observed a significant reduction in the thrombosis rate in the QA group (0.025 thrombosis/patient/year in the QA group vs. 0.086 thrombosis/patient/year in the control group [p = 0.007]). There was a significant improvement in the thrombosis_free patency rate (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.11_0.82; p = 0.011) and in the secondary patency rate in the QA group (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.26_0.93; p = 0.030), with no differences in the primary patency rate between the groups (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.57_1.61; p = 0.935).There was greater need for a central venous catheter and more hospitalizations associated with vascular access in the control group (p = 0.034/p = 0.029).Total vascular access_related costs were higher in the control group (Û227.194 vs. Û133.807; p = 0.029).

Bariatric surgery (BS) improves metabolism and inflammation in severe obesity and is associated with gut microbiota modifications. Here, we characterised severe obesity-associated dysbiosis (ie, MGR, microbiota composition and functional characteristics) and assessed whether BS would rescue these changes., DESIGN: Sixty-one severely obese subjects, candidates for adjustable gastric banding (AGB, n=20) or Roux-en-Y-gastric bypass (RYGB, n=41), were enrolled. Twenty-four subjects were followed at 1, 3 and 12 months post-BS. Gut microbiota and serum metabolome were analysed using shotgun metagenomics and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Confirmation groups were included., RESULTS: Low gene richness (LGC) was present in 75% of patients and correlated with increased trunk-fat mass and comorbidities (type 2 diabetes, hypertension and severity). Seventy-eight metagenomic species were altered with LGC, among which 50% were associated with adverse body composition and metabolic phenotypes. Nine serum metabolites (including glutarate, 3-methoxyphenylacetic acid and L-histidine) and functional modules containing protein families involved in their metabolism were strongly associated with low MGR. BS increased MGR 1 year postsurgery, but most RYGB patients remained with low MGR 1 year post-BS, despite greater metabolic improvement than AGB patients., CONCLUSIONS: We identified major gut microbiota alterations in severe obesity, which include decreased MGR and related functional pathways linked with metabolic deteriorations. The lack of full rescue post-BS calls for additional strategies to improve the gut microbiota ecosystem and microbiome-host interactions in severe obesity., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01454232.

"D. E. Arterburn, D. A. Telem, R. F. Kushner and A. P. Courcoulas"	Benefits and Risks of Bariatric Surgery in Adults: A Review	2020	https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.12567		"Importance: Severe obesity and its related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and sleep apnea, are very common in the United States, but currently very few patients with these conditions choose to undergo bariatric surgery. Summaries of the expanding evidence for both the benefits and risks of bariatric surgery are needed to better guide shared decision-making conversations. Observations: There are approximately 252000 bariatric procedures (per 2018 numbers) performed each year in the US, of which an estimated 15% are revisions. The 1991 National Institutes of Health guidelines recommended consideration of bariatric surgery in patients with a body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 40 or higher or 35 or higher with serious obesity-related comorbidities. These guidelines are still widely used; however, there is increasing evidence that bariatric procedures should also be considered for patients with type 2 diabetes and a body mass index of 30 to 35 if hyperglycemia is inadequately controlled despite optimal medical treatment for type 2 diabetes. Substantial evidence indicates that surgery results in greater improvements in weight loss and type 2 diabetes outcomes, compared with nonsurgical interventions, regardless of the type of procedures used. The 2 most common procedures used currently, the sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass, have similar effects on weight loss and diabetes outcomes and similar safety through at least 5-year follow-up. However, emerging evidence suggests that the sleeve procedure is associated with fewer reoperations, and the bypass procedure may lead to more durable weight loss and glycemic control. Although safety is a concern, current data indicate that the perioperative mortality rates range from 0.03% to 0.2%, which has substantially improved since early 2000s. More long-term randomized studies are needed to assess the effect of bariatric procedures on cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other health outcomes and to evaluate emerging newer procedures. Conclusions and Relevance: Modern bariatric procedures have strong evidence of efficacy and safety. All patients with severe obesity-and especially those with type 2 diabetes-should be engaged in a shared decision-making conversation about the risks and benefits of surgery compared with continuing usual medical and lifestyle treatment, and the decision about surgery should be driven primarily by informed patient preferences."

Method(s): Fifty-six patients aged >= 60 years who underwent bariatric surgery, as either sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass, were matched for sex, baseline body mass index (BMI) and surgery type, with 112 younger controls, aged 18-60 years. We compared complications, weight loss, resolution of co-morbidities, and changes in body composition status (fat mass [FM], fat-free mass [FFM], lean mass [LM] and percentage of fat mass [FM%]) 12 months postoperatively between the groups. Result(s): Complications were similar in the two groups. Diabetes mellitus (DM) and dyslipidemia showed similar remission and improvement rates postoperatively in the two groups. Remission from hypertension (HTN) was higher in the control group, but improvement rates were similar. Changes from baseline to 12 months postoperatively in weight, BMI, excess weight loss (EWL%), total weight loss (TWL%), FFM, and LM were greater in the control group than in the older-age group. Changes in FM and FM% were similar in the two groups. Conclusion(s): Bariatric surgery is a safe intervention for the management of obesity and obesity-related co-morbidities in older adults, with similar surgery-risk and complication rates to those of younger adults. Reduction in FM and FM% was equal in two groups and the concern about greater LM loss in older adults seems unfounded.Copyright © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

Asaad	Different ventilation techniques and hemodynamic optimization to maintain regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) during laparoscopic bariatric surgery: a prospective randomized interventional study	2018	https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00540-018-2493-9		"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the changes in regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) in response to different ventilation strategies: inspired oxygen concentration (FiO2), end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2), and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) in addition to optimizing mean arterial pressure (MAP) in obese patients subjected to laparoscopic bariatric surgery in the reverse trendelenburg position., METHODS: 50 obese patients were randomly assigned into one of two groups. Each group is 25 patients. Control patients subjected to a ventilation strategy aimed to maintain FiO2 0.4 and EtCO2 30 mmHg without PEEP. Study patients were assigned to specific protocol; T0, baseline rScO2; T1, 5 min following induction; T2, PP/RTP (10 min after pneumoperitoneum and reverse trendelenburg position); T3, PEEP 10 cmH2O; T4, FiO2 1.0; T5, EtCO2 40 mmHg and T6, MAP/BL; MAP back to baseline in both groups., MAIN RESULTS: 10 min after PP/RTP, there was a significant decrease in rScO2 in both groups. At T4, with FiO2 1.0, there was significant improvement in rScO2 when compared to T2. At T5, with EtCO2 40 mmHg, rScO2 significantly enhanced when compared to EtCO2 30 mmHg. At T4 and T5, we observed highly significance difference between both groups. At the end of the procedure and when MAP increased back to baseline (T6) in both groups, rScO2 statistically increased in both groups when compared to T2., CONCLUSION: In obese patients, subjected to laparoscopic bariatric surgery in reverse trendelenburg position, adjustment of ventilation strategies and hemodynamic optimization succeeded to improve rScO2."
"M. Asgari, A. Sanaee and F. Pazyar"	Comparison of roux-en-y gastric bypass techniques with and without distal gastric plication in patients with morbid obesity	2022			"Background: The vertical gastric plication technique leads to poor long-term outcomes and is associated with intolerable reflux, dysphagia, or weight gain in a high percentage of patients. Therefore, in this study, the therapeutic results of two methods with and without plication of the distal part of the stomach in gastric bypass surgery in patients with morbid obesity were compared. Method(s): In this clinical trial randomized single-blind study, 40 patients with morbid obesity who were referred to one of the hospitals affiliated with Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences in Ahvaz during March 2020-February 2021, were randomly divided into two groups: with plication of the distal part of the stomach (n=20) and without plication of the distal part of the stomach (n=20) in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. Weight loss rate, complications related to surgery, outcomes and satisfaction of patient were noted and followed up for one year. Result(s): The mean percentage of weight loss at different times did not show a significant difference between the two groups (p>0.05). The length of hospitalization after surgery was significantly less in the distal gastric plication group (p=0.0001). During one year of follow-up, hypertension, diabetes, HLP, and reflux were well in the distal plication method but showed no significant difference (p>0.05). Satisfaction of the patients was more in the distal plication method and showed no significant difference (p>0.05). One year after the operation, the change of diet showed no significant difference in the two groups (p>0.05). Conclusion(s): It looks that using the laparoscopic distal gastric plication method is an effective and safe method and is associated with early ideal weight loss, reduction of complications, and increase in satisfaction of patients with BMI>=35 kg/m2. No need to use a foreign body, stapler or bandage and the possibility of re-operation are the advantages of this technique.Copyright © 2022 Asgari et al."

Weight loss may reduce this. Reviews have considered the long-term effects of weight loss but are related mainly to more obese participants often on obesity medication and/or undergoing obesity surgery. This systematic review, based on lifestyle interventions for adults (18 to 65 years) with mean baseline BMI of <35 kg/m(2), links weight change to blood pressure difference. A systematic review of studies reporting weight differences and blood pressure outcomes, published between 1990 and 2008 with follow-up of > or =2 years identified 8 clinical trials or controlled before and after studies (represented by 9 articles) and 8 cohort studies. Differences ranged from -11 to +4kg for weight, -7 to +2.2 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure and -13 to +6.1 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure. For this population group, no quantifiable relationship between weight and diastolic blood pressure difference was found, possibly because of small weight losses, differing weight status responses, or because pharmacologically controlled hypertension masked weight loss influences. Systolic differences were in line with previous reviews of 1 kg:1 mm Hg relationship, but only for follow-up periods of 2 to 3 years, possibly reflecting the fact that regardless of maintained weight loss, blood pressure often reverts back to higher levels. Lifestyle interventions for weight and blood pressure are limited in this target group, and there has been no exploration of successful intervention components. An individual patient data analysis may uncover baseline and medication effects, explore differences between weight groups, and may identify successful components. Such an analysis would enable effective development of preventative interventions for both hypertension and obesity."

Grant"	Systematic review of the long-term effects and economic consequences of treatments for obesity and implications for health improvement	2004			"OBJECTIVES: To undertake a systematic review of the long-term effects of obesity treatments on body weight, risk factors for disease, and disease., METHODS: The study encompassed three systematic reviews that examined different aspects of obesity treatments. (1) A systematic review of obesity treatments in adults where the methods of the Cochrane Collaboration were applied and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow-up of at least 1 year were evaluated. (2) A systematic epidemiological review, where studies were sought on long-term effects of weight loss on morbidity and/or mortality, and examined through epidemiological modelling. (3) A systematic economic review that sought reports with both costs and outcomes of treatment, including recent reports that assessed the cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical and surgical interventions. A Markov model was also adopted to examine the cost-effectiveness of a low-fat diet and exercise intervention in adults with obesity and impaired glucose tolerance., RESULTS: The addition of the drugs orlistat or sibutramine was associated with weight loss and generally improved risk factors, apart from diastolic blood pressure for sibutramine. Metformin was associated with decreased mortality after 10 years in obese people with type 2 diabetes. Low-fat diets were associated with continuing weight loss for 3 years and improvements in risk factors, as well as prevention of type 2 diabetes and improved control of hypertension. Insufficient evidence was available to demonstrate the benefits of low calorie or very low calorie diets. The addition of an exercise or behaviour programme to diet was associated with improved weight loss and risk factors for at least 1 year. Studies combining low-fat diets, exercise and behaviour therapy suggested improved hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Family therapy was associated with improved weight loss for 2 years compared to individual therapy. There was insufficient evidence to conclude that individual therapy was more beneficial than group therapy. Weight lost more quickly (within 1 year), from the epidemiology review, may be more beneficial with respect to the risk of mortality. The effects of intentional weight loss need further investigation. Weight loss from surgical and non-surgical interventions for people suffering from obesity was associated with decreased risk of development of diabetes, and a reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol and blood pressure, in the long term. Targeting high-risk individuals with drugs or surgery was likely to result in a cost per additional life-year or quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of no more than 13,000 British pounds. There was also suggestive evidence of cost saving from treatment of people with type 2 diabetes with metformin. Targeting surgery on people with severe obesity and impaired glucose tolerance was likely to be more cost-effective at 2329 British pounds per additional life-year. Economic modelling over 6 years for diet and exercise for people with impaired glucose tolerance was associated with a high initial cost per additional QALY, but by the sixth year the cost per QALY was 13,389 British pounds. Results did not include cost savings from diseases other than diabetes, and therefore may be conservative., CONCLUSIONS: The drugs orlistat and sibutramine appear beneficial for the treatment of adults with obesity, and metformin for obese patients with type 2 diabetes. Exercise and/or behaviour therapy appear to improve weight loss when added to diet. Low-fat diets with exercise, or with exercise and behaviour therapy are associated with the prevention of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Long-term weight loss in epidemiological studies was associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, and may be beneficial for cardiovascular disease. Low-fat diets and exercise interventions in individuals at risk of obesity-related illness are of comparable cost to drug treatments. Long-term pragmatic RCTs of obesity treatments in populations with obesity-related illness r at high risk of developing such illness are needed (to include an evaluation of risk factors, morbidity, quality of life and economic evaluations). Drug trials that include dietary advice, plus exercise and/or behaviour therapy are also needed. Research exploring effective types of exercise, diet or behaviour and also interventions to prevent obesity in adults is required."

We present a case study of such a patient and review of the literature. Materials and Methods A 60_year old female haemodialysis_dependent patient had a previous history of adult polycystic kidney disease, renal transplant (Nov 1990_Sept 2004), atrial fibrillation, Hodgkins lymphoma, hypothyroidism, hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and sleep apnoea. Previous attempts at weight reduction (including bimonthly dietetic consultations and medication) had failed and her weight at consultation with the bariatric service was 104 kg (BMI 39 kg/m2). LSG was performed using multiple firings of a linear stapler (EndoGIA, Covidien) sizing the pouch using a 34 F bougie. The patient made an uneventful postoperative recovery and was discharged 3_days postoperatively. At follow_up weight, pre_dialysis urea, phosphate, blood pressure (BP) and glucose control were noted. Searches were made of the electronicOvid,Medline and Pubmed databases using the search terms sleeve gastrectomy, chronic renal failure and kidney disease. Results During the year preceding LSG, the patient's average pre_dialysis urea was 22.8 mmol/l, phosphate was 2.16 mmol/l (with phosphate binders), BP was 145/79 mmHg (with Bisoprolol 2.5 mg daily). Ten months following her LSG her weight dropped to 78.6 kg (BMI 29.6 kg/m2, excess weight loss 63 %), average pre_dialysis urea was 11.2 mmol/l, phosphate was 1.5 mmol/l (without phosphate binders), BP was 144/79mmHg (with Bisoprolol reduced to 1.25mg daily). Finally, her IGT resolved and gliclazide was stopped postoperatively. Review of the literature identified only one published case series (1) of five patients with CKD who underwent LSG. In keeping with the present case study, the latter series1 demonstrated LSG an effective treatment for obesity in patients with CKD; aiding control of co_morbidities and permitting access to transplantation lists. Discussion LSG was effective in reducing BMI in an obese haemodialysisdependent patient who failed previous weight_loss measures. LSG was also associated with resolution of IGT, sleep apnoea and improvement in predialysis urea and hyperphosphataemia. Whilst there presently exists little data on the efficacy of LSG in patients with CKD, an ongoing randomised controlled trial (NCT01053130) is addressing this. Pending data fromthe latter, LSGmay be considered a modality to reduce weight, improve co_morbidities and permit access to transplantation in haemodialysis_dependent patients with a BMI 35 kg/m2 who fail other weight_loss measures."

Twenty male adults, <= 65 years old, with T2D, body mass index (BMI) > 28 kg/m2 and < 35 kg/m2, and HbA1c level > 8% were randomized to SG + TB or to SMT. Outcomes were the remission in the metabolic and cardiovascular risk variables up to 24 months., RESULTS: At 24 months, SG + TB group showed a significant decrease in HbaA1c values (9.3 +/- 2.1 versus 5.5 +/- 1.1%, P = < 0.05) whereas SMT group maintained similar levels from baseline (8.0 +/- 1.5 versus 8.3 +/- 1.1%, P = NS). BMI values were lower in the SG + TB group (25.3 +/- 2.8 kg/m2 versus 30.9 +/- 2.5 kg/m2; P = < 0.001). At 24 months, none patient in SG + TB group needed medications for hyperlipidemia/hypertension. HDL-cholesterol levels increased in the SG + TB group (33 +/- 8 to 45 +/- 15 mg/dL, P < 0.001). After 24 months, the area under the curve (AUC) of GLP1 increased and in the SG + TB group and the AUC of the GIP concentrations was lower in the SG + TB group than in the SMT. At 3 months, SG + TB group showed a marked increase in FGF19 levels (74.1 +/- 45.8 to 237.3 +/- 234 pg/mL; P = 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: SG + TB is superior to SMT and was associated with a better metabolic and cardiovascular profile."

Maternal obesity is associated with increased maternal and fetal risks during pregnancy. Bariatric surgery has emerged as one of the most sustainable treatments for severe obesity and its comorbidities. Patients who have undergone bariatric surgery often experience drastic improvements in hypertension and diabetes. It is not surprising, therefore, that the incidence of bariatric surgery is increasing, particularly in women of childbearing age. In fact, many women undergoing bariatric surgery plan to become pregnant in the future. Bariatric surgery may have a beneficial effect on rates of fetal macrosomia, gestational diabetes, hypertension, and preeclampsia. Conversely, studies have showed that bariatric surgery may increase the risk of small for gestational age infants and preterm birth. Given its rising incidence, it is important that physicians be able to thoroughly and accurately counsel and treat patients who plan to, or do, become pregnant after bariatric surgery.Copyright © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

A systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression were performed to assess the impact of lifestyle interventions incorporating a physical activity (PA) component on health outcomes of class II and III obese individuals., METHODS: An electronic search was conducted in 4 databases (Medline, Scopus, CINAHL and Sportdiscus). Two independent investigators selected original studies assessing the impact of lifestyle interventions with PA components on anthropometric parameters, cardiometabolic risk factors (fat mass, blood pressure, lipid and glucose metabolism), behaviour modification (PA and nutritional changes), and quality of life in adults with body mass index (BMI) >= 35 kg/m2. Estimates were pooled using a random-effect model (DerSimonian and Laird method). Heterogeneity between studies was assessed by the Cochran's chi-square test and quantified through an estimation of the I2., RESULTS: Of the 3,170 identified articles, 56 met our eligibility criteria, with a large majority of uncontrolled studies (80%). The meta-analysis based on uncontrolled studies showed significant heterogeneity among all included studies. The pooled mean difference in weight loss was 8.9 kg (95% CI, 10.2-7.7; p < 0.01) and 2.8 kg/m2 in BMI loss (95% CI, 3.4-2.2; p < 0.01). Long-term interventions produced superior weight loss (11.3 kg) compared to short-term (7.2 kg) and intermediate-term (8.0 kg) interventions. A significant global effect of lifestyle intervention on fat mass, waist circumference, blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL-C, triglycerides and fasting insulin was found (p<0.01), without significant effect on HDL-C and fasting blood glucose., CONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle interventions incorporating a PA component can improve weight and various cardiometabolic risk factors in class II and III obese individuals. However, further high quality trials are needed to confirm this evidence, especially beyond weight loss."

Alternative methods for analgesia may be beneficial for management of bariatric surgery. We evaluated the effect of dexmedetomidine on anesthetic requirements during surgery, hemodynamic, recovery profile and morphine use in the postoperative period., METHODS: Eighty adult patients scheduled for elective laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery were randomly assigned to one of two study groups; Group D (40 patients) received dexmedetomidine (0.8-microg/kg bolus, 0,4 microg kg(-1) h) and Group P (40 patients) received normal saline (placebo) in the same volume and rate. Intraoperative and postoperative mean blood pressure and heart rate were recorded. The total amount of intraoperative fentanyl and propofol required to maintain anesthesia were measured. Recovery profile, pain score and total amount of morphine used via patient controlled analgesia (PCA) were assessed., RESULTS: During surgery, dexmedetomidine decreased the total amount of intraoperative fentanyl and propofol required for maintenance of anesthesia compared to placebo. Patients who received dexmedetomidine showed significant decrease of intraoperative and postoperative mean blood pressure, heart rate. In the postoperative period, dexmedetomidine decreased pain scores and PCA morphine use significantly and showed better recovery profile as compared to the placebo Group. There was no difference in the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) between both groups., CONCLUSION: The intraoperative infusion of dexmedetomidine decreased the total amount of propofol and fentanyl required to maintain anesthesia, offered better control of intraoperative and postoperative hemodynamics, decreased postoperative pain level, decreased the total amount of morphine used and showed better recovery profile compared with placebo."

Pylorus-preserving single-anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy (SADI-SG) is a modified duodenal switch technique. Gastric plication (GP) is an alternate to SG. Method(s): Morbidly obese (BMI of > 40, or > 35 in the presence of diabetes or prediabetes) patients were recruited and operated on to perform SADI with GP. Complications related to surgery were recorded to assess the feasibility of the procedure. Weight-loss outcomes were analysed to determine efficacy. Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory 2 (MMPI-2) was recorded after 1 year of follow-up, and test scales were used to describe physiological phenomena. Result(s): Seventeen middle-aged (mean: 40 years) patients were involved in our study; 15 of them were females. The mean duration of surgery was 205 min. There were no complications of conversion, death, bleeding, VTE or 30-day readmission to hospital. We did experience CD4a (pulmonary insufficiency due to chronic lung disease) and a CD3b (anastomosis leakage treated laparoscopically) complications. Vomiting occurred in three cases (CD1). Obesity-related comorbidities showed favourable resolution rates (77.8% for hypertension, 81.2% for dyslipidaemia, 100% for diabetes at the 1-year follow-up). Weight-loss outcomes were favourable (53.20 EWL%, and 35.58 TWL% at 1-year follow-up). Greater weight loss caused significantly higher levels of Depression (t(13.958) = - 2.373; p = 0.00; p < 0.05) and Low Positive Emotions (t(13.301) = - 2.954; p = 0.00; p < 0.05) and Introversion/Low Positive Emotionality (t(13.408) = - 1.914; p = 0.02; p < 0.05) in MMPI-2 data. Conclusion(s): According to our safety study, SADI-GP is a promising malabsorptive procedure, but a long-term high-volume case series or a randomised controlled trial is necessary to evaluate complication rates and weight-loss outcomes. Emotional dysregulation is common among bariatric surgery patients according to personality inventory data; therefore, psychological follow-up and psychotherapeutic support are necessary for weight-loss maintenance.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s)."

George"	Management of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes associated with hepatitis C virus infection	2011			"Insulin resistance (IR) is present in approximately 50% of patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Beyond the well-described risk of developing diabetes, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, and cardiovascular disease, IR in hepatitis C is associated with hepatic inflammation, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular cancer. Moreover, IR is associated with a twofold to fourfold reduction in the effectiveness of viral eradication using regimens based on pegylated interferon and ribavirin. In the last decade, a direct pathogenic role for hepatitis C virus infection in IR has been discerned. Targeting IR in CHC, therefore, has the potential to reduce liver disease progression and to improve response rates to antiviral therapy. Several therapeutic interventions for the management of IR in patients with CHC have been reported, some with promising results. Although lifestyle intervention should be recommended for all patients with CHC, whether greater insulin sensitivity results in improved sustained virologic response rates to antiviral therapy is unclear. Despite encouraging data, the overall efficacy of pharmacologic approaches targeting IR to improve sustained virologic response is also not well established. This review summarizes current knowledge on the pathophysiology and management of IR and type 2 diabetes associated with hepatitis C infection. © 2012 FBCommunication s.r.l. a socio unico."

This review will focus on three novel therapies that have been identified for potential treatment of obesity and its associated CVD risk factors., RECENT FINDINGS: Intermittent fasting (IF) studies in animal models have shown improvements in cardiometabolic factors, including improved glucose metabolism, reduced inflammation, and reduced blood pressure. However, there is still a lack of prospective human trials to support results from animal-based studies and observational data. Studies of ketogenic diets in humans have produced mixed effects in CVD risk factors. It has been shown that the ketogenic diet (KD) increases low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) but decreases triglycerides. Additionally, implementation of KD in rodent studies have demonstrated increased insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Bariatric surgery is a useful tool to help patients with obesity lose significant amounts of weight while alleviating CVD risk factors such as hypertension, LDL-C levels, triglyceride levels, and diabetes. The type of procedure influences degree of improvement in weight and CVD risk factors, yet complications remain possible. IF and bariatric surgery offer potential for weight loss and treatment of CVD risk factors. Negative cardiovascular effects of KD have been noted and should be considered before recommending this diet to patients, particularly those with established cardiovascular disease."

Bedi	LSG vs OAGB-1 year follow-up data-a randomized control trial gastric bypass procedures including Roux-en-y gastric bypass (RYGB) and one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB)/MGB	2017	https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11695-017-2774-7		"Background: Severe Obesity is one of the major health problem of the world and is associated with several diseases and comorbidities like T2DM and Hypertension. Introduction: Bariatric surgery is performed more and more frequently as the treatment of choice for weight loss and correction of severe comorbidities. Objective(s): Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy(LSG) has become one of the most popular bariatric procedure. One anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) is rapidly emerging as a safe and effective bariatric and metabolic procedure. The aim of this study is to compare the 1 year follow-up results of LSG and OAGB in terms of excess weight loss, resolution of comorbidities and complications. Method(s): A prospective randomized study of results between 100 LSG and 90 OAGB patients was done from 2012 to 2015. The results were compared regarding percentage of excess weight loss, resolution of major comorbidities and complications. Result(s): The mean BMI for the LSG group and the OAGB was 44.9 and 45.1 KG/M2, respectively. Percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) for LSG was 60.2% and that of OAGB was 64.3% at 1 year. Diabetes remission was 72% in LSG patients and 82.3% in OAGB patients. Remission of hypertension was 65.13% in LSG patients and 66.12% in OAGB patients. Conclusion(s): In our study, there was no significant difference between LSG and OAGB in outcome at 1 year follow-up in remission of hypertension. OAGB had slightly better outcome in % of excess weight loss and T2 DM remission. Further long term follow-up is needed to compare the results of both the procedures."

METHOD(S): Fifty-nine patients who underwent bariatric surgery were randomized in the post-operative period to a 12-week supervised exercise training program (moderate intensity combination aerobic/resistance exercise training program) or a control group. Indices of HRV including time-domain, spectral-domain, and nonlinear parameters were measured preoperatively, and at 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULT(S): After the surgical procedure, both groups improved anthropometric parameters. Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia resolutions were similar between groups. Total body weight loss at 6 and 12 months were also comparable between groups (6 months: 28+/-6 vs. 30+/-6%; 12 months: 38+/-9 vs. 38+/-10%; control vs. intervention group respectively). Bariatric surgery improved HRV parameters at 12 months compared to the pre-operative values in the intervention group: standard deviation of R-R interval (SDNN) (122.6+/-33.1 to 156.0+/-46.4 ms), low frequency (LF) (5.8+/-0.7 to 6.3+/-0.8 ms2), and high frequency (HF) (4.7+/-0.9 to 5.1+/-0.8 ms2) (all p<0.001). For the control patients, similar improvements in SDNN (118.8+/-20.1 to 150.0+/-39.4 ms), LF (5.7+/-0.8 to 6.1+/-0.9 ms2), and HF (4.7+/-0.9 to 5.0+/-0.9 ms2) were obtained (all p<0.001). However, there was no add-on impact of the supervised exercise training program on HRV after 12 months (p>0.05 for all HRV parameters). CONCLUSION(S): Bariatric surgery is associated with an improvement in HRV. A supervised exercise training program in the post-operative period did not modulate further the benefits of bariatric surgery regarding HRV parameters."

The objective of this study was to compare the effect of weight loss after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on BP, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), and urinary electrolytes excretion to those of dietary advice., Methods: This was a case-control prospective study including obese patients referred for RYGB (cases) and obese receiving diet advice only (controls). Ambulatory BP, plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), and urinary electrolytes were measured before (M0) and after intervention (M3: 3 months and M12: 12 months)., Results: Twenty-five patients were included in the RYGB group and twelve patients in the control group. After 12 months, weight loss (-42 +/- 11.5 vs -12.3 +/- 6.3 kg in the control group, p=0.001) and decrease in PAC were more pronounced in the RYGB group (-34 +/- 76 vs +14 +/- 45 pg/ml in the control group, p=0.002). There was no difference in PRA between both groups (-0.08 +/- 1.68 vs 0.01 +/- 0.37 ng/ml/h, p=0.31). Sodium excretion was more marked in the RYGB group after 3 months only (-89 +/- 14.9 vs -9.9 +/- 27.9 mmol/day, p=0.009). The decrease in SBP was similar between both groups (-6.9 +/- 9.9 vs -7.1 +/- 11.9 mmHg in the control group, p=0.96)., Conclusions: Bariatric-induced weight loss induces a progressive decrease in PAC independently of PRA and sodium excretion.

The aim of the current study was to assess the effects of DJBL explantation on glycemic control and body weight., METHODS: This prospective, observational study included only patients with T2DM who had the DJBL implanted for at least 6 months and had a follow-up of at least 12 months after explantation. The primary endpoints were changes in glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and body weight during the 12 months after explantation. Secondary endpoints were changes in fasting plasma glucose, blood pressure, and plasma lipid levels., RESULTS: In total, 59 patients completed the 12-month follow-up after explantation. During this period body weight increased by 5.6 (standard deviation, 6.4) kg (P < .001) and HbA1c rose from 65 (SD 17) to 70 (SD 20) mmol/mol (P < .001). However, body weight remained 8.0 (SD 8.6) kg (P < .001) lower than before implantation, that is, corresponding to a net total body weight loss of 7.4% (SD 7.6) (P < .001). Although HbA1c was significantly higher 12 months after explantation compared with baseline and the mean daily dose of insulin used was comparable, the number of patients on insulin remained significantly lower than before implantation., CONCLUSIONS: Explantation of the DJBL is associated with weight gain and worsening of glycemic control, although some beneficial effects remained detectable 12 months after explantation. A change in strategy is needed to preserve the beneficial effects of DJBL treatment. (Clinical trial registration number: 746\100111.).

Procedures for obesity surgery lead to remission of metabolic diseases to a good extent. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Laparoscopic single anastomosis mini-gastric bypass (MGB) are 2 commonly used procedures. Despite many thousands of published cases, MGB continues to be controversial and many national societies do not regard it as a mainstream bariatric procedure.nOur study aims to prove the efficacy of Laparoscopic MGB by comparing with LSG (a procedure well accepted by international society) in terms of weight loss and remission of diabetes mellitus and other co morbidities specifically in Asian population. Material(s) and Method(s): 85 matched patients out of 120 were selected with morbid obesity randomized into groups.(n=43) underwent MGD and (n=42) underwent LSG. Patients were followed up post op at 6,12 and 24 months in both the groups. Both groups were compared statistically in terms of loss of weight,remission of diabetes,hypertension and obstructive sleep apnoea and dyslipidimia.3 patients were lost to follow up, 1 in LSG group and 2 in MGB group.1 patient in LSG group had marginal ulcers and underwent revision rou-en y gastrectomy.These were excluded from the analysis. Conclusion(s): Thousands of cases of Laparoscopic mini-gastric bypass have been reported in literature with proven results though it is not widely worldwide. In our study it proved to result in more effective weight loss and co morbidity reduction compared to sleeve gastrectomy. Duodenal exclusion in mini-gastric bypass may have led to the incretin effect. Further studies with long term follow up are required to substantiate the effectiveness and long term outcome of procedure for better international acceptance. [TABLE PRESENTED]."

This has been attributed to genetic factors. Laparoscopic minigastric bypass is a single anastomosis procedure with a shorter learning curve.We present a comparative study between LMGB vs conventional Rou-en-y Gastric bypass(RYGB) in terms of weight loss and co morbidity improvement in an asian population. Minigastric bypass depite its proven efficacy in asian populations in terms of weight loss is considered inferior to rou-en y gastric bypass in the west.Aim of our study is to compare the two in terms of weight loss and co morbidity reduction and rate of complications. Material(s) and Method(s): 102 patients matched in terms of Age,sex, BMI and co morbidities were randomized into 2 groups and 51 patients each underwent MGB and RYGB. Patients were followed up for a period of 2 yrs and the 2 groups were compared in terms of operative time, complications, reoperation rate, weight loss, BMI reduction, glycosylated hemoglobin(diabetes control) and dyslipidemia. Out of the 51 patients in the MGB group 2 patients had early post operative obstruction and required re operation. 1 patient from this group was lost to follow up.4 patients from the RYGB group had early post operative obstruction and required reoperation.1 patient was lost to follow up Results: Post operatively a minor complication rate of 5% was noted with the minigastric bypass group compared to 4.7% with rou en y group.Rate of major complications including anastomotic leak was found to be equivalent in both the groups.*Conclusion: No significant difference was found between the mini-gastric bypass and roux en y gastric bypass groups in terms of BMI, diabetes control, dyslipidemia. There was no significant difference in the anastomotic leak rate. Therefore, Mini-gastric bypass seems to be equally efficacious to roux en y gastric bypass in terms of outcomes and complication rate and warrants worldwide acceptance. [TABLE PRESENTED]."

However, the surgical management in case of failure is still debated., OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the risks and benefits of converting SG to biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS) for suboptimal outcome after SG., SETTING: University-affiliated tertiary care center., METHODS: We included all patients who underwent a laparoscopic second-stage duodenal switch (DS) for weight loss failure after SG and had a minimal follow-up of 2 years. Patients were matched 1:1 for age, sex, body mass index, and year of surgery with a group of patients who underwent a single-stage laparoscopic BPD-DS. Data were obtained from our prospective electronic database and are reported as the mean +/- standard deviation, comparing 2- versus 1-stage BPD-DS., RESULTS: A total of 118 patients were included (59 in each group). There was no significant difference in initial body mass index (53.8 +/- 9.7 versus 52.7 +/- 7.8 kg/m2, P=.4), age (44.0 +/- 10.2 versus 43.4 +/- 9.6 yr, P=.5), and sex ratio (37 female/22 male, P > .9) between the 2 groups. Mean follow-up was 59.9 +/- 27 months, with an 85% (n=100) follow-up rate. Patients were converted to BPD-DS after a mean 24.4 +/- 10.2 months. There was no short- or long-term mortality. Major 90-days complications occurred in 2%, 5%, and 5% after SG, second-stage DS and single-stage BPD-DS, respectively (P > .05). At the time of conversion, the excess weight loss for SG was 39 +/- 17% and total weight loss was 20 +/- 9%. After DS or single-stage BPD-DS, the excess weight loss was 74.8 +/- 18% versus 87.9 +/- 18% at 1 year (n=107, P=.00021), 80.2 +/- 17% versus 92.3 +/- 14% at 2 years (n=100, P=.002), and 80.2 +/- 18% versus 87.2 +/- 16% at 3 years (n=70, P=.6). Total weight loss was 38.7 +/- 9% versus 44.5 +/- 8% at 1 year (P=.0004), 41.2 +/- 9% versus 46.8 +/- 7% at 2 years (P=.001), and 42.3 +/- 9% versus 45.1 +/- 9% at 3 years (P=.2). The incidence of type 2 diabetes and hypertension before surgery were 61% versus 54% and 58% versus 47%. Remission rate for type 2 diabetes increased from 59% to 94% after second-stage DS (P=.001), which is identical to first-stage BPD-DS (94%). Remission of hypertension increased from 42% to 77% after second-stage DS (P=.03) and was 71% after first-stage BPD-DS (P=.8)., CONCLUSION: Second-stage DS is an effective option for the management of suboptimal outcomes of SG, with an additional 41% excess weight loss and 35% remission rate for type 2 diabetes. At 3 years, the global outcomes of staged approach did not significantly differ from single-stage BPD-DS; however, longer-term outcomes are still needed.

Bariatric surgery is the only effective therapy to induce sufficient long-term weight loss for morbidly obese patients. Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (LRYGB) is the gold standard surgical technique. Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG) is a new promising bariatric procedure which has the advantage of maintaining an intact gastrointestinal tract. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of both techniques. Our hypothesis is that LSG has a similar percentage excess BMI loss (%EBMIL) after 5 years compared to LRYGB., METHODS/DESIGN: The Sleeve Bypass Trial is a randomized multicentre clinical trial: patients eligible for bariatric surgery are randomized to either LSG or LRYGB. Patients with a body mass index (BMI) >= 40 kg/m(2) or BMI 35 kg/m(2) with obesity related comorbidity (T2 DM, sleep apnoea, hypertension) are eligible for randomization. At randomization patients are stratified for centre, sex, T2 DM and BMI >= 50 kg/m(2). A total number of 620 patients will be enrolled and equally (1:1) randomized to both treatment arms. Only surgeons experienced in both operation techniques will participate in the Sleeve Bypass trial. The primary endpoint is the 5-year weight loss (%EBMIL) of LSG and LRYGB. Secondary endpoints are resolution of obesity related comorbidity, complications, revision bariatric surgery and quality of life (QOL) defined in various questionnaires., DISCUSSION: Long-term %EBMIL between the two treatment strategies used to be in favour of LRYGB, but more recent results throughout the world show similar %EBMIL in both techniques. If weight loss is comparable, obesity-related comorbidity and QOL after bariatric procedures should be taken into account when deciding on which surgical technique is to be preferred for certain subgroups in the future., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Dutch Trial Register: NTR 4741."

Measuring blood pressure (BP) accurately in obese patients is challenging and may require strategies that are less accurate, such as forearm cuffing or use of wrist cuffs. Pathophysiologic mechanisms of hypertension may differ between obese and non-obese individuals, which may result in differing effects of common BP-lowering medications. However, to date, there is insufficient trial data to recommend a different approach to medication selection based on body mass index. Additionally, the goal BP is generally not different between obese and non-obese patients. Weight loss should be emphasized for obese patients with hypertension, and interventions in addition to diet and exercise may include weight loss medications and bariatric surgery.

J. P. Block	Bariatric surgery leads to 3-year resolution of diabetes in 24% to 38% of patients	2014		CN-01036761	"Objective. To examine the 3_year efficacy of bariatric surgery on resolution of diabetes. Design. Randomized controlled trial. Setting and participants. Patients were participants in the STAMPEDE trial, a single_center study with enrollment from March 2007 to January 2011. 150 patients aged 20 to 60 years with a hemoglobin A1c of > 7% and a BMI of 27 to 43 kg/m2 were studied. Patients were excluded for a history of bariatric surgery or complex abdominal surgery and poorly controlled medical or psychiatric conditions [1]. Patients were randomized to intensive medical therapy, Roux_en_Y gastric bypass, or sleeve gastrectomy. All participants received intensive medical therapy, including lifestyle education, diabetes medical management, and cardiovascular risk reduction administered by a diabetes specialist every 3 months for 2 years and every 6 months thereafter. All surgeries were performed by a single surgeon, using equipment by Ethicon (a sponsor of the study, along with the National Institutes of Health, LifeScan, and the Cleveland Clinic). Main outcome measure. HbA1c of ² 6% at 3 years. Main results. At baseline, 68% were women and 74% were white. Participants had a mean age of 48 years (SD 8), mean A1c of 9.3% (1.5%), and mean BMI of 36 (3.5). 43% required insulin at baseline. Follow_up at 3 years was 91% (9 participants dropped out after enrollment, 4 lost to follow_up), and at this time, A1c levels were ² 6% for 5% of intensive medical therapy participants, 38% who had gastric bypass (P < 0.001 compared with medical therapy), and 24% who had sleeve gastrectomy (P = 0.01 compared with medical therapy); the difference between bypass and sleeve gastrectomy arms was not significant (P = 0.17). Nearly all of the participants reaching the primary outcome in the bariatric surgery arms achieved this goal A1c without using diabetic medications (35% and 20%). For the secondary outcome of A1c ² 7% without using diabetic medications, 0%, 58%, and 33% reached this endpoint in the medical therapy, bypass, and sleeve gastrectomy arms, respectively (P < 0.001 for both surgery arms compared to medical therapy; P = 0.01 comparing gastric bypass to sleeve gastrectomy). At 3 years, 2%, 69%, and 43% of participants were not taking any diabetic medications; 55% of medical therapy participants were taking insulin compared with 6% and 8% in the surgery arms. Weight loss was significantly greater in the gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy arms (24.5% and 21.1% of baseline body weight compared with the medical therapy arm with 4.2%). HDL cholesterol was higher and triglycerides were lower in both surgery arms, compared with medical therapy, but LDL cholesterol and blood pressure were not significantly different. Surgery participants also were taking fewer cardiovascular medications at 3 years. Quality of life was improved in 5 of 8 domains for the bypass arm compared with medical therapy and in 3 of 8 domains for the sleeve gastrectomy arm. Conclusion. Gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy surgery leads to substantial resolution of diabetes compared to medical therapy."

Medical treatment of type 2 diabetes with lifestyle and pharmacological interventions frequently fails to prevent the progress of the disease and the manifestation of diabetes complications. In recent years bariatric metabolic surgery has emerged as an effective treatment for patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Compared to medical treatment alone, metabolic surgery has been shown to be more effective in reducing mortality, improving hyperglycemia, hypertension and dyslipidemia in randomized clinical trials among patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, surgery also has the risk for acute perioperative complications, long-term micronutrient deficiencies and psychological problems. Weighing these risks against the benefits of significant weight loss and improved glycemic control, metabolic surgery seems to be a promising treatment option for obesity-associated type 2 diabetes. However, current guidelines and treatment algorithms for the treatment of type 2 diabetes either ignore or underestimate the potential of metabolic surgery. In my opinion, metabolic surgery should be considered earlier in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity and no longer be considered as the last therapeutic option for patients with obesity-associated type 2 diabetes."

In order to achieve more pronounced and sustainable results after RYGB, factors such as diameter of the gastroenterostomy, limb length, and pouch size are gripping points for improvement of design. Extending the pouch could improve results by altering food passage through the pouch. Objective(s): The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the effect of an extended pouch RYGB (EP-GB) and standard pouch RYGB (S-GB). Method(s): In total, 132 patients were randomized in two groups: 68 patients received an EP-GB (pouch length 10 cm) and 64 a S-GB (pouch length 5 cm). Subsequently, weight loss, remission of comorbidities, nutritional status, complications, quality of life, and GERD-symptoms were assessed during a follow-up of 3 years. Result(s): During the first 2 years of follow-up, no significant differences in terms of weight loss were observed. In the third year of follow-up, the S-GB group regained 3 kg, while in the EP-GB group no weight regain was observed. The mean TBWL after 36 months in the EP-GB group was 31% versus 27% in the S-GB group (p = 0.023). Additionally, besides a better remission rate of hypertension in the EP-GB group, no differences in complications, quality of life, and GERD-symptoms were found. Conclusion(s): Creation of an extended gastric pouch is a safe and effective modification in RYGB design. An EP-GB improves mid-term weight loss, potentially driven by a lower occurrence of weight regain.Copyright © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

Outcomes of the randomized controlled ELEGANCE REDO trial	2019	10.1016/j.soard.2018.10.010	CN-01666132	"Background: For a number of years the laparoscopic adjustable gastric band has been one of the leading bariatric procedures with good short_term outcomes. However, inadequate weight loss, weight regain, and other band_related complications in the long term led to an increase in revisional Roux_en_Y gastric bypass (RYGB) procedures. Lengthening the biliopancreatic limb, a relatively simple and safe adjustment of the standard technique, could improve the results of the revisional procedure. Objectives: The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the effect of a long biliopancreatic limb RYGB (LBP_GB) and standard RYGB (S_GB) as revisional procedure after laparoscopic adjustable gastric band. Setting: General hospital specialized in bariatric surgery Methods: One hundred forty_six patients were randomized in 2 groups; 73 patients underwent an S_GB (alimentary/biliopancreatic limb 150/75 cm), and 73 patients underwent LBP_GB (alimentary/biliopancreatic limb 75/150). Weight loss, remission of co_morbidities, quality of life, and complications were assessed during a period of 4 years. Results: Baseline characteristics between the groups were comparable. At 48 months the follow_up rate was 95%. Mean total weight loss after 24 months was 27% for LBP_GB versus 22% S_GB (P =.015); mean total weight loss after 48 months was 23% and 18%, respectively (P =.036). No significant differences in other parameters were found between the groups. Conclusions: A LBP_GB as revisional procedure after a failing laparoscopic adjustable gastric band improves short_ and long_term total weight loss compared with an S_GB. Together with future modifications this technically simple adjustment of the RYGB could significantly improve disappointing results after revisional surgery."

A NEW APPLICATION	2022	https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00464-022-09337-0		"Introduction: Obesity is considered the great pandemic of the twenty-first century, understood in the so-called metabolic syndrome in which four important factors converge: hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and dyslipidemia. It is an important social problem in which conservative measures have failed up to 10% with an increasing rise in associated comorbidities. Many publications have been developed about the role of surgery in the face of such conservative medical failure, leading to a resolution estimated in more than 80% of cases. Multiple techniques devised, although, after reaching the maximum exponent as the gold standard of the gastric bypass, due to important comorbidities and the irreversibility of the process, it is the vertical laparoscopic gastrectomy (gastric sleeve), which now determines its position. The two most widely performed techniques by the different groups of Bariatric Surgery worldwide are Gastric Bypass and Laparoscopic Vertical Gastrectomy (GVL). Both have proved to be effective in the treatment of obesity and its comorbidities. In the GVL, due to the technique in which the gastric structure is tubulized by a stapling line, the reinforcement of this line is recommended because it prevents bleeding and can reduce dehiscence, this being the central theme of our communication; said reinforcement can be performed by continuous monofilament suture, epiploplasty, biological or synthetic protectors of the staple line or biological adhesives n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate, an adhesive widely used in hernia repair once the prosthetic material (mesh) is implanted, thus creating an effective fixation to the tissues without the need to injure it by other procedures. In the case of bariatric surgery, this product has been designed to be used thanks to a 5-mm trocar laparoscopic gun, by means of which we can apply the adhesive directly on the suture generated by the endo-stapler in the section edge explained above in the technique of laparoscopic vertical gastrectomy. Objective(s): Measurement of days of admission and stay in URP, as well as necessary surgical time, intraoperative complications, hospital stay, conversion rate, re-entry less than a month after surgery and statistical analysis of the results and comparison of the results with the results in the literature in patients submitted to GVL with conventional endostapler and bioabsorbible membrane compared to those subjected to GVL with conventional endostapler and n-butyl-2-cyanocrylate. Material(s) and Method(s): We show the preliminary results of a randomized prospective study of cases and controls in which they compared 19 GVL controls with conventional endostapler and bioabsorbible membrane with 19 cases submitted to GVL with conventional endostapler and n-butyl-2-cyanocrylate. Result(s): Once the statistical analysis was applied for each of the variables, in the short-term preliminary results (intraoperative evaluation and post-operative evolution at one month), there was no statistical significance in any of them (p<0.05). Conclusion(s): Given these findings, we can conclude that there is no statistically significant difference between both groups in relation to the previously mentioned variables, although the study aims to extend the time of post-operative evaluation to measure the long-term evolution of these patients."

Weight loss improves several risk factors for CV diseases, but anti-obesity medications and lifestyle interventions have failed to modify primary CV endpoints. This paper reviews bariatric surgery in prevention of CV diseases and CV mortality, and analyzes the possible mechanisms involved., DATA SYNTHESIS: In morbidly obese patients bariatric surgery results in stable weight loss and in long-term reduction in the prevalence and incidence of obesity-related comorbidities; controlled trials have shown superiority of bariatric surgery over medical therapy in inducing significant weight loss and improvement of CV risk factors. Bariatric surgery induces several metabolic improvements (resolution of type 2 diabetes mellitus, improvement of lipid metabolism and of insulin resistance, reduction of visceral fat, of subclinical endothelial dysfunction and inflammation), and functional improvements (reduction of hypertension, of sympathetic overactivity, of left and right ventricular hypertrophy), which can explain the protective effect towards CV disease., CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of CV diseases is mediated by the pleiotropic effects of weight loss through surgery. Available data do not allow conclusions on the comparative efficacy of different surgical techniques; the choice of the surgical technique for a single patient remains an open question, and it is likely that the degree of prevention of CV diseases depends, among other factors, on the baseline conditions of patients.

The effect of high versus low sodium intake on 24BP was evaluated before and 12 months after LRYGB., RESULTS: Six weeks after LRYGB, the average weight loss was 20 kg, with a further 21 kg weight loss 1 year after surgery. In hypertensive patients, 24BP was significantly reduced at 6 weeks, but not 1 year after LRYGB. However, antihypertensive medications were successively reduced from baseline to 1 year after surgery. In normotensive patients, there was no change in 24BP 6 weeks after LRYGB, but a tendency towards a reduction 1 year after the operation. Plasma concentrations of MRproANP were subnormal prior to surgery in hypertensive patients and increased by 77% 1 year after the operation. In normotensive patients, preoperative concentrations were normal and increased only by 6%. High sodium intake induced plasma volume expansion, increased stroke volume and cardiac output, but no significant change in 24BP - neither before nor after LRYGB., CONCLUSIONS: LRYGB resulted in a significant 24BP reduction and a substantial increase in MRproANP plasma concentrations in hypertensive, obese patients 6 weeks after surgery, suggesting a causal link between obesity-hypertension and altered release/degradation of cardiac natriuretic peptides."

We aimed to evaluate the long-term relationship between metabolic surgery and MACE in such patients. Method(s): In a population-based cohort study, we compared all patients with obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM) and/or hypertension (HTN), who underwent bariatric surgery in Quebec, Canada during 2007-2012, with matched controls with obesity. The incidence of a composite MACE outcome (coronary artery events, heart failure, cerebrovascular events, and all-cause mortality) after bariatric surgery was compared between both groups. Cox regression was used to evaluate the long-term impact of surgery on MACE outcomes. Result(s): The study cohort included 3627 surgical patients, who were matched to 5420 controls with obesity. Baseline demographics were comparable between groups, but DM was more prevalent among the surgical group. Median follow-up time was 7.05 years for the study cohort (range: 5-11 years). There was a significant long-term difference in the incidence of MACE between the surgical group and controls (19.6% vs. 24.8%, respectively; p < 0.01). After accounting for confounders, bariatric surgery remained an independent protective predictor of long-term MACE (hazard ratio [HR], 0.83 [95%CI, 0.78-0.89]). The 10-year absolute risk reduction (ARR) for the surgical group was 5.14% (95%CI, 3.41-6.87). Conclusion(s): Among patients with obesity, DM and HTN, bariatric/metabolic surgery is associated with a sustained (>= 10 years) decrease in the incidence of MACE. The results from this population-level observational study should be validated in randomized controlled trials.

Anterior to posterior gastric plications were placed in the gastric fundus and body using the suturing device. The endpoints were procedure time, adverse events, weight loss, and endoscopic findings at 1, 6, and 12 months after the procedure. The nominal P values are presented., RESULTS: A total of 18 patients underwent the procedure (9 at each site). The mean age and BMI was 40 years and 38 kg/m(2), respectively. The average number of plications placed per patient was 6, and the mean procedure time was 2.1 hours (range 1.5-2.8).

Areas in need of additional investigation include refined disease definitions and interpretation of hemodynamics, as well as greater insights into noncardiac contributors to pulmonary hypertension risk, optimized animal models, and further molecular studies in patients with combined precapillary and postcapillary pulmonary hypertension. We highlight translational approaches that may provide important biological insight into pathophysiology and reveal new therapeutic targets.

POSCH addresses the therapeutic arm of the lipid_atherosclerosis theory, i.e. whether lowering of plasma cholesterol is directly related to a reduction in atherosclerosis risk. In this trial, lipid modification is accomplished by the partial ileal bypass operation. Between 1975 and 1983, 838 patients were randomized into this study. All patients were between 30 and 64 years of age, had survived one and only one electrocardiogram and enzyme_documented myocardial infarction, and had a total plasma cholesterol of at least 220 mg/dl or a low density lipoprotein (LDL)_cholesterol of at least 140 mg/dl if the total plasma cholesterol was between 200 and 219 mg/dl after a minimum of 6 weeks of dietary fat and cholesterol restriction. The primary response variable in POSCH is overall mortality. Secondary endpoints include fatal and non_fatal myocardial infarctions, serial electrocardiographic changes, and, most importantly, sequential coronary arteriography changes. The minimum follow_up is currently planned to be 7 years. Study analyses will be made primarily on the ""intention to treat"" basis. This paper is the first detailed presentation of POSCH design and methodology. Included are descriptions of study design, implementation, and data collection, including data processing, quality assurance/quality surveillance, and patient safety monitoring.

Many patients continue to be exposed to this risk due to the failure to attain target blood pressure levels due to pharmacologic resistance. The creation of a 4 mm central iliac arteriovenous anastomosis, a treatment targeting the mechanical properties of the arterial system has recently been shown to reduce average blood pressure in patients resistant to pharmacotherapy. Objectives We undertook this study to evaluate the impact of central arteriovenous fistula on 24 h peak pressures and blood pressure variability in resistant hypertensive patients. Methods In this open_label, multicentre, prospective, randomised trial, patients with elevated blood pressure despite therapy were randomised to undergo implantation of an AV coupler device along with previous treatment, or to maintain previous treatment alone. All patients underwent ABPM at baseline and at 6 months. Results Data is presented on 75 patients who were randomised to arteriovenous coupler therapy (n = 40) or control (n = 35) groups. Peak systolic pressures during the 24 h period were reduced by 17.4 +/_ 22.1 mmHg, (p < 0.0001) in the AV Coupler group, and by 4.4 +/_ 23.9 mmHg (p = 0.22) in the control group. Measures of 24 h blood pressure variability such as average real variability (ARV) and time weighted standard deviation (wSD) were both significantly reduced in the treatment group for both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (ARV reduction of 1.4/1.5 mmHg and wSD reduction of 2.6/1.7 mmHg, p < 0.05 for all). Conclusions In this study we have shown a reduction in blood pressure variability following iliac AV anastomosis creation. The coupling of blood pressure reduction and cushioning of blood pressure peaks and BP variation over the 24_hour period may be of benefit for patients with uncontrolled hypertension."

Castro Cabezas	Interventions in type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular mortality-An overview of clinical trials	2017	https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejim.2017.04.017		"Diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM) has been associated with an increased cardiovascular risk. Improving glycaemia or other traditional cardiovascular risk factors may reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with T2DM. However, single risk intervention in T2DM has not provided convincing evidence in the reduction of cardiovascular risk. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of clinical trials involving reduction of cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2DM. Trials with glucose lowering therapies have shown conflicting results. Intensive therapy to reduce glycaemia has shown some benefit on composite cardiovascular endpoints but these benefits take a longer period to emerge. Recent studies with empagliflozin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists show promising results, but the mechanisms are most likely not mediated by improved glycaemia, given the relatively rapid effects. Both LDL-cholesterol and blood pressure reduction have been proven by large meta-analysis to reduce both cardiovascular events and mortality in all patients with T2DM. Treatment of microalbuminuria and anti-platelet therapy have only been proven in diabetic patients with increased cardiovascular risk. Classical lifestyle interventions have been disappointing with respect to cardiovascular outcome, possibly due to limited weight reduction. So far, the strongest evidence lies on bariatric surgery and a multifactorial intervention to reduce mortality and cardiovascular events in the long term.

Methods. Patients were randomized to an Intensive Lifestyle Intervention (ILI) (n = 60) or Conventional Obesity Therapy (COT) (n = 46). The ILI group received behavioral therapy and nutritional counseling. The COT group received standard medical treatment. They were compared with a third group, Surgical Obesity Group (SOG) (n = 37). Results. Patients who received ILI had a greater percentage of weight loss than patients receiving COT (_11.3% versus_1.6%; p < 0.0044).

Lumiracoxib is metabolized extensively with only a small amount excreted in the urine. Selectivity for COX_2 is high compared to all other similar agents. It is indicated for the relief of pain in osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, acute pain and primary dysmenorrhea. Lumiracoxib has been found to be effective at doses of 100_400 mg once a day for chronic pain and 400 mg/day for acute pain. Large clinical trials where lumiracoxib was administered to patients with osteoarthritis have demonstrated that this drug is equally effective as other COX_2 inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti_inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In comparison to NSAIDs, patients taking lumiracoxib experience significantly fewer adverse events and greater tolerability. It has also been shown to be effective in acute pain states, like the dental pain model and postoperative pain after orthopedic surgery. A large clinical study (TARGET) has demonstrated the gastrointestinal safety of lumiracoxib over one year. The study also showed that there was no increase in cardiovascular events in non_high_risk patients. However, a black box warning similar to those accompanying other COX_2 inhibitors has been placed by regulatory agencies that have approved this drug for clinical use. When lumiracoxib is coadministered with warfarin or aspirin, no dosage adjustment is required."

It is reported that obesity in patients with hypertension can lead to resistance to pressure reduction through pharmacological therapy and lifestyle changes, so bariatric surgery emerges as a proposed treatment for obesity., METHODS: We performed an umbrella review that included systematic reviews of clinical trials that evaluated patients with hypertension and non-morbid obesity. The quality and certainty of the evidence was evaluated with the AMSTAR-II and GRADE tools., RESULTS: 677 systematic reviews were identified, of which only three were included for analysis. We considered the outcomes addressed by the reviews on hypertension, identifying that 5 RCTs evaluated pressure reduction at 1 year of follow-up and 5 RCTs at more than 1 year, 5 RCTs evaluated hypertension rate, 6 RCTs analyzed changes in systolic pressure and 5 RCTs changes in diastolic pressure. Likewise, when assessing the methodological quality, it was concluded that the three reviews have critically low quality., CONCLUSIONS: We found only three systematic reviews that evaluated the topic with critically low methodological quality. They reported results in favor of metabolic surgery, but with very low certainty of evidence. Copyright .. 2022 IJS Publishing Group Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Ventilation settings followed two distinct algorithms aiming to maintain end-tidal CO(2) (E'(CO(2))) between 4.40 and 4.66 kPa and plateau pressure (P(plateau)) as low as possible. Primary outcome variable was peroperative P(plateau). Secondary outcomes were Pa(O(2)) (Fi(O(2)) at 0.6 in each group) and Pa(CO(2)) during surgery and 2 h after extubation. Pressure, flow, and volume time curves were recorded., RESULTS: There were no significant differences in patient characteristics and co-morbidity in the two groups. Mean pH, Pa(O(2)), Sa(O(2)), and the Pa(O(2))/Fi(O(2)) ratio were higher in the PCV group, whereas Pa(CO(2)) and the E'(CO(2))-Pa(CO(2)) gradient were lower (all P<0.05). Ventilation variables, including plateau and mean airway pressures, anaesthesia-related variables, and postoperative cardiovascular variables, blood gases, and morphine requirements after the operation were similar., CONCLUSIONS: The changes in oxygenation can only be explained by an improvement in the lungs ventilation/perfusion ratio. The decelerating inspiratory flow used in PCV generates higher instantaneous flow peaks and may allow a better alveolar recruitment. PCV improves oxygenation without any side-effects."

The persistence of favorable results after 6 months has not been tested in a controlled study., METHODS: We conducted a multicenter randomized controlled trial, stratified by center and diabetes status. The primary endpoint was the remission of MS at 12 months. The secondary endpoints included body mass index (BMI), glucose control, blood pressure, and lipids, assessed at 12 months after implantation, and again, at 12 months after the removal of the DJBL. Up to 174 subjects were planned to be randomized into either the DJBL or the control arm at a 2:1 ratio, respectively. Study enrollment was discontinued by the Scientific Monitoring Committee due to the early termination of the ENDO trial (NCT01728116) by the US Food and Drug Administration. The study was terminated after withdrawal of the device's European Conformity marking by the European Medicines Agency, and an interim analysis was performed., RESULTS: A total of 82 patients were enrolled (67.5% female, 48.8% with diabetes). At 12 months after randomization, the primary endpoint was met in 6 (12%) DJBL patients and 3 (10%) controls (P = 0.72). Patients in the DJBL group experienced greater BMI loss [mean adjusted difference (95% confidence interval, CI) -3.1 kg/m (-4.4 to -1.9) kg/m, P < 0.001] and HbA1c change [mean adjusted difference -0.5% (95% CI -0.9 to -0.2); P < 0.001] than those in the control group. No difference remained statistically significant at 12 months after the removal of the DJBL. In the DJBL group, 39% of patients experienced at least one device-related serious adverse event, which was classified as Grade III Dindo-Clavien in 22%, and required premature device explantation in 16%., CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed a transient clinical benefit of DJBL, which was only apparent at 1 year, when the device was still in situ, and was obtained at the risk of serious device-related adverse events in 39% of patients. These results do not support the routine use of DJBL for weight loss and glucose control in patients with MS."

Study aimed to evaluate: (a) the effect of INDIVIDUO on weight and metabolic control; (b) the impact of INDIVIDUO on psychosocial variables associated with successful weight-control., METHODS: Two-arms randomised controlled single-site study, with six-month duration. Patients were recruited from an Obesity Treatment Unit's waiting list. For the intervention group (IG), an operating procedure manual was used, nutritionists received training/supervision regarding INDIVIDUO's procedures. Control group (CG) received health literacy-promoting intervention. Intention-to-treat and per-control analysis were used. Outcomes included weight, metabolic control variables (blood pressure, glycemia, insulinemia, triglycerides, cholesterol), measures of eating and physical activity patterns, hedonic hunger, autonomous/controlled regulation, perceived competence for diet (PCS-diet) and quality of life. Primary outcomes were weight and metabolic control. Effect size was estimated by odds ratio and Cohens'd coefficient., RESULTS: Overall, 94 patients participated (IG:45; CG:49) and 60 completed the study (IG:29; CG:31).

By decreasing obesity-associated hyperfiltration, diabetes, and hypertension, RYGB is touted to stabilize, if not prevent, progression of chronic renal disease. To test this, the renal histology of diet-induced obese rats that underwent RYGB surgery was compared with that of pair-fed and sham obese controls., METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats, fed a high-fat, low-oxalate diet to induce gross obesity, were randomized to RYGB (n = 6), gastrointestinal-intact sham-operated obese controls (sham, n = 4), or gastrointestinal-intact sham-operated obese pair-fed controls (fed, n = 8). Daily body weight and food intake were recorded. On postoperative day 42, renal histology and immunohistochemistry were examined. Renal pathology was assessed by a categorical glomerular lesion score and a quantitative glomerular/tubular scoring system by experienced veterinary pathologists. Osteopontin and ED-1 (monocyte/macrophage cell) stainings were estimated by the percentage of stained area and the number of counted cells/high-power field, respectively., RESULTS: Compared with sham and fed controls, RYGB rats had significant decreases in body weight (P < 0.001), more glomerular lesions (P = 0.02), and received higher glomerular and tubular lesion scores (P < 0.01). RYGB rodents had significantly stronger staining for osteopontin within the inner medullary region (P < 0.005) and ED-1 within the outer medullary region (P < 0.02) compared with sham and fed controls., CONCLUSION: In this diet-induced obese rat model, RYGB is associated with chronic glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial nephritis, confirmed by histology and immunohistochemistry.

Here, we hypothesized that combining rapidly and slowly fermentable fibers will enhance distal colonic acetate production and improve metabolic health. In vitro cultivation studies in a validated model of the colon were used to identify fiber mixtures that yielded high distal colonic acetate production. Subsequently, in two randomized crossover studies, lean and prediabetic overweight/obese men were included. In one study, participants received supplements of either long_chain inulin+resistant starch (INU+RS), INU or maltodextrin (PLA) the day prior to a clinical investigation day (CID). The second trial studied beta glucan+RS (BG+RS) versus BG and PLA. During each CID, breath hydrogen, indirect calorimetry, plasma metabolites/hormones were assessed during fasting and postprandial conditions. Additionally, fecal microbiota composition and SCFA were determined. In prediabetic men, INU+RS increased plasma acetate compared to INU or PLA (P < .05), but did not affect metabolic parameters. In lean men, INU+RS increased breath hydrogen and fasting plasma butyrate, which was accompanied by increased energy expenditure, carbohydrate oxidation and PYY and decreased postprandial glucose concentrations (all P < .05) compared to PLA. BG+RS increased plasma butyrate compared to PLA (P < .05) in prediabetic individuals, but did not affect other fermentation/metabolic markers in both phenotypes. Fiber_induced shifts in fecal microbiota were individual_specific and more pronounced with INU+RS versus BG+RS. Administration of INU+RS (not BG+RS) the day prior to investigation improved metabolic parameters in lean but not in prediabetic individuals, demonstrating that effects were phenotype_ and fiber_specific. Further research should study whether longer_term supplementation periods are required to elicit beneficial metabolic health in prediabetic individuals.

C. Cardillo	Drug treatments to restore vascular function and diabesity	2013	https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pharma.2012.09.001		"Over the last decades, an escalating rate of type 2 diabetes has paralleled an epidemic rise in the prevalence of obesity. Both diabetes and obesity confer an increased risk of cardiovascular comorbidities, including hypertension, coronary artery disease and stroke. Vascular dysfunction, represented by impaired endothelial release of vasodilator substances or defective smooth muscle vasodilator reactivity, is the early stage of the process leading to atherosclerosis and a common finding in patients with diabesity. It is understandable, therefore, that effective treatments for diabesity should restore vascular function to prevent the development of cardiovascular disease. Recent evidence from clinical studies supports the efficacy of incretin-based antidiabetic therapies for vascular protection. Thus, glucose control with either DDP-4 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor therapies seems associated with favorable effects on vascular function in diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Another mechanism to counter excess plasma glucose and reduce body weight in these patients may rely on drug therapies targeting gut hormones, as suggested by the efficacy of bariatric surgery to produce both sustained weight loss and high diabetes remission rates. Also, as knowledge of the multifaceted vascular actions of adipokines and their dysregulation in patients with diabesity increases, these substances become attractive targets for treatments aimed at cardiovascular prevention. The increasing coexistence of diabetes and obesity presents complex treatment challenges owing to the elevated risk of developing cardiovascular complications. Hence, therapeutic strategies integrating glycemic control, weight loss and vascular protection are of the greatest importance to successfully counteract the health and economic burden posed by diabesity. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS."

Despite daily supplementation with 800 IU VitD and 1500 mg calcium after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), VitD depletion persists in almost one half (44%) of patients. However, the optimal management of VitD depletion after RYGB and the potential benefits of such treatment are currently unknown. Method(s): A total of 60 VitD-depleted morbidly obese women were randomly assigned to receive 50,000 IU of VitD weekly after RYGB (group 1; n = 30) or no additional VitD after RYGB (group 2; n = 30). All patients received a daily supplement of 800 IU VitD and 1500 mg calcium. The serum calcium, parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, urinary N-telopeptide, and bone mineral density were measured preoperatively and 1 year after RYGB. Questionnaires were used to assess other potential sources of VitD, including sunlight exposure and ingestion of VitD-containing foods/liquids. Result(s): At 1 year after RYGB, VitD depletion and mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D level had improved significantly in group 1 (14% and 37.8 ng/mL, respectively) compared with the values in group 2 (85% and 15.2 ng/mL, respectively; P <.001 for both). A significant 33% retardation in hip bone mineral density decline (P = .043) and a significantly greater resolution of hypertension was seen in group 1 (75% versus 32%; P = .029). No significant adverse effects were encountered from pharmacologic VitD therapy. Conclusion(s): The results of our study have shown that 50,000 IU of VitD weekly after RYGB safely corrects VitD depletion in most women, attenuates cortical bone loss, and improves resolution of hypertension. © 2009 American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery."

We systematically searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases. The studies selected were those in which an exercise-based intervention was performed after bariatric surgery, a control group was present, and at least one of the following outcomes was investigated: VO2max or VO2peak, resting heart rate (RHR), blood pressure, lipid profile, glucose, and insulin. The study quality was assessed using the PEDro scale and the data were meta-analyzed with a random effects model, comparing control groups to intervention groups using standardized measurements. Twenty articles were included in the systematic review and fourteen (70%) in the meta-analysis. Significant differences were observed between the control and intervention groups (always in favor of exercise) for absolute VO2max / VO2peak (ES = 0.317; 95% CI = 0.065, 0.569; p = 0.014), VO2max / peak relative to body weight (ES = 0.673; 95% CI = 0.287, 1.060; p = 0.001), HDL cholesterol (ES = 0.22; 95% CI = 0.009, 0.430; p = 0.041) and RHR (ES = -0.438; 95% CI = -0.753, -0.022; p = 0.007). No effects were observed for either systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Exercise training for patients undergoing bariatric surgery appears to be effective in improving absolute and relative VO2max / VO2peak, HDL cholesterol and reducing the RHR. More intervention studies using (better) exercise interventions are needed before discarding their effects on other cardiometabolic risk factors.

Th e objective of this study was to compare off_pump to onpump CABG in patients with known risk factors for mortality and morbidity. METHODS: Between October 2001 and September 2002, 65 high_risk patients were prospectively randomized to undergo off_pump or o n_pump CABG. Recruited patients had at least 3 of the following criteria: age greater than 65 years, high blood pressure, diabetes, serum creatinine greater than 133 mol/L, left ventricular ejection fraction lower than 45%, chronic pulmonary diseas e, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, repeat CABG, anemia, and carotid atherosclerosis. Hospital mortality and morbidity were the primary end_points of the study. RESULTS: Six patients (9%) crossed over from the original randomized group. Twenty_eight patients averaging 70 +/_ 8 years of age underwent 3 +/_ 1 grafts off pump, and 37 patients averaging 70 +/_ 6 years of age underwent 3.4 +/_ 1 grafts on pump.

The primary outcome objective of this study was to test whether, in comparison with the endotracheal tube (ETT), the Proseal TM Laryngeal Mask Airway (PLMA TM) (Laryngeal Mask Airway Company, Jersey, United Kingdom) reduces blood pressure and norepinephrine responses and the amounts of muscle relaxants needed in obese patients., METHODS: We assessed hemodynamic and hormonal stress responses, ventilation, and postoperative recovery in 75 morbidly obese patients randomized to receive standardized anesthesia with either an ETT or the PLMA TM for laparoscopic gastric banding., RESULTS: In repeated-measures ANOVA, mean arterial blood pressure and plasma norepinephrine were significantly higher in the ETT group than in the PLMA TM group. In individual pairwise comparisons, blood pressure rose higher in ETT than PLMA TM patients after insertion and removal of airway devices, and after recovery. In ETT compared with PLMA TM patients, plasma norepinephrine was higher after induction of carboperitoneum (mean +/- SD, 534 +/- 198 and 368 +/- 147 and pg/ml, P = 0.001), after airway device removal (578 +/- 285 and 329 +/- 128 pg/ml, P < 0.0001), and after recovery in postanesthesia care unit (380 +/- 167 and 262 +/- 95 and pg/ml, P = 0.003).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether a 12-week aerobic exercise program positively impacts heart rate variability (HRV) and functional capacity after gastric bypass surgery (GBS) in a female cohort., METHODS: Of the 52 patients initially recruited, 21 were randomized to a training group (TG) or control group and successfully completed the study. Patients were tested on two occasions: 1 week before GBS and 4 months after GBS. Anthropometric variables, body composition, record of heart rate and R-R intervals, and 6-min walk test (6MWT) were assessed at both time points. The TG underwent an aerobic exercise training program on a treadmill (1-h session, totaling 36 sessions over 12 weeks)., RESULTS: The main findings from this study were: (1) only the TG demonstrated a significant increase (p < 0.05) in all indexes of heart rate variability (HRV) after 12 weeks of aerobic exercise training and (2) only the TG demonstrated a significant increase (p < 0.05) in 6MWT distance and decrease in diastolic blood pressure after aerobic exercise training., CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that 12 weeks of aerobic exercise training improves cardiac autonomic modulation and functional capacity 4 months after GBS."

The primary endpoint of this study was a joint hypothesis during the 36-month follow-up: the first primary outcome pertained to the frequency of patients with an excess weight loss (EWL) greater than 50% (% EWL>50%) after LSG or RYGB; the second primary outcome was defined as a composite endpoint of at least one major complication. Secondary objectives were regression of comorbidities and improvement in quality of life., RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-seven patients were included (91 RYGBP, 186 LSG). The mean age was 41.1+/-11.1 years, and average preoperative body mass index of 45.3+/-5.5kg/m2. After 36months, the %EWL>50% was not inferior in the case of LSG (82.2%) relative to LRYGB (82.1%); while major complications rates were significantly higher in LRYGB (15.4%) vs. LSG (5.4%, P=0.005). After 36months, all secondary objectives were comparable between groups while only gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) increased in LSG group and decreased in LRYGB group., CONCLUSIONS: LSG was found non-inferior to LRYGB with respect to weight loss and was associated with lower risk of major complications during a 3-year follow-up. But GERD increased in LSG group and decreased in LRYGB group. Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS."
"J. Cawley, T. Prinz and S. Beane"	Health insurance claims data as a means of assessing reduction in co-morbidities 6 months after bariatric surgery	2006			"BACKGROUND: We measured the very short-term change in obesity-related co-morbidities following bariatric surgery., METHODS: Claims data were analyzed for 933 patients aged 18-62 who were covered by one of 11 New York State health plans and underwent bariatric surgery during calendar year 2002. Data covered 6 months before to 6 months after surgery. Logit regression and fixed effects logit regressions were estimated, to analyze change in the following co-morbidities after bariatric surgery: diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, asthma, sleep apnea, degenerative joint disease, gastroesophageal reflux, and depression., RESULTS: There were statistically significant post-surgery decreases in each outcome studied. Controlling for individual fixed effects, the probability of a diabetes diagnosis fell by 20% after bariatric surgery. The probability of sleep apnea fell by 33%, and the probability of the other obesity-related co-morbidities fell by 11 to 19% at 6 months., CONCLUSION: Claims data are useful for assessing changes in a wide range of co-morbidities following bariatric surgery. The data indicate significant decreases in obesity-related co-morbidities after bariatric surgery, although considerably smaller than those found in previous studies, which underscores the need for randomized controlled trials of bariatric surgery. Limitations of this study include: follow-up only at 6 months, non-experimental data, and an unknown degree of under-reporting of co-morbidities in claims data."

Yazbeck"	Effect of vital capacity manoeuvres on arterial oxygenation in morbidly obese patients undergoing open bariatric surgery	2007			"BACKGROUND: Arterial oxygenation may be compromised in morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a vital capacity manoeuvre (VCM), followed by ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), on arterial oxygenation in morbidly obese patients undergoing open bariatric surgery., METHODS: Fifty-two morbidly obese patients (body mass index >40 kg m-2) undergoing open bariatric surgery were enrolled in this prospective and randomized study. Anaesthesia and surgical techniques were standardized. Patients were ventilated with a tidal volume of 10 mL kg-1 of ideal body weight, a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide (FiO2 = 40%) and respiratory rate was adjusted to maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide at a level of 30-35 mmHg. After abdominal opening, patients in Group 1 had a PEEP of 8 cm H2O applied and patients in Group 2 had a VCM followed by PEEP of 8 cm H2O. This manoeuvre was defined as lung inflation by a positive inspiratory pressure of 40 cm H2O maintained for 15 s. PEEP was maintained until extubation in the two groups. Haemodynamics, ventilatory and arterial oxygenation parameters were measured at the following times: T0 = before application of VCM and/or PEEP, T1 = 5 min after VCM and/or PEEP and T2 = before abdominal closure., RESULTS: Patients in the two groups were comparable regarding patient characteristics, surgical, haemodynamic and ventilatory parameters. In Group 1, arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) and arterial haemoglobin oxygen saturation (SaO2) were significantly increased and alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure gradient (A-aDO2) decreased at T2 when compared with T0 and T1. In Group 2, PaO2 and SaO2 were significantly increased and A-aDO2 decreased at T1 and T2 when compared with T0. Arterial oxygenation parameters at T1 and T2 were significantly improved in Group 2 when compared with Group 1., CONCLUSION: The addition of VCM to PEEP improves intraoperative arterial oxygenation in morbidly obese patients undergoing open bariatric surgery."

Following its success in adults, and with limited success using conservative therapies, metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is increasingly being utilized in adolescents. This review highlights the current evidence and guidelines supporting its use. Recent Findings: Safety and efficacy mirror results seen in adults. The most recent evidence, as outcomes enter the long term, suggests that comorbidity resolution, including diabetes and hypertension, can even outperform that of adults. Mental health problems persist despite good weight loss. Overall, the positive early weight and comorbidity outcomes are well sustained into the long term. Summary: There is a growing need to prevent and treat adolescent obesity. Current evidence supports the use of MBS in adolescents. Ongoing and future studies will provide 10-year outcomes and assist in the refinement of multimodal pathways incorporating MBS for the treatment of severe childhood obesity.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s)."

Champault"	Quality of life after laparoscopic gastric banding: Prospective study (152 cases) with a follow-up of 2 years	2006			"To evaluate influence of laparoscopic gastric banding (LGB) on quality of life (QOL) in patients with morbid obesity. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding is a popular bariatric operation in Europe. The objectives of surgical therapy in patients with morbid obesity are reduction of body weight, and a positive influence on the obesity-related comorbidity as well the concomitant psychologic and social restrictions of these patients. In a prospective clinical trial, development of the individual patient QOL was analyzed, after LGB in patients with morbid obesity. From October 1999 to January 2001, 152 patients [119 women, 33 men, mean age 38.4 y (range 24 to 62), mean body mass index 44.3 (range 38 to 63)] underwent evaluation for LGB according the following protocol: history of obesity; concise counseling of patients and relative on nonsurgical treatment alternatives, risk of surgery, psychologic testing, questionnaire for eating habits, necessity of lifestyle change after surgery; medical evaluation including endocrinologic and nutritionist work-up, upper GI endoscopy, evaluation of QOL using the Gastro Intestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI). Decision for surgery was a multidisciplinary consensus. This group was follow-up at least 2 years, focusing on weight loss and QOL. Mean operative time was 82 minutes; mean hospital stay was 2.3 days and the mean follow-up period was 34 months. The BMI dropped from 44.3 to 29.6 kg/m and all comorbid conditions improved markedly: diabetes melitus resolved in 71% of the patients, hypertension in 33%, and sleep apnea in 90%. However, 26 patients (17%) had late complications requiring reoperation. Preoperative global GIQLI score was 95 (range 56 to 140), significant different of the healthy volunteers score (120) (70 to 140) P < 0.001. Correlated with weight loss (percentage loss of overweight and BMI), the global score of the group increased to 100 at 3 months, 104 at 6, 111 at 1 year to reach 119 at 2 years which is no significant different of healthy patients. Analyzing the subscale, physical condition, emotional status, and social integration increased significantly (P < 0.001) from preoperative to end of follow-up. Digestive symptoms were not modified. In case of failure of the procedure (10.5%) global Giqli score is not modified. Patients who have required successful revisional surgery for late complications (6.5%) have an excellent QOL outcome that are not different from the whole group. Together with a satisfactory reduction of the excess overweight, laparoscopic gastric banding may lead in a carefully selected population of patients with morbid obesity to a significant improvement of patient QOL, in at least 2 years follow-up."

Harper"	440: Early gestational diabetes screening in class III obesity (BMI>=40)	2020	https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2019.11.456		"Objective: A recent randomized controlled trial suggested that early gestational diabetes (GDM) screening (14-20wks) in women with obesity (defined as BMI >=30) does not improve GDM-related outcomes. However, ACOG recommends that obese women without other risk factors be screened only if BMI 340 kg/m2. We aim to evaluate whether early screening for GDM improves pregnancy outcomes in patients with BMI >=40. Study Design: This was a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial performed at the University of Alabama at Birmingham of obese women with singleton non-anomalous gestations comparing early GDM screening (14-20wga) to routine (24-28wga). Women were included in this analysis if BMI>=40 kg/m2. Exclusion criteria were pregestational diabetes, major medical illnesses (cardiac, hemoglobinopathy, prednisone), bariatric surgery, and prior cesarean. An intention to treat analysis was performed with patient characteristics and outcomes compared by randomization group. Chi squared test of association was performed for categorical measures with relative risks calculated for outcomes. Student T-test and Wilcoxon rank sum test were used to compare continuous variables. Primary outcome was a composite primary cesarean, macrosomia (>4000g), pregnancy-induced hypertension, neonatal hypoglycemia (< 40 mg/dL), or neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Secondary outcome was a composite in patients diagnosed with GDM (Table 2). Result(s): Of 954 women in the original study, 218 (23%) women were included for analysis. 111 were randomized to early screening and 107 were randomized to routine screening. Baseline characteristics (age, race, BMI, insurance status, and parity) across groups were similar. Early screening did not reduce the incidence of the primary outcome (Table 1). Of the women who were diagnosed with GDM, there was no change in primary composite (Table 2). Conclusion(s): In women with BMI >=40 kg/m2, early GDM screening is not beneficial. Recommendations for early GDM screening in this population should continue to be evaluated. [Formula presented] [Formula presented]Copyright © 2019"

Navaneethan"	Bariatric Surgery and Kidney-Related Outcomes	2017	https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ekir.2017.01.010		"The prevalence of severe obesity in both the general and the chronic kidney disease (CKD) populations continues to rise, with more than one-fifth of CKD patients in the United States having a body mass index of >=35 kg/m2. Severe obesity has significant renal consequences, including increased risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and nephrolithiasis. Bariatric surgery represents an effective method for achieving sustained weight loss, and evidence from randomized controlled trials suggests that bariatric surgery is also effective in improving blood pressure, reducing hyperglycemia, and even inducing diabetes remission. There is also observational evidence suggesting that bariatric surgery may diminish the long-term risk of kidney function decline and ESRD. Bariatric surgery appears to be relatively safe in patients with CKD, with postoperative complications only slightly higher than in the general bariatric surgery population. The use of bariatric surgery in patients with CKD might help prevent progression to ESRD or enable selected ESRD patients with severe obesity to become candidates for kidney transplantation. However, there are also renal risks in bariatric surgery, namely, acute kidney injury, nephrolithiasis, and, in rare cases, oxalate nephropathy, particularly in types of surgery involving higher degrees of malabsorption. Although bariatric surgery may improve long-term kidney outcomes, this potential benefit remains unproved and must be balanced with potential adverse events."

Foss-Freitas	Alpha-linolenic acid supplementation effects on endoplasmic reticulum stress in visceral adipose tissue from morbid obese patients	2018	https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13098-018-0315-8		"Alpha-linolenic acid supplementation effects on endoplasmic reticulum stress in visceral adipose tissue from morbid obese patients. 2017. Tese (Doutorado)-Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, 2017. Currently, obesity is considered a worldwide epidemic. It is associated with chronic inflammation and stress activation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ERE), related to the pathogenesis of various diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, hypertension, among others. In this context, studies are needed to find alternatives that improve the inflammatory process. Several studies in humans and animals have already demonstrated the anti-inflammatory properties of omega-3 fatty acid. The objective of our study was to evaluate the effects of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) supplementation on the metabolism and stress of the endoplasmic reticulum in obese patients. A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was conducted. In total, 52 patients were randomized to supplementation with 3 g/day of ALA or placebo, 27 individuals from the omega-3/ALA group and 25 from the control group. Lipid, glycidic and inflammatory profile were evaluated before and after supplementation. Visceral adipose tissue (TAV) was collected during bariatric surgery after supplementation. The fatty acid profile incorporated in the TAV was evaluated by gas chromatography. Genes were evaluated by real-time PCR. There was no change in serum levels of IL-6 (p = 0.2201), TNF-alpha (0.7703) and CRP (p = 0.57) after supplementation with ALA, but we observed a decrease in serum Leptin levels (P = 0.0154) and IP-10 (p = 0.0410), inflammatory cytokines, and increase in IL-4 (p = 0.0211), antiinflammatory cytokine. Significant incorporation of ALA (p = 0.0002), EPA (p < 0.0001) and DHA (p = 0.0005) into the TAV was observed. Molecular evaluation showed an increase in the gene expression of XBP1 (p = 0.0013), sXBP1 (p < 0.0001), EIF2-alpha (p = 0.0063), GADD34 (p = 0.0117) and CCT4 chaperone (p = 0.0001), decrease in the gene expression of leptin (p = 0.0410) and ATF-6 (p = 0.0305) and a tendency to decrease the gene expression of CHOP. We can conclude that ALA can modulate ERE through the IRE1/XBP, PERK and ATF-6 pathways, leading to increased chaperones (CCT4), which may demonstrate a therapeutic potential of ALA in obese patients."

METHODS: Elderly patients (>65 years) undergoing selective gastrectomy were randomly assigned to three groups (n = 80): general anesthesia (Group A); general + INB anesthesia (Group B); or, general + epidural anesthesia (Group C). General anesthesia was maintained with propofol, remifentanil and cisatracurium. The mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and C_reactive protein (CRP) levels were determined before anesthesia (T0) and at 5 min after intubation (T1), skin incision (T2), exploration of the peritoneal cavity (T3), gastrointestinal anastomosis (T4), end of operation (T5) and 10 min after extubation (T6). RESULTS: MAP decreased at T1 in all groups (P < 0.05) and at T2, T4 and T5 in Group C (P < 0.05) and was lower in Group C than Group B at T2 and T4 (P < 0.05). There were no differences in MAP between Groups A and B or between Groups B and C. HR increased at T2_T6 in Group A (P < 0.05) and was higher at T2_T6 in Group B and Group C (P < 0.05). CRP levels decreased at T2_T5 in Groups B and C (P < 0.05) and were lower in Groups B and C compared with Group A (P < 0.05). Propofol and remifentanil doses were lower in Groups B and C (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively) and patients recovered faster than in Group A (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Administration of INB with general anesthesia enhanced analgesia, led to stable hemodynamics, and reduced anaesthetic consumption and postoperative stress response."

These changes result in insulin resistance, chronic vascular inflammation, oxidative stress, and activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), eventually leading to type 2 diabetes, obesity-related hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Several trials have shown that bariatric surgery significantly reduces these comorbidities. However, there is a gap in knowledge regarding the mechanisms whereby bariatric surgery reduces the burden of CVD in obese individuals., METHOD: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were isolated from adipose tissue collected from three groups: (1) nonobese control subjects, (2) obese subjects undergoing gastric bypass surgery (GBS), and (3) subjects 1 year or more after GBS. In the study, MSCs were induced to adipogenic differentiation, and RAS-related gene expressions were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The effect of angiotensin II (Ang II) on adipogenic differentiation of MSCs also was investigated., RESULTS: Angiotensinogen mRNA levels in MSCs and differentiated adipocytes were significantly higher in the obese group than in the nonobese control subjects. Renin mRNA levels were significantly higher in the obese group MSCs than in the nonobese and post-GBS groups. Angiotensin-converting enzyme mRNA levels were significantly lower in the MSCs derived from the post-GBS group than in the obese and nonobese control subjects. Serum Ang II levels were significantly lower in the post-GBS group (52.1 +/- 4.2 pg/ml) than in the nonobese (85.4 +/- 12.4 pg/ml) and obese (84.7 +/- 10.0 pg/ml) groups. Ang II treatment inhibited adipogenesis of MSCs in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect of Ang II was mainly abolished by PD123319, a receptor 2 blocker., CONCLUSIONS: The adipogenesis of MSCs is inhibited by Ang II treatment. Obese individuals are characterized by an upregulation of the RAS-related gene expressions in adipose tissue. This upregulation resolves in post-GBS subjects."

K. Chintam and A. R. Chang	Strategies to Treat Obesity in Patients With CKD	2021	https://dx.doi.org/10.1053/j.ajkd.2020.08.016		"Obesity prevalence continues to increase worldwide, accompanied by a rising tide of hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although body mass index is typically used to assess obesity in clinical practice, altered body composition (eg, reduced muscle mass and increased visceral adiposity) are common among patients with CKD. Weight loss achieved through behavioral modification or medications reduces albuminuria and in some cases slows the decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate. Use of medications that promote weight loss with favorable cardiovascular risk profiles should be promoted, particularly in patients with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and CKD. For those who fail to achieve weight loss through lifestyle modification, bariatric surgery should be considered because observational studies have shown reductions in risk for estimated glomerular filtration rate decline and kidney failure. Uncertainty persists on the risk to benefit ratio of intentional weight loss in patients with kidney failure due to the lack of prospective trials and limitations of observational data. Regardless, sleeve gastrectomy is increasingly being used for patients with kidney failure and severe obesity, with success in achieving sustained weight loss, improved access to kidney transplantation, and favorable posttransplantation outcomes. More research is needed assessing long-term cardiovascular and kidney outcomes of most weight loss medications. Copyright © 2020 National Kidney Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

N. Chirakalwasan	Osa in bariatric population; current evidence among asians	2016	https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/resp.12939-7		"Obesity is a growing epidemic. Worldwide obesity has more than doubled since 1980. Morbid obesity is defined by BMI > 35 kg/m2 with obesityrelated comorbidities or BMI > 40 kg/m2. Treatment for morbid obesity can be divided into life style modification and bariatric surgery. Several comorbidities were associated with obesity such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), dyslipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is defined according to the 3rd international classification of sleep disorders (ICSD 3) using one of the two criteria 1 1. Respiratory disturbance index (RDI) >= 5 events per hour + one of OSArelated symptoms or OSA-related comorbidities 2. Respiratory disturbance index (RDI) >= 15 events per hour Obesity is one of the important risk factors for OSA. Generally, prevalence of OSA has been demonstrated to be approximately 4% in men and 2% in women using apnea hypopnea index (AHI) >= 5 events per hour plus excessive daytime sleepiness. Prevalence has been demonstrated to be as high as 24% in male and 9% in female using AHI >=5 events per hour alone. 2 In the population of morbid obesity patients undergoing bariatric surgery, the reported prevalence was much higher ranging between 72-94% using AHI >=5 events per hour. 3-6 Recent report from King Chulalongkorn memorial hospital, Bangkok, Thailand during the period of 2007 to 2015 on 238 morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery demonstrated prevalence of OSA to be 85.7%. Severity of OSA was classified into mild, moderate, and severe in 8.8%, 15.3%, and 75.9%; respectively. The three most common comorbidities were hypertension (60.9%), fatty liver disease (60.5%), and dyslipidemia (53.8%). The three most common OSA-related symptoms were snoring (85.3%), morning headache (37.4%), and nocturia (28.2%). Mean total AHI, total RDI, mean oxygen saturation, and nadir oxygen saturation were 71.1 +/- 48.2, 71.8 +/- 47.7, 88.2 +/- 10.7, and 72.2 +/- 15.4; respectively. Sleep-related hypoventilation was shown in 52%. BMI, fatty liver disease, snoring, and STOP-Bang score > 3 were significantly correlated with OSA compared to the patients without OSA (OR; 1.04 [1.0009-1.09], 4.75 [1.82-12.37], 17.04 [6.67-43.49], and 16 [1.95-131.11]); respectively. BMI and dyslipidemia were significantly correlated with severe OSA compared to non-severe OSA (OR; 1.07 [1.03-1.13] and 3.06 [1.36-6.89]); respectively. 7 Interestingly, we reported higher prevalence of severe OSA when comparison was made with previously published paper. The potential explanation was the relatively higher BMI observed in our study (52.6 +/- 11.6) compared to previously published paper (ranged from 42 +/- 7.3 to 52). This finding coincided with our previously published data indicated that the obese OSA group compared to the non-obese group, there was significantly more severe OSA demonstrated by higher RDI. 8 Association between OSA and intraoperative and postoperative complications has been demonstrated in many studies. There is a systematic review demonstrating statistically significant relationship between OSA and perioperative complications 9. For the effect of bariatric surgery on OSA, there was a randomized controlled trial published in JAMA comparing surgical therapy and conventional therapy for weight loss. At 2 yearfollow- up, the surgical therapy group achieved AHI reduction of 25.5 events per hour (95% CI, 14.2-36.7) compared to 14 events per hour (95% CI, 3.3-24.6) in conventional therapy group.10 Recent meta-analysis systematic literature review on weight loss published in 2015 which included 19 studies involving surgical weight loss therapy and 20 studies involving non-surgical weight loss therapy (N = 825). In the surgical weight loss therapy group, AHI was reduced by 29 events per hour (95% CI, 22.4- 36.7) compared to 11 events per hour (95%CI, 7.8-15.0) in the non-surgical weight loss therapy group. 11."

Combat GauzeTM and Trauma PadsTM ([QC] Z_Medica QuikClot) are kaolin impregnated hemostatic agents, that in addition to LP, may improve hemorrhage control. While QC packing has been effective in a swine liver injury model, QC remains unstudied for human intra_abdominal use. We hypothesized QC packing during damage control laparotomy (DCL) better controls hemorrhage than standard packing and is safe for intracorporeal use. Methods A retrospective review (2011_2014) at a Level_I Trauma Center reviewed all patients who underwent DCL with intentionally retained packing. Clinical characteristics, intraoperative and postoperative parameters, and outcomes were compared with respect to packing (LP vs. LP + QC). All complications occurring within the patients' hospital stays were reviewed. A p < 0.05 was considered significant. Results 68 patients underwent DCL with packing; (LP n = 40; LP + QC n = 28). No difference in age, BMI, injury mechanism, ISS, or GCS was detected (Table 1, all p > 0.05). LP + QC patients had a lower systolic blood pressure upon ED presentation and greater blood loss during index laparotomy than LP patients. LP + QC patients received more packed red blood cell and fresh frozen plasma resuscitation during index laparotomy (both p < 0.05). Despite greater physiologic derangement in the LP + QC group, there was no difference in total blood products required after index laparotomy until abdominal closure (LP vs LP + QC; p > 0.05). After a median of 2 days until abdominal closure in both groups, no difference in complications rates attributable to intra_abdominal packing (LP vs LP + QC) was detected. Conclusion While the addition of QC to LP packing did not confer additional benefit to standard packing, there was no additional morbidity identified with its use. The surgeons at our institution now select augmented packing with QC for sicker patients, as we believe this may have additional advantage over standard LP packing. A randomized controlled trial is warranted to further evaluate the intra_abdominal use of advanced hemostatic agents, like QC, for both hemostasis and associated morbidity.

A progressively greater number of children and adolescents are being affected by this syndrome due to the constant increase in the prevalence of obesity. Like obesity, childhood MetS highly tracks to adulthood. The pathogenesis of MetS includes the interaction between obesity, insulin resistance, and inflammation. Early diagnosis and intervention are important in order to conduct lifestyle modification.

J. M. Clark	The epidemiology of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in adults	2006			"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver disease that has been shown to progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. This article reviews the prevalence of NAFLD and the factors associated this disorder, and with the more advanced stages of NAFLD, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis. In the general population, the estimated prevalence ranges from 3% to 24%, with most estimates in the 6% to 14% range. NAFLD is extremely common among patients undergoing bariatric surgery, ranging from 84% to 96%. In these patients, 25% to 55% have NASH, 34% to 47% have fibrosis, and 2% to 12% have bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis. NAFLD appears to be most strongly associated with obesity, and insulin resistance states including diabetes and with other features of the metabolic syndrome, such as high triglycerides and low HDL. It appears to be more common in men, and it increases with increasing age and after menopause. Some data suggest that Mexican Americans are more likely to have NAFLD and blacks are less likely compared with non-Hispanic whites. More advanced stages of NAFLD are associated with older age, higher body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, high triglycerides, and/or insulin resistance. An AST/ALT ratio greater >1 may also indicate more severe disease. Although hepatocellular carcinoma can occur in the setting of NAFLD, the risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma in the setting of NAFLD have not been established. More prospective studies are needed to determine the true risk factors for the development and progression of NAFLD to help identify patients at highest risk who might benefit from treatment trials."

A ""multiple-hit"" pathogenetic model has been suggested to explain the progressive liver damage that occurs among children with NAFLD. In addition to the accumulation of fat in the liver, insulin resistance (IR) and oxidative stress due to genetic/epigenetic background, unfavorable lifestyles, gut microbiota and gut-liver axis dysfunction, and perturbations of trace element homeostasis have been shown to be critical for disease progression and the development of more severe inflammatory and fibrotic stages [non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)]. Simple clinical and laboratory parameters, such as age, history, anthropometrical data (BMI and waist circumference percentiles), blood pressure, surrogate clinical markers of IR (acanthosis nigricans), abdominal ultrasounds, and serum transaminases, lipids and glucose/insulin profiles, allow a clinician to identify children with obesity and obesity-related conditions, including NAFLD and cardiovascular and metabolic risks. A liver biopsy (the ""imperfect"" gold standard) is required for a definitive NAFLD/NASH diagnosis, particularly to exclude other treatable conditions or when advanced liver disease is expected on clinical and laboratory grounds and preferably prior to any controlled trial of pharmacological/surgical treatments. However, a biopsy clearly cannot represent a screening procedure. Advancements in diagnostic serum and imaging tools, especially for the non-invasive differentiation between NAFLD and NASH, have shown promising results, e.g., magnetic resonance elastography. Weight loss and physical activity should be the first option of intervention. Effective pharmacological treatments are still under development; however, drugs targeting IR, oxidative stress, proinflammatory pathways, dyslipidemia, gut microbiota and gut liver axis dysfunction are an option for patients who are unable to comply with the recommended lifestyle changes. When morbid obesity prevails, bariatric surgery should be considered."

Thus, it is not clear whether bariatric surgery should be performed on obese patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes or poorly controlled hypertension or hypertriglyceridemia. The mechanism for the immediate improvement in glucose tolerance after gastric bypass is not clear but is being actively investigated., RECENT FINDINGS: Gastric bypass appears to enhance glucagon-like peptide-1 production and suppress glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide production. It appears that patients with type 2 diabetes and a greater BMI gain more benefit from the operation., SUMMARY: Bariatric surgery, particularly gastric bypass, has powerful and usually persistent effects on type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension but randomized controlled trials with predefined metabolic entry criteria and planned comprehensive follow-up are required."

In the elderly, systolic hypertension is a reflection of aging/stiff arteries. Diastolic (+/- systolic) hypertension in young/middle-age is accompanied by increased sympathetic nerve activity, particularly in the presence of the metabolic syndrome or DM2. High beta-receptor density (Bmax) and cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels in human lymphoctes, independent of blood pressure, are associated with a high risk of myocardial infarction (not stroke-risk, which is dependent on blood pressure). This has treatment implications in the young/middle-aged hypertensive subject. Antihypertensive agents that increase sympathetic nerve activity e.g. dihydropyridine calcium blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, and thiazide-type diuretics, do not reduce (and may increase) the risk of myocardial infarction. Beta-1 blockade, effective in reversing and stabilising coronary atheromataous plaque, and with possible anti-tumor properties, is superior to ACE-inhibition, and is the treatment of choice in young/middle-aged hypertension with DM2. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."

Clinical trial demonstrates exercise following bariatric surgery improves insulin sensitivity	2015	10.1172/JCI78016	CN-01039960	"BACKGROUND: Roux_en_Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery causes profound weight loss and improves insulin sensitivity (S(I)) in obese patients. Regular exercise can also improve S(I) in obese individuals; however, it is unknown whether exercise and RYGB surgery_induced weight loss would additively improve S(I) and other cardiometabolic factors. METHODS: We conducted a single_blind, prospective, randomized trial with 128 men and women who recently underwent RYGB surgery (within 1_3 months). Participants were randomized to either a 6_month semi_supervised moderate exercise protocol (EX, n = 66) or a health education control (CON; n = 62) intervention. Main outcomes measured included S(I) and glucose effectiveness (S(G)), which were determined from an intravenous glucose tolerance test and minimal modeling. Secondary outcomes measured were cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2 peak) and body composition. Data were analyzed using an intention_to_treat (ITT) and per_protocol (PP) approach to assess the efficacy of the exercise intervention (>120 min of exercise/week). RESULTS: 119 (93%) participants completed the interventions, 95% for CON and 91% for EX. There was a significant decrease in body weight and fat mass for both groups (P < 0.001 for time effect). S(I) improved in both groups following the intervention (ITT: CON vs. EX; +1.64 vs. +2.24 min__/_U/ml, P = 0.18 for _, P < 0.001 for time effect). A PP analysis revealed that exercise produced an additive S(I) improvement (PP: CON vs. EX; +1.57 vs. +2.69 min__/_U/ml, P = 0.019) above that of surgery. Exercise also improved S(G) (ITT: CON vs. EX; +0.0023 vs. +0.0063 min__, P = 0.009) compared with the CON group. Exercise improved cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2 peak) compared with the CON group. CONCLUSION: Moderate exercise following RYGB surgery provides additional improvements in S(I), S(G), and cardiorespiratory fitness compared with a sedentary lifestyle during similar weight loss.

Recent publications have shown the good results of metabolic surgery, creating a new field of clinical research that is currently overflowing in the medical community with outstanding high-quality data. In morbidly obese population, there is compelling data on long term cardiovascular risk reduction and mortality, coming from longitudinal prospective studies and systematic reviews. Numbers range from 33 to 92% of decrease in fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events . In low body mass index (BMI) diabetics, there is an increasing number of reported good outcomes after metabolic surgery with the aim to treat type 2 diabetes (T2DM). There is scarce information on cardiovascular outcomes in non-morbidly obese subjects, but the extraordinary glucose, lipid and blood pressure control in the published series are suggesting good long-term effects on cardiovascular risk profile and mortality.

Methods: A 5 year, open_label, single_centre, randomised trial studied patients with diabetic kidney disease and class I obesity after 1:1 randomization to best medical treatment (n = 49) or RYGB (n = 51). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving remission of microalbuminuria after 5 years. Secondary outcomes included improvements in diabetic kidney disease, glycemic control, quality of life, and safety. For efficacy outcomes, we performed an intention_to_treat (ITT) analysis. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01821508. Findings: 88% of patients (44 per arm) completed 5_year follow_up. Remission of albuminuria occurred in 59.6% (95% CI = 45.5Ð73.8) after best medical treatment and 69.7% (95% CI = 59.6Ð79.8) after RYGB (risk difference: 10%, 95% CI, _7 to 27, P = 0.25). Patients after RYGB were twice as likely to achieve an HbA1c ² 6.5% (60.2% versus 25.4%, risk difference, 34.9%; 95% CI = 15.8Ð53.9, P < 0.001). Quality of life after five years measured by the 36_Item Short Form Survey questionnaire (standardized to a 0_to_100 scale) was higher in the RYGB group than in the best medical treatment group for several domains. The mean differences were 13.5 (95% CI, 5.5Ð21.6, P = 0.001) for general health, 19.7 (95% CI, 9.1Ð30.3, P < 0.001) for pain, 6.1 (95% CI, _4.8 to 17.0, P = 0.27) for social functioning, 8.3 (95% CI, 0.23 to 16.3, P = 0.04) for emotional well_being, 12.2 (95% CI, 3.9Ð20.4, P = 0.004) for vitality, 16.8 (95% CI, _0.75 to 34.4, P = 0.06) for mental health, 21.8 (95% CI, 4.8Ð38.7, P = 0.01) for physical health and 11.1 (95% CI, 2.24Ð19.9, P = 0.01) for physical functioning. Serious adverse events were experienced in 7/46 (15.2%) after best medical treatment and 11/46 patients (24%) after RYGB (P = 0.80).

Edmonton obesity staging system (EOSS) is a new tool for classification of obesity that considers the metabolic, physical, and psychological health. The cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the periodontal status of morbidly obese patients eligible for bariatric surgery and the association between periodontitis, obesity-related comorbidities, and EOSS., METHODS: Morbidly obese patients eligible for bariatric surgery underwent detailed periodontal examination and were divided into the periodontitis group (PG) and the non-periodontitis group (NPG). The medical and demographic data were obtained from medical files, while behavioural data were obtained by the interview. Descriptive statistics and simple statistical tests were used to summarise the characteristics of the sample and the differences between PG and NPG. The logistic regression models were used to calculate the association (odds ratio (OR)) between periodontitis and obesity-related diseases and EOSS., RESULTS: The study included 79 patients, with an average BMI of 44.6 kg/m2 (SD = 7.2). The prevalence of periodontitis was 65% (CI 95% 53%-75%). PG patients (n = 51) were older, more often smokers and were more often hypertensive than NPG patients (n = 28) (p < 0.05). Hypertension was positively associated with periodontitis with adjusted OR 3.98 (95% CI 1.23-12.8; p = 0.021)) and age with adjusted OR 1.06, (95% CI 1.01-1.13; p = 0.038)), while other tested conditions (diabetes, dyslipidaemia, and smoking habits) did not show significant association with periodontitis. Periodontitis did not correlate with EOSS or other obesity-related comorbidities (p > 0.05)., CONCLUSION: The morbidly obese patients eligible for bariatric surgery show a high prevalence of periodontitis and, therefore, are advised to be examined by a dentist before undergoing surgery. They have higher odds of hypertension but not of other obesity-related diseases or higher stages of EOSS. The medical personnel should raise awareness among obese patients on the potential association of poor periodontal health with hypertension., TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04653714. Copyright © 2022.

The effects of the available bariatric procedures compared with medical management and with each other are uncertain. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003 and most recently updated in 2009., OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of bariatric surgery for overweight and obesity, including the control of comorbidities., SEARCH METHODS: Studies were obtained from searches of numerous databases, supplemented with searches of reference lists and consultation with experts in obesity research. Date of last search was November 2013., SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing surgical interventions with non-surgical management of obesity or overweight or comparing different surgical procedures., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted by one review author and checked by a second review author. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and evaluated overall study quality utilising the GRADE instrument., MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-two trials with 1798 participants were included; sample sizes ranged from 15 to 250. Most studies followed participants for 12, 24 or 36 months; the longest follow-up was 10 years. The risk of bias across all domains of most trials was uncertain; just one was judged to have adequate allocation concealment.All seven RCTs comparing surgery with non-surgical interventions found benefits of surgery on measures of weight change at one to two years follow-up. Improvements for some aspects of health-related quality of life (QoL) (two RCTs) and diabetes (five RCTs) were also found. The overall quality of the evidence was moderate. Five studies reported data on mortality, no deaths occurred. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in four studies and ranged from 0% to 37% in the surgery groups and 0% to 25% in the no surgery groups. Between 2% and 13% of participants required reoperations in the five studies that reported these data.Three RCTs found that laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (L)(RYGB) achieved significantly greater weight loss and body mass index (BMI) reduction up to five years after surgery compared with laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). Mean end-of-study BMI was lower following LRYGB compared with LAGB: mean difference (MD) -5.2 kg/m2 (95% confidence interval (CI) -6.4 to -4.0; P < 0.00001; 265 participants; 3 trials; moderate quality evidence). Evidence for QoL and comorbidities was very low quality. The LRGYB procedure resulted in greater duration of hospitalisation in two RCTs (4/3.1 versus 2/1.5 days) and a greater number of late major complications (26.1% versus 11.6%) in one RCT. In one RCT the LAGB required high rates of reoperation for band removal (9 patients, 40.9%). Open RYGB, LRYGB and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) led to losses of weight and/or BMI but there was no consistent picture as to which procedure was better or worse in the seven included trials. MD was -0.2 kg/m2 (95% CI -1.8 to 1.3); 353 participants; 6 trials; low quality evidence) in favour of LRYGB. No statistically significant differences in QoL were found (one RCT). Six RCTs reported mortality; one death occurred following LRYGB. SAEs were reported by one RCT and were higher in the LRYGB group (4.5%) than the LSG group (0.9%). Reoperations ranged from 6.7% to 24% in the LRYGB group and 3.3% to 34% in the LSG group. Effects on comorbidities, complications and additional surgical procedures were neutral, except gastro-oesophageal reflux disease improved following LRYGB (one RCT). One RCT of people with a BMI 25 to 35 and type 2 diabetes found laparoscopic mini-gastric bypass resulted in greater weight loss and improvement of diabetes compared with LSG, and had similar levels of complications.Two RCTs found that biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BDDS) resulted in greater weight loss than RYGB in morbidly obese patients. End-of-study mean BMI loss was greater following BDDS: MD -7.3 kg/m2 (95% CI -9.3 to -5.4); < 0.00001; 107 participants; 2 trials; moderate quality evidence). QoL was similar on most domains. In one study between 82% to 100% of participants with diabetes had a HbA1c of less than 5% three years after surgery. Reoperations were higher in the BDDS group (16.1% to 27.6%) than the LRYGB group (4.3% to 8.3%). One death occurred in the BDDS group.One RCT comparing laparoscopic duodenojejunal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy versus LRYGB found BMI, excess weight loss, and rates of remission of diabetes and hypertension were similar at 12 months follow-up (very low quality evidence). QoL, SAEs and reoperation rates were not reported. No deaths occurred in either group.One RCT comparing laparoscopic isolated sleeve gastrectomy (LISG) versus LAGB found greater improvement in weight-loss outcomes following LISG at three years follow-up (very low quality evidence). QoL, mortality and SAEs were not reported. Reoperations occurred in 20% of the LAGB group and in 10% of the LISG group.One RCT (unpublished) comparing laparoscopic gastric imbrication with LSG found no statistically significant difference in weight loss between groups (very low quality evidence). QoL and comorbidities were not reported. No deaths occurred. Two participants in the gastric imbrication group required reoperation., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Surgery results in greater improvement in weight loss outcomes and weight associated comorbidities compared with non-surgical interventions, regardless of the type of procedures used. When compared with each other, certain procedures resulted in greater weight loss and improvements in comorbidities than others. Outcomes were similar between RYGB and sleeve gastrectomy, and both of these procedures had better outcomes than adjustable gastric banding. For people with very high BMI, biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch resulted in greater weight loss than RYGB. Duodenojejunal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic RYGB had similar outcomes, however this is based on one small trial. Isolated sleeve gastrectomy led to better weight-loss outcomes than adjustable gastric banding after three years follow-up. This was based on one trial only. Weight-related outcomes were similar between laparoscopic gastric imbrication and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in one trial. Across all studies adverse event rates and reoperation rates were generally poorly reported. Most trials followed participants for only one or two years, therefore the long-term effects of surgery remain unclear."

Clegg"	Surgery for obesity	2009	https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003641.pub3		"BACKGROUND: Bariatric (weight loss) surgery for obesity is considered when other treatments have failed. The effects of the available bariatric procedures compared with medical management and with each other are uncertain. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003 and previously updated in 2005., OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of bariatric surgery for obesity., SEARCH STRATEGY: Studies were obtained from computerized searches of multiple electronic bibliographic databases, supplemented with searches of reference lists and consultation with experts in obesity research., SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different surgical procedures, and RCTs, controlled clinical trials and prospective cohort studies comparing surgery with non-surgical management for obesity., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked independently by two reviewers. Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality., MAIN RESULTS: Twenty six studies were included. Three RCTs and three prospective cohort studies compared surgery with non-surgical management, and 20 RCTs compared different bariatric procedures. The risk of bias of many trials was uncertain; just five had adequate allocation concealment. A meta-analysis was not appropriate.Surgery results in greater weight loss than conventional treatment in moderate (body mass index greater than 30) as well as severe obesity. Reductions in comorbidities, such as diabetes and hypertension, also occur. Improvements in health-related quality of life occurred after two years, but effects at ten years are less clear.Surgery is associated with complications, such as pulmonary embolism, and some postoperative deaths occurred.Five different bariatric procedures were assessed, but some comparisons were assessed by just one trial. The limited evidence suggests that weight loss following gastric bypass is greater than vertical banded gastroplasty or adjustable gastric banding, but similar to isolated sleeve gastrectomy and banded gastric bypass. Isolated sleeve gastrectomy appears to result in greater weight loss than adjustable gastric banding. Evidence comparing vertical banded gastroplasty with adjustable gastric banding is inconclusive. Data on the comparative safety of the bariatric procedures was limited. Weight loss and quality of life were similar between open and laparoscopic surgery. Conversion from laparoscopic to open surgery may occur., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Surgery is more effective than conventional management. Certain procedures produce greater weight loss, but data are limited. The evidence on safety is even less clear. Due to limited evidence and poor quality of the trials, caution is required when interpreting comparative safety and effectiveness."

Effect of Electronic Health Record-Based Coaching on Weight Maintenance: a Randomized Trial	2019	10.7326/M18-3337	CN-02005971	"BACKGROUND: Weight regain after intentional loss is common. Most evidence_based weight management programs focus on short_term loss rather than long_term maintenance. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the benefit of coaching in an electronic health record (EHR)_based weight maintenance intervention. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01946191). SETTING: Practices affiliated with an academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Adult outpatients with body mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m2 or higher, intentional weight loss of at least 5% in the previous 2 years, and no bariatric procedures in the previous 5 years. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to EHR tools (tracking group) versus EHR tools plus coaching (coaching group). The EHR tools included weight, diet, and physical activity tracking flow sheets; standardized surveys; and reminders. The coaching group received 24 months of personalized coaching through the EHR patient portal, with 24 scheduled contacts. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was weight change at 24 months. Secondary outcomes included 5% weight loss maintenance and changes in BMI, waist circumference, number of steps per day, health_related quality of life, physical function, blood pressure, and satisfaction. RESULTS: Among 194 randomly assigned participants (mean age, 53.4 years [SD, 12.2]; 143 [74%] women; 171 [88%] white), 157 (81%) completed the trial. Mean baseline weight and BMI were 85.8 kg (SD, 19.1) and 30.4 kg/m2 (SD, 5.9). At 24 months, mean weight regain (± SE) was 2.1 ± 0.62 kg and 4.9 ± 0.63 kg in the coaching and tracking groups, respectively. The between_group difference in weight change at 24 months was significant (_2.86 kg [95% CI, _4.60 to _1.11 kg]) in the linear mixed model. At 24 months, 65% of participants in the coaching group and 50% in the tracking group maintained weight loss of at least 5%. LIMITATION: Single_site trial, which limits generalizability. CONCLUSION: Among adults with intentional weight loss of at least 5%, use of EHR tools plus coaching resulted in less weight regain than EHR tools alone.

There is a lack of studies on the evolution of bone health of elderly people who underwent bariatric surgery, in general, and when comparing the gastric bypass (GB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) techniques. OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate the bone health of elderly patients with obesity undergoing bariatric surgery. METHOD(S): This is a prospective randomized clinical study, that was carried out with individuals of both sexes, >=65 years, undergoing GB or SG and who met the inclusion criteria. Age, gender and comorbidities (type 2 diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia and osteoarthrosis) were collected and analyzed at baseline. Anthropometric data (weight, body mass index, percentage of weight loss, percentage of excess weight loss), laboratory tests related to bone health and bone mineral density were analyzed before and 24 months after surgery. RESULT(S): A total of 36 patients (GB, n=18; SG, n=18) were evaluated. At baseline, except for sex and preoperative body mass index, which was higher in GB, groups were similar. After 24 months, GB was superior for weight loss (%WL) and excess weight loss (%EWL). Regarding bone health, a significant decrease of BMD was observed in the spine, total proximal femur and femoral neck in all groups, with an average decrease of 5.1%, 10.5% and 15.1%, respectively. In addition, the observed decrease in BMD was up to 25% in the total femur after 24 months, six patients went from normal BMD to osteopenia and one from osteopenia to osteoporosis. There was no difference in parathormone values. However, there was an association between the increase in parathormone and the decrease in BMD in the spine, mainly in the GB group. There was no association between %WL and %EWL with the reduction in BMD. CONCLUSION(S): Bariatric surgery was related to the reduction of BMD in elderly patients, but there was no statistical difference between the two surgical techniques."

Aim of the study was to compare different types of BS with medical therapy (MT) for the treatment of obesity., DATA SYNTHESIS: We conducted a network-meta-analysis (NMA) including randomized clinical trials comparing different BS techniques versus MT in people with obesity, with a duration >=24 weeks (PROSPERO, #CRD42020160359). Primary endpoint was BMI. Indirect comparisons of different types of surgery were performed by NMA. Types of BS included: laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy (SG), bilio-pancreatic diversion (BPD); greater curvature plication (GCP); one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB); Laparoscopic Vertical Banded Gastroplasty (LVBG) and duodenal switch (DS). 43 trials were retrieved in this metanalysis. BS was associated with a significant reduction in BMI, systolic blood pressure, triglyceride and fasting glucose, and with a significant increase of HDL cholesterol when compared to MT. In direct comparisons, RYGB was more effective than LAGB, LVBG, and GCP, but less effective than DS, whereas LAGB was less effective than LVBG and SG. In the NMA, DS and BPD appeared to be more effective than other procedures., CONCLUSIONS: BS produces a greater weight loss than MT in morbidly obese patients, inducing a greater improvement of obesity-associated metabolic parameters. Available data are insufficient to assess the effect of BS on mortality. Different surgical procedures are heterogeneous for efficacy and safety.

Bariatric surgery induces weight loss and short-term health improvements, but little is known about long-term outcomes of these operations., OBJECTIVE: To report 3-year change in weight and select health parameters after common bariatric surgical procedures., DESIGN AND SETTING: The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS) Consortium is a multicenter observational cohort study at 10 US hospitals in 6 geographically diverse clinical centers. PARTICIPANTS AND EXPOSURE: Adults undergoing first-time bariatric surgical procedures as part of routine clinical care by participating surgeons were recruited between 2006 and 2009 and followed up until September 2012. Participants completed research assessments prior to surgery and 6 months, 12 months, and then annually after surgery., MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Three years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), we assessed percent weight change from baseline and the percentage of participants with diabetes achieving hemoglobin A1c levels less than 6.5% or fasting plasma glucose values less than 126 mg/dL without pharmacologic therapy. Dyslipidemia and hypertension resolution at 3 years was also assessed., RESULTS: At baseline, participants (N = 2458) were 18 to 78 years old, 79% were women, median BMI was 45.9 (IQR, 41.7-51.5), and median weight was 129 kg (IQR, 115-147). For their first bariatric surgical procedure, 1738 participants underwent RYGB, 610 LAGB, and 110 other procedures. At baseline, 774 (33%) had diabetes, 1252 (63%) dyslipidemia, and 1601 (68%) hypertension. Three years after surgery, median actual weight loss for RYGB participants was 41 kg (IQR, 31-52), corresponding to a percentage of baseline weight lost of 31.5% (IQR, 24.6%-38.4%). For LAGB participants, actual weight loss was 20 kg (IQR, 10-29), corresponding to 15.9% (IQR, 7.9%-23.0%). The majority of weight loss was evident 1 year after surgery for both procedures. Five distinct weight change trajectory groups were identified for each procedure. Among participants who had diabetes at baseline, 216 RYGB participants (67.5%) and 28 LAGB participants (28.6%) experienced partial remission at 3 years. The incidence of diabetes was 0.9% after RYGB and 3.2% after LAGB. Dyslipidemia resolved in 237 RYGB participants (61.9%) and 39 LAGB participants (27.1%); remission of hypertension occurred in 269 RYGB participants (38.2%) and 43 LAGB participants (17.4%)., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among participants with severe obesity, there was substantial weight loss 3 years after bariatric surgery, with the majority experiencing maximum weight change during the first year.

OBJECTIVE To examine long-term weight change and health status following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS) study is a multicenter observational cohort study at 10 US hospitals in 6 geographically diverse clinical centers. Adults undergoing bariatric surgical procedures as part of clinical care between 2006 and 2009 were recruited and followed up until January 31, 2015. Participants completed presurgery, 6-month, and annual research assessments for up to 7 years. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES Percentage ofweight change from baseline, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, determined by physical measures, laboratory testing, and medication use. RESULTS Of 2348 participants, 1738 underwent RYGB (74%) and 610 underwent LAGB (26%). For RYBG, the median age was 45 years (range, 19-75 years), the median body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 47 (range, 34-81), 1389 participants (80%) were women, and 257 participants (15%) were nonwhite. For LAGB, the median age was 48 years (range, 18-78), the body mass index was 44 (range, 33-87), 465 participants (76%) were women, and 63 participants (10%) were nonwhite. Follow-up weights were obtained in 1300 of 1569 (83%) eligible for a year-7 visit. Seven years following RYGB, mean weight loss was 38.2 kg (95%CI, 36.9-39.5), or 28.4%(95%CI, 27.6-29.2) of baseline weight; between years 3 and 7 mean weight regain was 3.9%(95%CI, 3.4-4.4) of baseline weight. Seven years after LAGB, mean weight loss was 18.8 kg (95%CI, 16.3-21.3) or 14.9%(95%CI, 13.1-16.7), with 1.4%(95%CI, 0.4-2.4) regain. Six distinct weight change trajectory patterns for RYGB and 7 for LAGB were identified. Most participants followed trajectories in which weight regain from 3 to 7 years was small relative to year-3 weight loss, but patterns were variable. Compared with baseline, dyslipidemia prevalence was lower 7 years following both procedures; diabetes and hypertension prevalence were lower following RYGB only. Among those with diabetes at baseline (488 of 1723 with RYGB [28%]; 175 of 604 with LAGB [29%]), the proportion in remission at 1, 3, 5, and 7 years were 71.2%(95%CI, 67.0-75.4), 69.4%(95%CI, 65.0-73.8), 64.6%(95%CI, 60.0-69.2), and 60.2%(95%CI, 54.7-65.6), respectively, for RYGB and 30.7%(95%CI, 22.8-38.7), 29.3% (95%CI, 21.6-37.1), 29.2%(95%CI, 21.0-37.4), and 20.3%(95%CI, 9.7-30.9) for LAGB. The incidence of diabetes at all follow-up assessments was less than 1.5%for RYGB. Bariatric reoperations occurred in 14 RYGB and 160 LAGB participants. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Following bariatric surgery, differentweight loss patterns were observed, but most participants maintained much of their weight loss with variable fluctuations over the long term.

Cowie	Sleep apnea: State of the art	2017	https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcm.2016.12.005		"Many patient with, or at risk of, cardiovascular disease have sleep disordered breathing (SDB), which can be either obstructive (with intermittent collapse of the upper airway) or central (episodic loss of respiratory drive). SDB is associated with sleep disturbance, hypoxemia, hemodynamic changes, and sympathetic activation. Such patients have a worse prognosis than those without SDB. Mask-based therapies of positive airway pressure targeted at SDB can improve measures of sleep quality and partially normalize the sleep and respiratory physiology, but recent randomized trials of cardiovascular outcomes in SDB have either been neutral (obstructive sleep apnea) or suggested the possibility of harm, likely from increased sudden death, in central sleep apnea. Alternative methods for the treatment of SDB are being explored, including implantable technologies, but these have not been studied in adequately powered randomized controlled studies. International guidelines recommend screening for SDB, which can be done easily in clinical practice, as there may be a role for the treatment of patients with obstructive sleep apnea and daytime sleepiness, or resistant hypertension, or atrial fibrillation. Further randomised outcome studies are required to determine whether mask-based treatment for SDB is appropriate for patients with chronic systolic heart failure and obstructive sleep apnea; for those with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; and for those with decompensated heart failure. The case is made that no longer can the surrogate endpoints of improvement in respiratory and sleep metrics be taken as adequate therapeutic outcome measures in patients with sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc."

Beyond weight reduction, dietary supplements like micronutrients or probiotics that modify insulin resistance and lipotoxicity can be used to prevent or delay the progression of liver disease. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the effect of a dietary approach with a specifically tailored multistrain probiotic and micronutrient mixture compared with a basic care micronutrient supplement on serum alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) in obese patients after mini gastric bypass (MGB) surgery. METHODS: This randomized, double_blind, controlled trial included 60 obese patients (age: 40 ± 10 y; BMI: 44 ± 3 kg/m_). Patients received a combination of specifically tailored multistrain probiotic powder and a specific micronutrient mixture (Pro+SM) or a control treatment consisting of a placebo and a basic care micronutrient mixture (Con+BM), with some micronutrients in lower doses than SM, for 12 wk after hospital discharge. Primary (serum ALAT) and secondary outcomes [serum aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), fatty liver index, NAFLD fibrosis score, glucose metabolism, blood pressure (BP), heart rate] were assessed at week 0 and week 12. Data were analyzed using unpaired Student's t_tests or Mann_Whitney U tests to compare the changes due to each treatment to one another. RESULTS: A total of 48 patients were included in the analyses. Changes in serum ALAT concentrations did not differ between groups. Compared with Con+BM, Pro+SM improved serum ASAT (difference: _8.0 U/L, 95% CI: _17.0, _4.0; P = 0.043), NAFLD fibrosis score (difference: _0.39; 95% CI: _0.78, 0; P = 0.048), serum triglycerides (difference: _22.8 mg/dL; 95% CI: _45.6, _0.1; P = 0.049) and the visceral adiposity index (difference: _0.70; 95% CI: _1.31, _0.08; P = 0.027). CONCLUSION: Supplementation with a specifically tailored probiotic and micronutrient mixture improved NAFLD_related markers more than a basic micronutrient mixture in obese patients following MGB surgery.

We sought to describe changes in anthropometric and metabolic characteristics in a cohort of bariatric patients after participation in a nurse-led, structured lifestyle programme. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study of adults with a body mass index (BMI) >=40 kgm-2 (or >=35 kgm-2 with significant co-morbidity) who were attending a regional bariatric service and who completed a single centre, 8-week, nurse-led multidisciplinary lifestyle modification programme. Weight, height, waist circumference, blood pressure, HbA1c, fasting glucose and lipid profiles as well as functional capacity (Incremental Shuttle Walk Test) and questionnaire-based anxiety and depression scores before and after the programme were compared in per-protocol analyses. Result(s): Of 183 bariatric patients enrolled, 150 (81.9 %) completed the programme. Mean age of completers was 47.9 +/- 11.2 years. 34.7 % were male. There were statistically significant reductions in weight (129.6 +/- 25.9 v 126.9 +/- 26.1 kg, p < 0.001), BMI (46.3 +/- 8.3 v 44.9 +/- 9.0 kgm-2, p < 0.001), waist circumference (133.0 +/- 17.1 v 129.3 +/- 17.5 cm in women and 143.8 +/- 19.0 v 135.1 +/- 17.9 cm in men, both p < 0.001) as well as anxiety and depression scores, total- and LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels, with an increase in functional capacity (5.9 +/- 1.7 v 6.8 +/- 2.1 metabolic equivalents of thermogenesis (METS), p < 0.001) in completers at the end of the programme compared to the start. Blood pressure improved, with reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure from 135 +/- 16.2 to 131.6 +/- 17.1 (p = 0.009) and 84.7 +/- 10.2 to 81.4 +/- 10.9 mmHg (p < 0.001), respectively. The proportion of patients achieving target blood pressure increased from 50.3 to 59.3 % (p = 0.04). The proportion of patients with diabetes achieving HbA1c <53 mmol/mol increased from 28.6 to 42.9 %, p = 0.02. Conclusion(s): Bariatric patients completing an 8 week, nurse-led structured lifestyle programme had improved adiposity, fitness, lipid profiles, psychosocial health, blood pressure and glycaemia. Further assessment of this programme in a pragmatic randomised controlled trial seems warranted.Copyright © 2015 Crowe et al."

Therefore, we wanted to evaluate the influence of resecting or leaving in situ the greater omentum in a group of patients with morbid obesity. Method(s): Seventy patients with morbid obesity were submitted to laparotomic resectional gastric bypass and an omentectomy was randomly performed in some patients. Body mass index (BMI), serum levels of sugar, insulin, total cholesterol, and triglycerides were determined prior to surgery and followed up on for 2 years afterwards. Result(s): Two years after surgery, no differences were seen in BMI levels in either group. Blood sugar levels, serum insulin, total cholesterol levels, and serum triglycerides had similar values in both groups. Arterial hypertension had similar behavior. Conclusion(s): Based on these results, omentectomy is not justified as part of bariatric surgery. Its theoretical advantages are not reflected in this prospective random trial. © 2008 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC."

Gastric bypass surgery vs intensive lifestyle and medical intervention for type 2 diabetes: the CROSSROADS randomised controlled trial	2016	10.1007/s00125-016-3903-x	CN-01158554	"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Mounting evidence indicates that Roux_en_Y gastric bypass (RYGB) ameliorates type 2 diabetes, but randomised trials comparing surgical vs nonsurgical care are needed. With a parallel_group randomised controlled trial (RCT), we compared RYGB vs an intensive lifestyle and medical intervention (ILMI) for type 2 diabetes, including among patients with a BMI <35 kg/m(2). METHODS: By use of a shared decision_making recruitment strategy targeting the entire at_risk population within an integrated community healthcare system, we screened 1,808 adults meeting inclusion criteria (age 25_64, with type 2 diabetes and a BMI 30_45 kg/m(2)). Of these, 43 were allocated via concealed, computer_generated random assignment in a 1:1 ratio to RYGB or ILMI. The latter involved ³45 min of aerobic exercise 5 days per week, a dietitian_directed weight_ and glucose_lowering diet, and optimal diabetes medical treatment for 1 year. Although treatment allocation could not be blinded, outcomes were determined by a blinded adjudicator. The primary outcome was diabetes remission at 1 year (HbA1c <6.0% [<42.1 mmol/mol], off all diabetes medicines). RESULTS: Twenty_three volunteers were assigned to RYGB and 20 to ILMI. Of these, 11 withdrew before receiving any intervention. Hence 15 in the RYGB group and 17 in the IMLI group were analysed throughout 1 year. The groups were equivalent regarding all baseline characteristics, except that the RYGB cohort had a longer diabetes duration (11.4_±_4.8 vs 6.8_±_5.2 years, p_=_0.009). Weight loss at 1 year was 25.8_±_14.5% vs 6.4_±_5.8% after RYGB vs ILMI, respectively (p_<_0.001). The ILMI exercise programme yielded a 22_±_11% increase in [Formula: see text] (p<0.0001), whereas [Formula: see text] after RYGB was unchanged. Diabetes remission at 1 year was 60.0% with RYGB vs 5.9% with ILMI (p_=_0.002). The HbA1c decline over 1 year was only modestly more after RYGB than ILMI: from 7.7_±_1.0% (60.7 mmol/mol) to 6.4_±_1.6% (46.4 mmol/mol) vs 7.3_±_0.9% (56.3 mmol/mol) to 6.9_±_1.3% (51.9 mmol/mol), respectively (p_=_0.04); however, this drop occurred with significantly fewer or no diabetes medications after RYGB. No life_threatening complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Compared with the most rigorous ILMI yet tested against surgery in a randomised trial, RYGB yielded greater type 2 diabetes remission in mild_to_moderately obese patients recruited from a well_informed, population_based sample.

To improve the long-term renal and cardiovascular outcome, there is the incorporation of bariatric surgery (BS), which seems to be a pivotal intervention. Areas Explored: Cohort studies and randomized controlled trial (RCT) research of BS among patients with T2DM, were conducted by screening, and then information on renal effects and the cardiovascular outcome was gathered. Metabolic surgery (MS) and BS reduce both mortality and the risk of cardiovascular disorder, chronic kidney diseases and albuminuria. MS refers to a surgical approach, the primary intent of which is the control of metabolic alterations/hyperglycemia in contrast to BS which is a mere weight-reduction therapy. Patients suffering from poor glycaemic control and other macro and micro-vascular diseases will benefit from a surgical approach. The approach implicates hypertension glomerular remission, gut microbiota shift, reduced renal inflammation and fewer instances of chronic cardiac remodelling., CONCLUSION: MS is beneficial where the main aim is to attain significant and long-lasting weight loss results. The RCTs have depicted the superiority which surgical mechanisms hold over medically- based therapy, for enhancing glycaemic control, and achieving remission of diabetes. This type of surgery improves life quality, reduces incidences of other obesity and diabetes related diseases like microvascular disases, sleep apnea, fatal disorder, and fatty liver disease.

This research aimed to compare the effects of Passiflora incarnata and midazolam for the control of anxiety in patients undergoing mandibular third molar extraction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty volunteers underwent bilateral extraction of their mandibular third molars in a randomized, controlled, double_blind, crossover clinical trial. Passiflora incarnata (260 mg) or midazolam (15 mg) were orally administered 30 minutes before surgery. The anxiety level of participants was evaluated by questionnaires and measurement of physical parameters, including heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and oxygen saturation (SpO2). RESULTS: Considering each procedure independently, there were no significant differences between the protocols in BP, HR, and SpO2. Over 70% of the volunteers responded that they felt quiet or a little anxious under both protocols. With midazolam, 20% of the participants reported amnesia (not remembering anything at all), while Passiflora showed little or no ability to interfere with memory formation. CONCLUSIONS: Passiflora incarnata showed an anxiolytic effect similar to midazolam, and was safe and effective for conscious sedation in adult patients who underwent extraction of their mandibular third molars."

However, the effect of bariatric surgery upon diabetic retinopathy is still a subject of debate as some studies show a positive effect while others raise concerns about potential early worsening effects. We performed a systematic review, on PubMed, Science Direct, and Web of Science databases regarding the onset and progression of diabetic retinopathy in obese T2DM patients who underwent weight-loss surgical procedures. A total of 6375 T2DM patients were analyzed. Most cases remained stable after bariatric surgery (89.6%). New onset of diabetic retinopathy (DR) was documented in 290 out of 5972 patients (4.8%). In cases with DR at baseline, progression was documented in 50 out of 403 (12.4%) and regression in 90 (22.3%). Preoperative careful preparation of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), blood pressure, and lipidemia should be provided to minimize the expectation of DR worsening. Ophthalmologic follow-up should be continued regularly in the postoperative period even in the case of diabetic remission. Further randomized trials are needed to better understand the organ-specific risk factors for progression and provide personalized counseling for T2DM patients planned for bariatric surgery."

Davis	Contemporary strategies for managing cardiometabolic risk factors	2006			"OBJECTIVE: To review the metabolic syndrome as defined by the 2001 Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (ATP III) and its modifiable risk factors and to review currently available treatment modalities., SUMMARY: Metabolic syndrome, although still controversial, is a growing concern. Most definitions include elevated blood pressure, smoking, inflammation, insulin resistance, abdominal adiposity, elevated blood glucose, and atherogenic dyslipidemia as modifiable risk factors. Some researchers believe that additional signs of inflammation such as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and C-reactive protein should be added to this list. Current treatment options include lifestyle changes (diet and exercise), pharmacotherapy, and bariatric surgery. The endocannabinoid system appears to play a key role in metabolism and weight gain. The investigational agent rimonabant is a cannabinoid receptor type 1 blocker that has been employed in numerous trials involving more than 6,500 patients. It has led to significant weight loss, reduced central fat, and improved glycemic and lipid profiles."
C. P. Day	Clinical spectrum and therapy of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis	2012	https://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000341128		"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is increasingly being diagnosed worldwide and considered to be the commonest liver disorder in Western countries. It comprises a disease spectrum ranging from simple steatosis (fatty liver) through non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to fat with fibrosis and, ultimately, cirrhosis. Simple steatosis is largely benign and non-progressive, whereas NASH can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Therapeutic strategies can be divided into those directed at components of the metabolic syndrome with potential beneficial liver effects and those directed specifically at the liver. Recent data suggest that diet and exercise improve NASH, particular in those achieving >7% weight loss. Obesity surgery has been shown to improve steatosis in all studies and inflammation and fibrosis in some. With respect to anti-diabetic drugs, results for metformin have not been convincing and concerns over the safety of glitazones have reduced the initial enthusiasm for their use. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers hold the most promise as anti-hypertensive agents for patients with NASH and hypertension. With respect to more specific liver-directed therapies, there have been promising studies of antioxidants, including betaine and probucol, and vitamin E may improve NASH in adults and children. The TNF-alpha-lowering agent pentoxifylline may have beneficial effects on NASH. Liver transplantation is successful, but the disease recurrence rate is high in the absence of treatment of the underlying metabolic syndrome. Copyright © 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel."

We investigated the effects of volume_controlled (VCV) and pressure_controlled ventilation (PCV) on gas exchange, respiratory mechanics, and cardiovascular responses in laparoscopic gastric banding procedures. METHODS: After Institutional Review Board approval, 24 adult consenting patients scheduled for laparoscopic gastric banding were studied. Anesthesia was standardized using remifentanil, propofol, rocuronium, and sevoflurane. All patients started with VCV with a tidal volume of 10 ml kg(_1) ideal body weight, respiratory rate adjusted to obtain an end_tidal carbon dioxide of 35_40 mmHg, positive end_expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, an inspiratory pause of 10% and an inspiratory/expiratory ratio of 1:2. Fifteen minutes after pneumoperitoneum, the patients were randomly allocated to two groups. In Group VCV (n = 12), ventilation was with the same parameters. In Group PCV (n = 12), the airway pressure was set to provide a tidal volume of 10 ml kg(_1) ideal body weight without exceeding 35 cm H2O. Respiratory rate was adjusted to keep an end_tidal carbon dioxide of 35_40 mmHg. Arterial blood samples were drawn after surgical positioning and 15 min after allocation. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: With constant minute ventilation, VCV generates equal airway pressures and cardiovascular effects with a lower PaCO2 as compared to PCV (42.5 (5.2) mmHg versus 48.9 (4.3) mmHg, p < 0.01 ANOVA). Arterial oxygenation remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: VCV and PCV appear to be an equally suited ventilatory technique for laparoscopic procedures in morbidly obese patients. Carbon dioxide elimination is more efficient when using VCV."

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of target-controlled infusions (TCIs) of remifentanil or sufentanil on postoperative analgesia, recovery, and pulmonary function after laparoscopic gastric banding., METHODS: Forty morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric banding received BIS-guided desflurane anaesthesia combined with remifentanil TCI (Group R) or sufentanil TCI (Group S). Intraoperative haemodynamic stability, BIS controllability, and immediate recovery in the operating room were measured. Pulmonary function, modified Aldrete score, modified Observers Assessment of Alertness and Sedation score, blood gas analysis, and visual analogue score for pain and postoperative nausea and vomiting were measured on admission to the post-anaesthesia care unit and 30, 60, 120 min afterwards. After operation, patients received patient-controlled analgesia with morphine., RESULTS: During the first two postoperative hours, cumulative morphine consumption was higher in the remifentanil group compared with the sufentanil group, but was equal values after that time. Recovery profiles and spirometry showed no significant differences. During maintenance, remifentanil gave a better haemodynamic stability., CONCLUSIONS: As few differences occurred in the postoperative period, the theoretical advantage of remifentanil over the longer acting sufentanil can be questioned when using TCI technology."

Comparison between the two groups was based on clinical and laboratory variables such as fasting blood glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), lipids, albumin, and ferritin. Patients were assessed after 7, 14, 30, 60, and 90 days and additional laboratory tests were done on the 90(th) day., RESULTS: The following mean values were recorded for groups A and B, respectively: Age (years), 36.4 and 31.1; weight (kg), 123.2 and 128.3; and body mass index (BMI; kg/m(2)), 45.6 and 47.3. In the first postoperative week, group B showed a greater weight loss (P=0.047) that was not observed after 14, 30, 60, and 90 days (P>0.05). Group A had an average excess weight loss of 31.09 kg compared to 32.69 kg in group B (P=0.222). Glycemic control was better in group B (P=0.023), whereas the control of systemic arterial pressure was better in group A (P=0.026). There were no significant differences in early lipid control and micronutrient deficiencies between the two groups., CONCLUSIONS: SG and GB were equally effective in promoting weight loss after 90 days. However, whereas SG was associated with better early remission rates for hypertension, GB was more effective in fasting blood glucose control but not in HOMA-IR and HbA1c levels.

C. K. C. De Guzman and L. T. Lao	Comparison of outcomes of bariatric surgery vs medical therapy in the management of adult patients with class I obesity	2017		CN-01439991	"INTRODUCTION: Lifestyle modification and medical therapy is the mainstay of treatment for obese patients. Bariatric surgery is an established option for obese patients with a BMI >35 (Class II_II Obesity). Studies suggest benefits of bariatric surgery for patients with a BMI of 30_35 (Class I Obesity). This study compares the effectiveness of bariatric surgery versus medical therapy in Class I obesity. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials comparing bariatric surgery and medical therapy in obesity were reviewed. Included are trials with adult, obese (Class I) populations with a 1 year follow_up period. Studies with patients with severe medical conditions, uncontrolled diabetes and/or previous bariatric/major surgery or published more than 5 years ago were excluded. Studies included were subjected to individual critical appraisal and statistical analysis. RESULTS: One hundred forty_four out of 280 patients underwent Bariatric surgery (Group A) and 136 out of 280 received medical management (Group B). Group A is associated with better glycemic control (MD _1.16, 95% CI) and weight loss (MD _15.64 kg, 95% CI), with reduced fasting plasma glucose (MD _57.60, 95% CI), triglycerides (MD _43.83, 95% CI) and systolic and diastolic BP (Systolic_ MD _9.34, 95% CI; Diastolic_ MD _2.61, 95%CI) with increased incidence of short_term complications (RR 2.03, 95% CI). No difference was observed in plasma cholesterol and LDL levels. HDL levels were increased in Group B (MD 12.27, 95% CI). CONCLUSIONS: In Class I Obesity patients, bariatric surgery is associated with better glycemic control and weight loss, with reduced blood glucose, triglycerides, systolic and diastolic BP. Medical therapy has less short_term complications with higher HDL levels. No difference was seen in plasma cholesterol and LDL levels."

The counterregulatory hormonal and sympathetic neural responses were measured during a previously reported meal test in which 48% had an almost asymptomatic hypoglycemic event., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-four randomly selected patients 4 years after RYGB. A liquid meal test (MMT) after overnight fasting. Based on the glucose nadir during the MMT, patients were divided in a hypo group (glucose < 3.3 mmol/L) and a non-hypo group (glucose >= 3.3 mmol/L). Cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, blood pressure, and heart rate were measured up to 180 min after ingestion of the meal. Incremental areas under the curve (iAUC), peak, and delta hormone responses after the glucose nadir were calculated. Parameters were compared between the hypo and non-hypo groups., RESULTS: A total of 21/44 (48%) had an almost asymptomatic hypoglycemic event. Cortisol and epinephrine responses in the hypo group were not increased compared to the non-hypo group, and there were no signs of increased sympathetic nerve activity. Peak and delta cortisol were lower in the hypo compared to the non-hypo group. Norepinephrine was higher in the hypo group especially in the time frame 60-120 and 120-180 min after start of the meal., CONCLUSION: No increase in epinephrine and a lower cortisol response to hypoglycemia were observed compared to normoglycemia during a meal test in patients after RYGB. Norepinephrine levels were higher in the hypo group. These findings may suggest that possible recurrent hypoglycemia after RYGB results in blunting of counterregulatory responses indicative of hypoglycemia-induced autonomic failure., CLIN TRIAL REGISTER ID: ISRCTN 11738149."

However, less than 2% of eligible patients who fulfill the criteria for bariatric surgery undergo the procedure. As a result, there is a drive to develop less invasive therapies to combat obesity. Endoscopic bariatric therapies (EBT) for weight loss are important since they are more effective than pharmacological treatments and lifestyle changes and present lower adverse event rates compared to bariatric surgery. Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) is a minimally invasive EBT that involves remodeling of the greater curvature. ESG demonstrated favorable outcomes in several centers, with up to 20.9% total body weight loss and 60.4% excess weight loss (EWL) on 2-year follow-up, with a low rate of severe adverse events (SAE). As such, it could be considered safe and effective in light of ASGE/ASMBS thresholds of > 25% EWL and <= 5% SAE, although there are no comparative trials to support this. Additionally, ESG showed improvement in diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and other obesity-related comorbidities. As this procedure continues to develop there are several areas that can be addressed to improve outcomes, including device improvements, technique standardization, patient selection, personalized medicine, combination therapies, and training standardization. In this editorial we discuss the origins of the ESG, current data, and future developments."

First results of a prospective study	2015	https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11695-014-1424-6		"BACKGROUND: The Magenstrasse and Mill (M&M) procedure is a vertical gastroplasty creating a tubular pouch extending from the cardia to the antrum. This ""incomplete sleeve"" avoids gastric resection or band placement. In this paper, we report our experience of the laparoscopic approach of the technique in a selected obese population excluding prominent grazer and/or sweet eaters., MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred patients (39 males, 61 females) underwent the procedure in a prospective trial. Mean age was 40 years (range 18-68). Mean preoperative BMI was 43.2 kg/m(2) (range 35-62)., RESULTS: The procedure was performed by laparoscopy starting with the creation of a circular opening at the junction of antrum and corpus followed by a vertical stapling to the angle of Hiss. Mean duration of the procedure was 67 (range 40-122) min. No intraoperative complication occurred. Mean hospital stay (SD) was 2.5 (0.9) days. The single postoperative complication consisted in a mild stenosis that responded to endoscopic dilatation. After a mean follow-up of 15 months (range 9-24), mean percentage of excess body weight loss (SD) was 48(14), 59(18) and 68(24)%, respectively at 3, 6, and 12 months. Quality of life appeared satisfactory with a low incidence of gastroesophageal reflux. The procedure was associated with improvement or resolution of diabetes, arterial hypertension, and dyslipemia at 1 year., CONCLUSIONS: Our experience demonstrated that the M&M procedure could be performed safely laparoscopically. The satisfactory results on weight loss, obesity-associated mordities, and quality of life will need to be confirmed on longer follow-up."

Such cardiometabolic states exert many deleterious effects on the heart as they are associated with adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling and, most notably, with a marked increase in the risk of developing atrial fibrillation (AF) and subsequent stroke. Epidemiological studies clearly show a strong association between obesity and AF, with a 4-5% increase in AF risk for every unit increase in BMI. The increased risk of developing AF in cardiometabolic patients is explained by changes in volume status, energy substrate utilization, tissue metabolism and systemic inflammation, all factors promoting elevation in left atrial and systolic blood pressure, LV systo-diastolic dysfunction, with subsequent atrial stretch and ""triggers"" for AF. In the present review, we critically discuss available evidence on AF risk in the cardiometabolic patient. Specific aspects will be discussed: 1) epidemiology and prognosis of AF in patients with obesity, MetS and T2D; 2) molecular mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of metabolic cardiomyopathy and left atrial remodeling; 3) advances in medical therapy including weight loss strategies and lifestyle changes; 4) new oral anticoagulants and stroke risk in obese and diabetic patients; 5) effectiveness and safety of AF catheter ablation. Taken together, these novel insights point to the development of new therapeutic strategies to combat the burden of AF in patients with cardiometabolic disturbances.Copyright © 2018 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA."

Surgery for Obesity and Weight-Related Diseases Changes the Inflammatory Profile in Women with Severe Obesity: a Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial	2021	10.1007/s11695-021-05702-5	CN-02326172	"Introduction/Purpose: Obesity increases significantly every year worldwide. Since 1980, the prevalence of individuals with obesity has practically doubled. Obesity plays an important role in the pathophysiology of diseases that arise from a complex interaction of nutritional, genetic, and metabolic factors, characterizing a chronic inflammatory state. This study aimed to verify the systemic inflammatory response through the analysis of IGF_1, IL_23, and resistin levels and the lipid profile in severely obese women undergoing surgery for obesity and weight_related diseases. Materials and Methods: This randomized controlled clinical trial includes female patients clinically diagnosed with severe obesity with an indication for bariatric surgery. Results: In the initial evaluation, no significant difference was observed between the control (CG) and bariatric surgery (BSG) groups. The weight, BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, total non_HDL cholesterol, and glucose in BSG patients showed a significant change after surgery. Pre_ and post_surgery levels of resistin, IGF_1, and IL_23 showed a significant difference in the BSG group, but only IL_23 was changed after 6 months in the CG. Conclusion: The results of this study confirmed that weight loss induced by surgery for obesity and weight_related diseases improved the lipid profile and reduced the chronic inflammatory status in women with severe obesity.

The first case of NOTES transvaginal cholecystectomy in a morbid obese patient in the literature is described. IRB approval was obtained at the institution for transvaginal NOTES clinical trials. A 58-year-old female patient with cholelithiasis, hypertension, and type II diabetes, and BMI of 35.8 kg/m(2) was submitted to the technique. After transvaginal access, a two-channel gastroscope was introduced into the abdominal cavity along with a laparoscopic trocar. There were 2 umbilical punctures for use of 3 mm laparoscopic equipment. Operative time was 85 min. There was no use of postoperative analgesia, and the patient was discharged on the third postoperative day. Transvaginal NOTES is a feasible alternative method for cholecystectomy in the morbidly obese, although available technology is limited for natural orifice surgery."

It includes a wide spectrum of liver diseases ranging from simple fatty liver to steatohepatitis, which may progress to cirrhosis, liver cancer, and liver mortality. Common metabolic diseases, which are well established cardiovascular risk factors, have been associated to NAFLD and cardiovascular disease is the single most important cause of morbidity and mortality in this patient population. The pathogenesis of NAFLD appears multifactorial and many mechanisms have been proposed as possible causes of fatty liver infiltration. Management of fatty liver has become a major challenge to healthcare systems as the consequence of the increasing rates of obesity worldwide. First-line management focuses on lifestyle modifications. Moderate weight reduction either by dietary restriction or by increased habitual physical activity is safe and highly recommended. Several therapeutic interventions have been proposed. These include insulin sensitizer agents, lipid lowering drugs, antioxidants such as vitamin E and supplementation of vitamin D3. However, therapeutic strategies have been largely empirical so far, and experimental trials have mostly been carried out in uncontrolled settings with small sample sizes. Metabolic conditions such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, should be strongly considered and a multidisciplinary approach should be personalized for individual patients. Treatment of co-morbidities should be regarded as of paramount importance in the management of these patients. The purpose of this review is to examine different approaches for the clinical management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease."

Aim(s): To describe the effects of the imposed COVID-19 confinement on the cardiometabolic health benefits acquired through a concurrent training programme that started before the pandemic in populations with morbid obesity. Method(s): This was an experimental randomized clinical study, in which sedentary morbidly obese women were assigned 1:1 to a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) plus resistance training (RT) group (HIIT + RT; n = 11; BMI 42.1 +/- 6.6) or to the same exercise dose, but in different order group of RT plus HIIT group (RT + HIIT; n = 7; BMI 47.5 +/- 8.4). Both groups undertook two sessions/week. When COVID-19 confinement at home started, a post-test was applied in January 2020 (Post1) and after 20 months (Post2). The main outcomes were waist circumference (WC), systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), high-density lipids (HDL-c), triglycerides (Tg), and fasting plasma glucose (FPG). Result(s): In the HIIT + RT group, the WC showed significant increases from Post1 to Post2 (DELTA + 3.1 cm, p = 0.035); in the RT + HIIT group, it decreased from Post1 to Post2 (DELTA - 4.8 cm, p = 0.028). In the HIIT + RT group, SBP showed significant increases from Post1 to Post2 (DELTA + 6.2 mmHg, p = 0.041); the RT + HIIT group decreased SBP from Pre0 to Post1 (DELTA - 7.2 mmHg, p = 0.026) and increased DBP from Pre0 to Post1 (DELTA + 8.1 mmHg, p = 0.015). Tg in the HIIT + RT group decreased from Pre0 to Post1 (DELTA - 40.1 mg/dL, p = 0.023) but increased from Post1 to Post2 (DELTA + 86.3 mg/dL, p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): The COVID-19 social confinement worsened metabolic syndrome (MetS) outcomes that had improved from 20 weeks' RT + HIIT during the training period, such as WC, SBP, and Tg from HIIT + RT, when, worryingly, SBP increased to another more serious clinical classification in both groups.Copyright © 2022 by the authors."

Evaluation of bariatric surgery as secondary prevention in obese patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD). Methods. Analysis of data from 4047 subjects in the Swedish Obese Subjects (SOSs) study. Thirty-five patients with IHD are treated with bariatric surgery (n = 21) or conventional treatment (n = 14). Mean follow-up is 10.8 years. Results . Bariatric surgery resulted in sustained weight loss during the study period. After 2 years, the surgery group displayed significant reductions in cardiovascular risk factors, relief from cardiorespiratory symptoms, increments in physical activity, and improved quality of life. After 10 years, recovery from hypertension, diabetes, physical inactivity, and depression was still more common in the surgery group. There were no signs of increased cardiovascular morbidity or mortality in the surgery group. Conclusion . Bariatric surgery appears to be a safe and feasible treatment to achieve long-term weight loss and improvement in cardiovascular risk factors, symptoms, and quality of life in obese subjects with IHD."

The aim of this work was to study the effect of 2 commonly performed bariatric surgical procedures; laparoscopic Roux_en_Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) and laparoscopic gastric band (BAND), on the cardiovascular risk profile in morbidly obese patients and its correlation with the plasma apolipoprotein (apo) A_IV level. Patient and method: This study was carried prospectively on 34 patients scheduled for bariatric surgery. They were randomly assigned into two groups; group 1. =BAND (18 cases), group 2. =gastric bypass RYGBP (16 cases). Both groups were studied preoperatively and twelve months after surgery. Data collected included changes of body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, fasting serum insulin, insulin resistance (HOMA_IR) and lipid profile. In addition, apo A_IV was determined by the Western blot technique. Results: The results demonstrated a highly significant reduction in body weight as determined by reduction in the BMI in both groups I & II compared to preoperative measurements. Moreover, both groups had a significantly lower systolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting serum insulin and HOMA_IR twelve months after operation. The changes in BMI, systolic blood pressure; FBG and HOMA_IR were significantly more in group II than in group I. The lipid profiles in group I & II before surgery were similar. The HDL_cholesterol was significantly higher in both groups I & II 12. months after surgery. In addition, apo A_IV levels increased after surgery in both groups. Conclusion: Both gastric band and gastric bypass are associated with significant improvement of the cardiovascular risk profile, although it is more pronounced after gastric bypass. The improvement correlates well with the increase of apo A_IV in both groups.Thus Apo A_IV may play a positive role in improving the cardiovascular risk profile after bariatric surgery. © 2012."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of Patient State Index (PSI) monitoring on recovery from anesthesia and the incidence of any postoperative complications among patients undergoing bariatric surgery with total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and inhalational anesthesia., DESIGN: This prospective, double-blind, and randomized controlled trial was conducted between February 2017 and August 2017 and included 120 morbidly obese patients (body mass index >40 kg/m2)., METHODS: Patients were randomly divided into four groups; group P-PSI (n = 30): TIVA with PSI monitoring; group P (n = 30): TIVA without PSI monitoring; group D-PSI (n = 30): desflurane with PSI monitoring; and group D (n = 30): desflurane without PSI monitoring. The discharge time from the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), postoperative complications, and hemodynamic parameters were recorded and evaluated., FINDINGS: No significant differences were found in demographic data, duration of anesthesia, admittance to PACU, discharge from PACU, modified Aldrete scores, and perioperative mean blood pressure and heart rate. Nausea and vomiting scores were significantly lower in group P-PSI, group P, and group D-PSI compared with group D., CONCLUSIONS: Although TIVA and inhalational anesthesia can be safely used for obese patients, intraoperative PSI monitoring may decrease the discharge time from PACU and reduces incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting caused by inhalation anesthetics.

Not only are more Americans overweight but also the average weight has increased an astonishing 8 lb in the last 10 years. This average gain in weight translates to a 1-2 unit increase in body mass index (BMI; kg/m2). BMI, in turn, is a simple criterion established by National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference to guide physicians regarding the relative importance of intervention [2] (Table 1). Whereas the medical complications of obesity-glucose intolerance, hypertension, dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease, gallstones, arthritis, etc.- are well established [3], an effective treatment program for obesity- weight loss-is not well established [4].

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a bariatric surgical procedure that appears to influence both the reduction of fat mass and the action of some gastrointestinal hormones., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2011 and July 2013, 23 patients with morbid obesity underwent LSG and follow-up. In the evaluation of patients, the criteria for metabolic syndrome given by the International Diabetes Federation were followed. A multidisciplinary team of experts evaluated patients before surgery and in subsequent scheduled postoperative visits at 7, 30, 60, and 90 days and 4, 5, 6, 9, and 12 months. Anthropometric and metabolic parameters were analyzed., RESULTS: The mean excess weight loss was 8.57+/-3.02%, 17.65+/-6.40%, 25.47+/-7.90%, 33.76+/-9.27%, 41.83+/-10.71%, 46.02+/-13.90%, 52.60+/-14.05%, 58.48+/-16.07%, and 62.59+/-21.29% at 7, 30, 60, and 90 days and 4, 5, 6, 9, and 12 months, respectively. In the same observational period there was an excellent improvement of metabolic indices. None of the patients previously taking prescribed hypoglycemic drugs restarted therapy. Mean fasting plasma glucose significantly decreased compared with the preoperative values. Blood pressure had a statistically significant improvement. Modification in the lipid profile was more variable. During the period of observation 22 of 23 patients reported in this study did not fit the criteria for metabolic syndrome., CONCLUSIONS: Morbid obesity and related diseases may benefit from a surgical approach in selected patients. Randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the role of LSG."

Trianto	Effects of 5: 2 intermittent energy restriction versus continuous energy restriction on cardiometabolic health: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial	2020			"Objectives: Intermittent Energy Restriction (IER) diet has increased in popularity recently. One of the most common forms of IER is 5:2 diet. We aim to summarize the most recent evidence on the efficacy of 5:2 IER diet versus continuous energy restriction (CER) on cardiometabolic health. Method(s): We systematically searched for randomized controlled trial (RCT) about 5:2 IER compared to continuous energy restriction from PubMed, EBSCO, and Scopus up to September 2020. The inclusion criteria were RCT, minimal duration of intervention >=12 weeks, and age >=18 years. The exclusion criteria were patients with eating disorder, critically ill, history of bariatric surgery, and doing other diet and exercise interventions. Mean difference was calculated with 95% confidence interval (CI) while heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistics. The primary outcomes were weight loss, blood pressure, fasting glucose, and HbA1c. Data from eligible studies were pooled for effect estimates. Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager software. Metastatistics were done using the random-effect model. Result(s): We selected eight eligible RCT studies for analysis. IER with 5:2 diet compared to CER may reduce body weight (weighted mean difference [WMD]: 1.24 kg, 95% CI 2.3-0.18, I2: 90%). Both of 5:2 IER and CER have similar effects on fasting glucose (WMD: 0.89 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.6-2.38, I2: 98%), HbA1c (WMD: 0.07%, 95% CI -0.21-0.34, I2: 81%), systolic blood pressure (WMD: 2.44 mmHg, 95% CI -3.53-8.42; I2: 0%), and diastolic blood pressure (WMD: 1.79 mmHg, 95% CI -2.86-6.43; I2: 0%). Some high heterogeneity in the analysis were attributed to the different follow-up periods and high dropout rate used in the pooled studies. Conclusion(s): IER with 5:2 diet is as effective as CER for cardiometabolic health. Future studies with high quality RCT are needed to confirm this result."

Method(s): A total of 291 overweight or obese adults with serious mental illness were enrolled in a behavioral weight loss trial. Cigarette smoking, cooccurring medical diagnoses, dietary intake, blood pressure, cardiovascular fitness, body mass index, quality of life, and psychiatric symptoms were assessed at baseline in 2008 through 2011. Fasting glucose and lipid markers were measured from blood samples. Cardiovascular risk profile was calculated based on the global Framingham Health Study Risk Equation. Result(s): A total of 128 (44%) of participants were current smokers or had smoked in the previous year. The smokers had significantly higher diastolic blood pressure and blood triglyceride levels, and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol than the nonsmokers, adjusted for age, sex, education level, and diagnosis. They were more likely to have a history of emphysema and had a 10-year cardiovascular disease risk of 13.2%, significantly higher than the 7.4% in the nonsmokers. The smokers also had elevated ratings of psychopathology on the Behavior and Symptom Identification Scale (BASIS-24). Smokers did not differ from nonsmokers in cardiovascular fitness, body mass index, depression, quality of life, or other comorbid medical diagnoses. There was no characteristic in which smokers appeared healthier than nonsmokers. Conclusion(s): The prevalence of smoking in this contemporary cohort of individuals with serious mental illness who were motivated to lose weight was more than twice that in the overall population. Smokers had more indicators of cardiovascular disease and poorer mental health than did nonsmokers. The high burden of comorbidity in smokers with serious mental illness indicates a need for broad health interventions. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

This pivotal study was designed to support LBS application to the US Food and Drug Administration for broadening the indications for surgery and the lower BMI indication was approved with 1-year data in 2011, with the intention to complete the 5-year evaluation., OBJECTIVES: To present broad health outcome data including weight change, patient reported outcomes, comorbidity change and complications during the 5-year study., SETTING: The study was conducted at seven US private practice clinical trial sites., METHODS: We enrolled 149 BMI 30-39.9 subjects into a 5-year, multicenter, longitudinal, prospective post-approval study. Data for those completing each time point are presented., RESULTS: The predefined target of at least 30% excess weight loss was achieved by more than 76% of subjects by 1-year and at every year thereafter during the 5-year study. Mean percentage weight loss at 5 years was 15.9+/-12.4%. Sustained weight loss was accompanied by sustained improvement in generic and weight-specific quality of life, symptoms of depression and the prevalence of binge-eating disorder. The number of subjects with normal fasting triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, plasma glucose and HbA1c increased significantly between baseline and 5 years. Fifty-four months after LBS implantation, the rate of device explants without replacement was 5.4%; however, the rate of explants increased to 12.1% by month 60 owing to no cost-elective band removals offered to subjects at study exit. No deaths or unanticipated adverse device effects were reported., CONCLUSIONS: The LBS is safe and effective for people with BMI 30-39.9 with demonstrated improvements in weight loss, comorbidities and quality of life, and with a low explant rate through 5 years following treatment."

W. le Roux	Improvements in the metabolic milieu following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and the arrest of diabetic kidney disease	2014	https://dx.doi.org/10.1113/expphysiol.2014.078790		"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is an efficacious intervention for morbid obesity and has a diabetes-remitting effect in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which occurs prior to significant weight loss. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is also associated with early and sustained reductions in the risk factor profile for the progression of diabetic complications. Attention is therefore now being placed on RYGB as a metabolic intervention with the capacity to yield therapeutic benefit in relation to the progression of diabetic complications, such as diabetic kidney disease. As alterations in gut anatomy following RYGB coincide with attendant shifts in downstream enteroendocrine signals with direct and indirect resolutionary effects on the kidney, the concept of an endocrine gut-kidney axis post-RYGB is growing. With the model of a gut-kidney axis in mind, this article summarizes emerging data on the effects of RYGB on risk factors for diabetic kidney disease (hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia and hypertension), highlighting a potential role for glucagon-like peptide 1 in risk factor reduction.Copyright © 2014 The Authors.

W. le Roux	Bariatric surgery for the treatment of chronic kidney disease in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus	2020	https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41581-020-0323-4		"Bariatric surgery is an effective therapy for obesity, hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus that is refractory to maximal medical therapy. Results of long-term cohort studies and emerging evidence from randomized clinical trials have revealed that, in addition to its beneficial effects on weight reduction, blood pressure and metabolic control, bariatric surgery might reduce the incidence and long-term progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Preclinical studies have provided experimental verification that bariatric surgery improves key parameters of kidney injury at the functional, structural and ultrastructural levels, and effects a programme of transcriptomic change in the kidney that is coherent with injury resolution. Multiple mechanisms explain these observations, ranging from predictable aspects of risk-factor reduction to some novel and unforeseen renoprotective benefits of surgery. Current evidence therefore supports the judicious use of bariatric surgery to treat patients with obesity, diabetes and CKD. Optimizing the benefits of surgery requires careful patient selection and consideration of how to identify and mitigate some of the challenges associated with these surgical procedures."
J. D. Douketis and A. M. Sharma	Obesity and cardiovascular disease: pathogenic mechanisms and potential benefits of weight reduction	2005			"The prevalence of obesity in industrialized countries has reached epidemic proportions, with about one in three people being obese and another one in three people being overweight and at risk of developing obesity. In recent years, obesity has gained the traditional tetrad of cardiovascular risk factors of smoking: hypertension, dyslipidemia, and dysglycemia. Attention has also focused on the importance of abdominal (or central) obesity as a determinant of cardiovascular risk, independent of the body mass index. In addition to effects on coronary artery disease, obesity has an effect on cardiovascular disease, including stroke, ventricular function, peripheral arterial disease, and venous thromboembolism. The objectives of this review are to summarize the effects of obesity on cardiovascular disease, and the possible mechanisms for these associations, and to investigate the effects of weight-loss interventions on the burden of cardiovascular disease. Large ongoing clinical outcome trials, such as the SOS study, the Look-AHEAD trial, or the SCOUT study, should provide important information on the effects of surgical and nonsurgical obesity treatment on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality."

However few international studies have evaluated their effect on patient outcome. We aimed to assess the effects of AT use on outcome in patients with high_risk UGIB requiring endoscopic therapy. Methods Patients presenting with UGIB who required endoscopic therapy at eight centres (Scotland, England, USA, Canada, Denmark, Italy, Singapore and New Zealand) were prospectively included over 12 months. Data recorded included the full Rockall score (FRS); AT use (Aspirin, Adenosine Diphosphate Receptor Inhibitors (ADP_RI), Vitamin_K Antagonists (VKA), Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH), Thrombin inhibitors and Factor Xa inhibitors); endoscopic findings; blood transfusion; interventional radiology; surgery; rebleeding; 30 day mortality and length of hospital stay. Results Out of 3154 patients, 619 required endotherapy (44% for ulcer bleeding and 21% for varices). 187 (30%) patients were on aspirin, 61 (11%) ADP_RI, 57 (9%) VKA, 8 (1%) LMWH, 7 (1%) factor Xa_inhibitor and 1 patient a thrombininhibitor. 63 (11%) patients were treated with >1 type of AT. Patients treated with ATs were older (p < 0.0001), had higher ASA_score (p = 0.001), lower haemoglobin (P = 0.04), higher FRS (p < 0.0001), more frequently had ischaemic heart disease (IHD; p < 0.001), less frequently had cirrhosis (P < 0.001), more frequently bled from ulcers (p < 0.001) but less frequently from varices (p < 0.001) compared with those not taking ATs. There were no differences in sex, systolic blood pressure, frequency of malignancies, need for surgery/embolisation or rebleeding rate. Patients taking ATs had lower mortality than those not taking these drugs: all cause (11/253 [4%] vs 37/315 [12%]; p = 0.006) and bleeding_ related (3/253 [1%] vs 19/315 [6%]; p = 0.01). However, when excluding patients with liver cirrhosis (n = 151) there were no differences in mortality between groups. Conclusion Patients with UGIB who require endoscopic therapy whilst on ATs do not experience a higher rate of rebleeding or mortality compared with UGIB patients who do not use ATs. We observed excess mortality in patients not taking ATs, which is likely due to the high rates of cirrhosis (40%) and variceal bleeding (33%) in these patients. Further studies are needed to clarify the risk of adverse outcome following UGIB in patients taking novel ATs."

Method(s): The patients were randomized and divided into two groups each comprising 74 patients. CP and mobilization was applied to the patients in the first group, and only mobilization was applied to the patients in the second group. The treatment of the patients was started on the first postoperative day and continued until the postoperative 4th day. CP and mobilization were applied twice a day, 8 times in total. The following parameters were evaluated: arterial blood gas, oxygen saturation, respiratory function test for pulmonary functions, pulmonary artery pressure for pulmonary hypertension, Borg dyspnea score for severity of dyspnea, 6-min walk test(6MWT) for functional capacity, Nottingham Health Profile for quality of life. Result(s): The mean age of the patients was 38.00 +/- 7.04 years. Compared with pretreatment and posttreatment dyspnea score, 6MWT, oxygen saturation, vital capacity, tidal volume, PEF, pulmonary arterial pressure, and quality of life were significantly higher in patients who underwent CP compared with the control group(p = 0.008, 0.004, 0.005, 0.027, 0.029, 0.028, 0.007, 0.012).There was a significant improvement in all the parameters of the patients who underwent chest physiotherapy when compared with the intragroup comparisons, whereas in the control group, only 6MWT and quality of life score showed a significant improvement in the border (p = 0.037, 0.046). Conclusion(s): Postoperative CP applied to patients who had bariatric surgery showed that the patients improved their respiratory functions, regulated arterial blood gases, increased oxygen saturation, functional capacity and quality of life, and decreased dyspnea levels.Copyright © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"M. A. Edwards, R. Grinbaum, B. E. Schneider, A. Walsh, J. Ellsmere and D. B. Jones"	Benchmarking hospital outcomes for laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding	2007			"BACKGROUND: Since the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of laparoscopic adjustable gastric bands (LAGB) in June 2001, the number LAGB procedures performed in the United States has increased exponentially. This study aimed to benchmark the authors' initial hospital experience to FDA research trials and evidence-based literature., METHODS: Over a 2-year period, 87 consecutive patients with a mean age of 43 years (range, 21-64 years) and a body mass index of 45.6 kg/m2 (range, 35-69 kg/m2) underwent an LAGB procedure at the authors' institution. The authors conducted a retrospective review of the outcomes including conversion, reoperation, mortality, perforation, erosion, prolapse, port dysfunction, excess weight loss, and changes in comorbidities, then compared the data with published benchmarks., RESULTS: Gender, age, and body mass index were comparable with those of other series. Perioperative adverse events included acute stoma obstruction (n = 1) and respiratory complications (n = 2). Delayed complications included gastric prolapse (n = 4) and port reservoir malposition (n = 4). Five bands were explanted. The mean follow-up period was 14 months (n = 79). The mean percentage of excess weight loss was 30% (range, 4.7-69%) at 6 months, 41% (range, 9.6-82%) at 12 months, and 47% (range, 14-92%) at 24 months. Comorbidities resolved included diabetes (74%), hypertension (57%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (55%) and dyslipidemia (38%)., CONCLUSIONS: The short-term outcomes for LAGB were comparable with published benchmarks. With adequate weight loss, most patients achieve significant improvement in obesity-related illnesses. With new bariatric accreditation standards and mandates required for financial reimbursement, hospitals will need to demonstrate that their clinical outcomes are consistent with best practices. The authors' early experience shows that LAGB achieves significant weight loss with low mortality and morbidity rates. Despite a more gradual weight loss, most patients achieve excellent weight loss with corresponding improvement of comorbidities within the first 2 years postoperatively."

This pilot study was undertaken in a single, tertiary referral centre. Data on all patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension that have undergone laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding in our unit were collected from our prospectively maintained bariatric database. Additional information was obtained via telephone questionnaires and review of medical records. Four female patient with a mean age of 32 years (range 29-39 years) and mean pre-operative body mass index of 46.1 kg/m(2) (range 38.2-54.0 kg/m(2)) underwent laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding between June 2006 and July 2009. At a mean follow-up of 19.8 months all four patients reported either total resolution of headache or significant improvement in headache, with a mean improvement in pain score of 76.3/100 (range 55-95) on a analogue pain score. Mean excess weight loss at follow-up was 64.1% (range 50.1-88.2%). There were no complications or mortality in this cohort. This study suggests that laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding represents an effective and safe treatment for idiopathic intracranial hypertension associated with morbid obesity. We have shown good results both in terms of symptom resolution and weight loss, whilst avoiding alimentary tract diversion procedures in these young female patients. A randomized, controlled trial can be justified on the basis of this initial pilot study."

The study compared an optimised exercise program with standard routine postoperative care to determine if optimising the exercise regime of patients in the post_surgical phase of weight loss further significantly contributes to this surgical weight loss. Methods: A randomised controlled trial comparing an intensified exercise regime and usual exercise prescribed for standard care. The study was conducted within a university research centre attached to one of Melbourne's major teaching hospitals and followed 50 subjects for a period of three months. Outcomes of interest were body composition (via DEXA), program compliance, blood pressure, and biochemical markers. Results: The mean difference in weight lost between the optimized exercise group and the standard care group was analysed using SPSS. Pilot data indicates a weight loss of 5.9 (+/_ 4.1) kgs in the exercise group compared to 3.5 (+/_ 2.6) kg in the standard care group. There also appear to be greater improvements in all other outcome measures in favour of the exercise group. Conclusion: From preliminary data exercise appears to be beneficial in aiding weight loss and positively influencing health status in this population."

Aiming for optimal management of this challenging patient cohort, tailored concepts directly guided by individual patient physiology may outperform standardized care. Implying esophageal pressure measurement and electrical impedance tomography-increasingly applied monitoring approaches to individually adjust mechanical ventilation in challenging circumstances like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and intraabdominal hypertension-we compared our institutions standard ventilator regimen with an individually adjusted positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) level aiming for a positive transpulmonary pressure (PL) throughout the respiratory cycle. Method(s): After obtaining written informed consent, 37 patients scheduled for elective bariatric surgery were studied during mechanical ventilation in reverse Trendelenburg position. Before and after installation of capnoperitoneum, PEEP levels were gradually raised from a standard value of 10 cm H2O until a PL of 0 +/- 1 cm H2O was reached. Changes in ventilation were monitored by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and arterial blood gases (ABGs) were obtained at the end of surgery and 5 and 60 min after extubation, respectively. Result(s): To achieve the goal of a transpulmonary pressure (PL) of 0 cm H2O at end expiration, PEEP levels of 16.7 cm H2O (95% KI 15.6-18.1) before and 23.8 cm H2O (95% KI 19.6-40.4) during capnoperitoneum were necessary. EIT measurements confirmed an optimal PEEP level between 10 and 15 cm H2O before and 20 and 25 cm H2O during capnoperitoneum, respectively. Intra- and postoperative oxygenation did not change significantly. Conclusion(s): Patients during laparoscopic bariatric surgery require high levels of PEEP to maintain a positive transpulmonary pressure throughout the respiratory cycle. EIT monitoring allows for non-invasive monitoring of increasing PEEP demand during capnoperitoneum. Individually adjusted PEEP levels did not result in improved postoperative oxygenation.Copyright © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

RNA was extracted from subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral (VAT) AT biopsies from 40 patients randomized to metabolic gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy or greater curvature plication. Biochemical parameters, fasting plasma insulin, glucagon and area under the curve (AUC) of GLP-1 following a standard meal test were determined before and 1 year after bariatric surgery. GLP-1R expression was higher in VAT than in SAT. GLP-1R expression in VAT correlated with weight (r = -0.453, p = 0.008), waist circumference (r = -0.494, p = 0.004), plasma insulin (r = -0.466, p = 0.007), and systolic blood pressure (BP) (r = -0.410, p = 0.018). At 1 year, GLP-1R expression in VAT was negatively associated with diastolic BP (r = -0.361, p = 0.039) and, following metabolic gastric bypass, with the increase of GLP-1 AUC, (R2 = 0.46, p = 0.038). Finally, GLP-1R in AT was similar independently of diabetes outcomes and was not associated with weight loss after surgery. Thus, GLP-1R expression in AT is of limited value to predict incretin response and does not play a role in metabolic outcomes after bariatric surgery."

Tobar	Intraperitoneal bupivacaine-meperidine for postoperative analgesia after laparoscopic gastric banding in morbidly obese patients	2009		CN-00802896	"Objectives: Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) is a safe and effective treatment for morbid obesity, and is commonly performed as an outpatient procedure. The aim of this study is to compare between intraperitoneal (IP) bupivacaine alone and IP bupivacaine_meperidine for postoperative analgesia after outpatient LAGB. Methods: 50 morbidly obese patients (BMI >40 kg/m2) undergoing outpatient LAGB were included in the study. At the end of the procedure, patients were randomized to receive either 40 mL of bupivacaine 0.25% alone (group B), or combined with meperidine 50 mg (group BM), instilled under vision into the peritoneal cavity, splashed around the sites of dissection and at the undersurface of the diaphragm. Pain scores were assessed every postoperative hour at rest and on coughing. Total meperidine consumption by PCA and time to first PCA dose were measured. Mean arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, SpO2, and EtCO 2 were assessed preoperatively and every postoperative hour. Incentive spirometery (IS) was assessed preoperatively and one hour postoperatively. Sedation scores, time to discharge from the PACU, and time to discharge from hospital were also measured. Results: Pain scores were significantly lower in group BM compared to group B. Total meperidine consumption by PCA was significantly lower in group BM compared to group B (24.4 + 16.4 vs 42.8 + 22.3 mg, p<0.05). This was accompanied by shorter time to discharge from the PACU and time to discharge from hospital in group BM. IS values were significantly reduced in the postoperative measurement in both groups compared to baseline. However, IS was significantly higher in group BM compared to group B (2104 + 305 vs 1824 + 320 mL, p<0.05). Conclusion: We conclude that IP bupivacaine_meperidine produces better analgesia than IP bupivacaine alone. This was evident in the lower pain scores, lower meperidine consumption by PCA, shorter PACU stay, shorter hospital stay, and better IS values when IP bupivacaine_meperidine was used."

Inclusion criteria: Manuscripts published in English, randomized clinical trials (RCT), prospective or retrospective analyses comparing surgical treatment with MGB or RYGB in adult populations with BMI >= 35 kg/m2or BMI > 30 kg/m2 if comorbidities exist. Data regarding %EWL, BMI, adverse events such as major complications, and resolution of comorbidities was extracted. Exclusion criteria: non-human studies, non-surgical interventions, case reports, conference abstracts, letters/comments, and studies with patient follow up o1 year. Result(s): 11 studies (1 RCT, 5 prospective, 5 retrospective) were included for analysis;767 patients underwent MGB, and 1174 patients underwent RYGB. Overall, MGB patients had comparable or greater weight loss versus RYGB patients (mean %EWL range after MGB = 29.5 127.0 and after RYGB = 40.93 94.0; mean BMI range for MGB pre-surgery = 37.4 67.0 and post-surgery = 23.8 28.5; for RYGB pre-surgery = 37.5 64.4 and post-surgery = 26.5 32.0.). In addition, MGB required less operative time (mean = 92.9 147.7 minutes versus 129.5 205.0 minutes for RYGB), with post-operative stay comparable to or less than RYGB [2.0 6.9 days versus 2.0 5.5days for RYGB). Marginal ulcer was reported in 7/362 RYGB and 15/523 MGB patients, and bile reflux was reported in 0/322 RYGB and 9/483 MGB patients. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus was resolved in 53/90 RYGB and 86/97 MGB patients and hypertension was improved in 93/153 RYGB and 65/103 MGB patients.

It is still unclear which anaesthesia regimen is better for this group of patients. The present study has been conducted to compare the use of the inhalation anaesthesia technique using desflurane with the TIVA technique, using propofol and dexmedetomidine., DESIGN: Prospective, randomised, double-blinded study., SETTING: Menoufia Univeristy Hospital., PATIENTS: This randomised trial was carried out on 100 morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. The patients were randomised into two equally sized groups; one group received the inhalation anaesthesia technique and the other received the TIVA technique., INTERVENTIONS: All patients received general anaesthesia, which was induced by propofol, remifentanil, and rocuronium. Anaesthesia was maintained using desflurane in oxygen air mixture in the inhalation group, whilst anaesthesia was maintained by intravenous infusion of propofol and dexmedetomidine in the TIVA group., MEASUREMENTS: Intra-operative vital signs, anaesthesia recovery time, postoperative nausea and vomiting, pain score, post-anaesthetic care unit (PACU) stay time, total first 24h post-operative analgesic needs and the onset of first bowel movement were recorded. Main results The TIVA group had lower intra-operative heart rates and mean arterial blood pressure (P<0.0001). The TIVA group also had a lower post-operative visual analogue score for pain assessment (VAS) (P<0.0001), lower total analgesic requirements (P<0.0001), a lower incidence of nausea (P=0.01) and vomiting (P=0.03), and shorter PACU stays (P=0.01). There was no significant difference between groups with regard to the onset of bowel movement (P=0.16)., CONCLUSIONS: TIVA using propofol and dexmedetomidine is a better anaesthetic regimen than inhalation anaesthesia using desflurane for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in morbidly obese patients.

Weight loss has demonstrated successful disease-modifying effects; however, the long-term cost-effectiveness of weight loss interventions for the treatment of IIH has not yet been established. Objective(s): To estimate the cost-effectiveness of weight-loss treatments for IIH. Setting(s): Single-payer healthcare system (National Health Service, England). Method(s): A Markov model was developed comparing bariatric surgery with a community weight management intervention over 5-, 10-, and 20-year time horizons. Transition probabilities, utilities, and resource use were informed by the IIH Weight Trial (IIH:WT), alongside the published literature. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to characterize uncertainty within the model. Result(s): In the base case analysis, over a 20-year time horizon, bariatric surgery was ""dominant,"" led to cost savings of 49,500, and generated an additional 1.16 quality-adjusted life years in comparison to the community weight management intervention. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated a probability of 98% that bariatric surgery is the dominant option in terms of cost-effectiveness. Conclusion(s): This economic modeling study has shown that when compared to community weight management, bariatric surgery is a highly cost-effective treatment option for IIH in women living with obesity. The model shows that surgery leads to long-term cost savings and health benefits, but that these do not occur until after 5 years post surgery, and then gradually increase over time.Copyright © 2021 American Society for Bariatric Surgery"

Kalarchian"	Medication Use Among Patients Prior to Bariatric Surgery	2015			"Purpose: The aims of this study were to describe the most common medications reported by candidates for weight loss surgery and to consider the potential implications for patient care. Methods: A secondary data analysis of data from bariatric surgery patients enrolled in a randomized, controlled trial. At study entry, participants recorded their use of prescription medications they had taken in the previous 90 days. The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC)/Defined Daily Dose (DDD) Index 2014 was used to classify medications. Results: Participants (n=265) were 85.7% female and 83.0% white. Mean body mass index was 47.9+/-6.5 kg/m2, and age was 45.1+/-11 years. The average number of medications was 4.4+/-4.1, and the median was 3. The top three anatomical main groups were the cardiovascular system, alimentary tract and metabolism, and nervous system (28.2%, 21.6%, and 21.3% of all medications, respectively). The top therapeutic subgroups were drugs used in diabetes, psychoanaleptics, and agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system (12%, 11.3%, and 8.2% of all medications, respectively). Conclusions: Candidates for weight loss surgery report taking medications associated with obesity-related comorbidities such as diabetes, depression, and hypertension. Although many may be able to eliminate these medications, others will require close monitoring and dosage adjustment after surgery."

Does it make a difference? a randomized controlled clinical study	2019	10.2174/2589645801913010031	CN-01979554	"Background: Impaired respiratory functions during general anesthesia are commonly caused by lung atelectasis more in morbidly obese patients. This occurs more frequently with laparoscopic surgery due to trendelenburg position and pneumoperitoneum. Preemptive recruitment maneuver + PEEP results in the prevention of these changes. Aim: To quantitate the effects of RM and PEEP on intraoperative hypoxemia and respiratory mechanics during laparoscopic gastric banding in obese patients. Study Design: A randomized, double_blinded, controlled study. Method and Materials: Fifty adults ASA I_II, BMI (40_50 kg/m2) for elective laparoscopic gastric banding were randomized into, groups C, and RM, 25 patients each. Group C patients received standard ventilation, VT 6 ml/kg, I: E ratio 1: 2 PEEP 5 cm H2 O, and respiratory rate 10_12 breaths/ min. RM patients received standard ventilation with one alveolar recruitment maneuver after mechanical ventilation with PEEP of 15 cm H2 O till the end of the surgery. Heart rate, mean blood pressure, respiratory mechanical parameters: peak airway pressure, plateau pressure and end_expiratory lung volume, PaO2, PaO2/FiO2 and (SpO2) were assessed. Results: PaO2 and PaO2 /FiO2 ratio increased significantly in the RM group after RM from T2 (before pneumoperitoneum) to T6 (end of surgery) compared with group C (P < 0.001). Peak and plateau airway pressures increased significantly in group C from T2 till T5 (60 min after pneumoperitoneum) compared with the RM group (P < 0.001). End_expiratory lung volume increased significantly in the RM group after RM compared with group C (P<0.001). Conclusion: Preemptive RM with PEEP of 15 cm H2 O was effective in preventing pneumoperitoneum_induced intraoperative hypoxemia and respiratory mechanics changes."

Previous reports have shown significant weight loss and improvement in type 2 diabetes for up to 6 months., METHODS: Morbidly obese subjects were enrolled in a single arm, open label, prospective trial and implanted with the DJBL. Primary endpoints included safety and weight change from baseline to week 52. Secondary endpoints included changes in waist circumference, blood pressure, lipids, glycemic control, and metabolic syndrome., RESULTS: The DJBL was implanted endoscopically in 39 of 42 subjects (age: 36 +/- 10 years; 80% female; weight: 109 +/- 18 kg; BMI: 43.7 +/- 5.9 kg/m); 24 completed 52 weeks of follow-up. Three subjects could not be implanted due to short duodenal bulb. Implantation time was 24 +/- 2 minutes. There were no procedure-related complications and there were 15 early endoscopic removals. In the 52-week completer population, total body weight change from baseline was -22.1 +/- 2.1 kg (P < 0.0001) corresponding to 19.9 +/- 1.8% of total body weight and 47.0 +/- 4.4% excess of weight loss. There were also significant improvements in waist circumference, blood pressure, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and fasting glucose., CONCLUSIONS: The DJBL is safe when implanted for 1 year, and results in significant weight loss and improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors. These results suggest that this device may be suitable for the treatment of morbid obesity and its related comorbidities. This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00985491)."

Patients with body mass index (BMI) 40-50 kg/m2 are at more risk of weight regain and relapse of comorbidities. There is a controversy on the optimum alimentary (AL) and biliopancreatic (BPL) limb lengths to be used in RYGB to achieve weight loss and remission of comorbidities without causing nutritional deficiencies in those patients. Study Design: hundred-and-fifty patients with BMI between 40 and 50 kg/m2 were divided equally into 2 groups undergoing standard RYGB (S-RYGB) with AL:150 cm and BPL: 50 cm and long biliopancreatic RYGB (L-RYGB) with AL: 100 cm and BPL: 100 cm. BMI, % of total weight loss (%TWL), effect on diabetes (DM), hypertension (HTN), dyslipidemia, and nutritional statuses were recorded at 1, 2, and 3 years. Result(s): Only 64/75 patients in S-RYGB and 57/75 patients in L-RYGB completed the study. L-RYGB had faster weight loss, higher %TWL, and less BMI than S-RYGB with the maintenance of achieved weight. L-RYGB had better control of DM and dyslipidemia than S-RYGB. There were no significant differences in nutritional status between S-RYGB and L-RYGB rather than lower levels of calcium and Hb and higher levels of PTH in L-RYGB yet they remain within the normal range. Conclusion(s): The application of L-RYGB helps in achieving faster weight loss for a longer period with better remission of associated comorbidities as DM, HTN, and dyslipidemia in patients with BMI 40-50 kg/m2 but with effects on the nutritional status.

Patients' physical activity (PA) levels and outcomes were followed over their first postoperative year. METHODS: Patients slated for bariatric surgery were randomized to a control group (n = 64) (basic information about postoperative PA) or an intervention group (n = 57) (also received physical therapist_prescribed PAP). Outcome measures were self_reported PA/exercise and sedentary time; and weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, and blood lipids; recorded pre_operatively and at 2, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Follow_ups were conducted by nurses/dieticians. Trial registration: ""Research and Development in Sweden"" number 107371. RESULTS: There were no differences between the groups except for higher level of PA (579 vs. 182 minutes/week) six months after surgery (p = .046) and a larger decrease in cholesterol (_24 vs. _8%) after a year (p = .017) in the intervention group. Patients in both groups lost considerable weight, had reduced waist circumference, and increased PA (p < .001). CONCLUSION: Although marked differences between groups were not observed over one year, the intervention group increased its PA 6_months postoperatively, but not at other time points. Whether long_term outcomes of PAP use are more robust with physical therapist participation across follow_ups warrants study."

Objective(s): We undertook systematic review and meta-analysis of medium and long-term outcomes following Roux en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) and Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG). Method(s): We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed and Cochrane databases for cohort studies or randomised trials of adults undergoing RYGB (10-year outcomes) and SG (5 and 10-year outcomes). A random-effects meta-analysis examined excess weight loss (%EWL) or BMI loss (%EBMIL) and remission of diabetes/hypertension/sleep apnoea. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using I2 statistic and publication bias by funnel plots and Egger's linear regression test. Result(s): There were 5 studies for RYGB and 22 for SG. At 5-years for SG, EWL was 62.6% (95%CI 55.9%-69.4%; I2=93%;13 studies) and EBMIL was 62.3% (95%CI 42.9%-81.6%; I2=96%;3 studies). At 10-years for RYGB, EWL was 65.2% (95%CI 63.3%-67.1%; I2=82%;4 studies) and EBMIL was 68% (95%CI 59%-77%;1 study). For SG at 5+ years, diabetes remission occurred in 54% (95%CI 43%-62%; I2=74%;10 studies), hypertension in 56% (95%CI 35%-75%; I2=85%;7 studies) and sleep apnoea in 75% (95%CI 33%-95%; I2=91%;5 studies). Current results were limited by high attrition rates, heterogeneity and publication bias. Conclusion(s): RYGB and SG are efficacious in maintaining long and medium-term weight loss, respectively, however, existing studies were limited by high attrition rates."

However, possible advantages of a liquid diet over one of normal consistency are controversial. This study investigated the effect of a liquid VLCD compared with one of normal consistency considering visceral fat (VF) loss and metabolic profile in preoperative clinically severe obese patients. METHODS: This was a randomized, open_labeled, controlled clinical trial. Patients were divided into 2 groups: liquid diet and normal diet. Data were collected at baseline and 7 and 14 days after intervention. Information gathered was analyzed for loss of weight and VF, biochemical data, anthropometric data, and energy intake. RESULTS: Fifty_seven patients consumed the liquid diet and 47 consumed the normal consistency diet. The liquid diet group lost significantly more weight (P<.0290) and VF (P<.0410) than the normal diet group. An inverse correlation occurred between VF loss and surgical time among the liquid diet group (r2=_.1302, P=.001). Additionally, there was a positive correlation between the percentage of excess weight loss and ketonuria (P=.0070). No between_group difference occurred regarding calorie intake. CONCLUSION: Patients that consumed a liquid diet presented a positive effect on reducing VF and greater weight loss than the normal diet group. Both VLCDs presented benefits offering a protective effect during the preoperative stage."

Postoperative respiratory failure and airway obstruction after bariatric surgery can often be attributed to the residual depressant effects of anaesthetics, sedatives and opioids. Peri-operative management of morbidly obese patients is still a concern for operating room professionals., OBJECTIVE: The evaluation of the effects of doxapram on the outcomes of general anaesthesia following bariatric surgical procedures in the morbidly obese., DESIGN: A single-blind randomised controlled trial with two parallel arms., SETTING: A tertiary care teaching hospital, Tehran, Iran, from 2017 to 2018., PARTICIPANTS: In total, 100 patients (69 women) with at least class two obesity were included in two groups of equal sizes and underwent bariatric surgery., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the time from the administration of doxapram to tracheal extubation. Secondary outcomes included vital signs and variables including peak expiratory flow rate, time to return to spontaneous breathing, time to eye-opening and hand-squeezing on the commands, and time to recovery., INTERVENTIONS: Both groups underwent general anaesthesia. The intervention group received a single dose of doxapram 1 mg kg ideal body weight, immediately after reversal of neuromuscular blockade and after discontinuation of all anaesthetics., RESULTS: Doxapram decreased time to extubation, time to eye-opening and hand-squeezing, shortened recovery time and lowered end-tidal CO2 significantly (all P < 0.001). Moreover, it increased peak expiratory flow rate, oxygen saturation, temperature, heart rate and blood pressure (all P < 0.001). The two groups were similar in the bispectral index and mean arterial pressure (both P > 0.05). None of our participants had complications attributable to doxapram., CONCLUSION: The postoperative use of doxapram improves peak expiratory flow rate, and decreases respiratory complications of anaesthesia during recovery in the morbidly obese undergoing bariatric surgery. Doxapram is well tolerated in young ASA physical status classes 1 to 2 morbidly obese patients; however, the anaesthesiologist should cautiously evaluate the vital signs for at least half an hour following the administration of doxapram., REGISTRATION: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) http://www.irct.ir/ number IRCT2017060712203N9."

Obesity worsens the course of CKD, mainly defined by an abnormal glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Patients with severe obesity stages (II and III with body mass index >35 kg/m2) are eligible for bariatric surgery (BS), which is the most efficient method of achieving durable weight loss. BS may reverse glomerular hyperfiltration and albuminuria, improve adipocytokine profile, and relieve diabetes and hypertension. Obesity remission after BS might prevent the progression of renal failure in populations with morbid obesity. However, evidence for the beneficial effect of BS on renal function is scant. This lack of knowledge is mainly due to methodologic reasons, which are addressed in this review. The reversibility of hyperfiltration due to the presence of functional renal reserve hampers the interpretation of changes in true GFR after BS. This true GFR is only obtained with the renal clearance of an exogenous filtration marker. Estimation of GFR is generally provided by prediction equations, namely by modification of diet in renal diseases or by chronic kidney disease-epidemiology collaborative group. These equations are not accurate because the serum levels of both creatinine and cystatin C depend on extrarenal factors, which are modified by BS. Comparing the slopes of measured GFR according to various durations of exposure with morbid obesity would be critical in providing reliable data. Herein, we review the current knowledge on the effects of BS on kidney function; we specify the methodologic issues and particularities of the dietary management of CKD patients to propose reliable directions for future clinical research.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Bariatric Surgery"

We evaluated whether dexmedetomidine infusion could replace fentanyl for facilitation of open gastric bypass surgery. DESIGN: Randomized, single blinded, open label. SETTING: University teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty bariatric patients with an average body mass index of 54 to 61 kg/m2 undergoing surgery for open gastric bypass. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive either fentanyl (0.5_microg/kg bolus, 0.5 microg.kg(_1).h(_1), n = 10) or dexmedetomidine (0.5_microg/kg bolus, 0.4 microg.kg(_1).h(_1), n = 10) for intraoperative analgesia.

Objective(s): This study investigated the Ideal Protein (IP) system, a commercial weight loss program, compared to a guideline-based, low-calorie/low-fat (LCLF) dietary behavioral intervention on body weight and CVD risk factors in adults with obesity. Method(s): In this randomized, assessor-blinded, parallel-group trial, 192 participants with body mass index (BMI) >=30 and <=49 kg/m2 were assigned to either the IP Phase I diet or LFLC diet interventions. The IP Phase I is focused on lean protein and vegetables with avoidance of fruit and dairy, while the LFLC diet goals include <30% of daily energy from fat, <7% from saturated fat, 55% from carbohydrate, and an energy deficit of 500 kcal/day. The primary endpoint was change in body weight at 3 months. Secondary endpoints included change in waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), fasting glucose (FG), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Result(s): The mean +/- SD of change in weight at 3 months was -9.6 +/- 12.7 kg in the IP group as compared to -1.6 +/- 27.2 kg in the LFLC group. The mean between-group difference in change at 3 months was -8.1 kg (95% confidence interval [CI] -16.6 to 0.6; p = 0.05). Additional significant between-group differences included WC, HC, TC, and TG levels, all favoring the IP group. There were no serious adverse events during the intervention period. Conclusion(s): The present findings demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the IP weight loss program as compared to a guideline-based LCLF dietary behavioral intervention among black and white adults with obesity and CVD risk factors, providing support for the effectiveness of the program.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

We have previously found an association between the class of peri-operative, intravenous antibiotic administered at the time of RYGB and the resolution rate of hypertension suggesting the gut microbiome as a mechanism. In this study, we performed a prospective study of RYGB to determine if a single intravenous antibiotic could alter the gastrointestinal microbial composition., METHODS: Patients undergoing RYGB were randomized to a single, peri-operative antibiotic of intravenous cefazolin (n = 8) or clindamycin (n = 8). Stool samples were collected from four-time points: 2 weeks pre-op (- 2w), 2 days pre-op (- 2d), 2 weeks post-op (+ 2w) and 3 months post-op (+ 3m). Stool samples were processed for genomic DNA followed by Illumina 16S rRNA gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomic sequencing (MGS)., RESULTS: A total of 60 stool samples (- 2w, n = 16; - 2d, n = 15; + 2w, n = 16; + 3m, n = 13) from 16 patients were analyzed. 87.5% of patients were female with an average age of 48.6 +/- 12.2 years and pre-operative BMI of 50.9 +/- 23.3 kg/m2. RYGB induced statistically significant differences in alpha and beta diversity. There were statistically significant differences in alpha diversity at + 2w and beta diversity at + 3m due to antibiotic treatment. MGS revealed significantly distinct gut microbiota with 11 discriminatory metagenomic assembled genomes driven by antibiotic treatment at 3 months post-op, including increased Bifidobacterium spp. with clindamycin., CONCLUSION: RYGB induces significant changes in the gut microbiome at 2 weeks that are maintained 3 months after surgery. However, the single peri-operative dose of antibiotic administered at the time of RYGB induces unique and persisting changes to the gut microbiome that are antibiotic-specific. Increased Bifidobacterium spp. with clindamycin administration may improve the metabolic efficacy of RYGB when considering gut-microbiome driven mechanisms for blood pressure resolution.

Every child received a nutritionally balanced diet and had to record their appetite and to describe their meals in a diary. Results: Even if we found a significant reduction in BMI, weight and waist circumference in both groups, no statistically significant differences between groups were noted. We did not found any significant differences in appetite between group A and B. Conclusion: Our data show that Tuberil has no efficacy neither in reducing appetite in children nor in increasing dietary compliance.

New pharmacological strategies that focus on people with class III obesity are required. Metformin and dapagliflozin are two drugs approved for the treatment of diabetes. Beyond its effects on glucose, metformin has been suggested by some studies to result in weight loss. Therapy with dapagliflozin is associated with a mild but sustained weight loss in patients with diabetes. The primary outcome of the study is to determine if the combined treatment with dapagliflozin and metformin is more effective than monotherapy with metformin for weight loss in patients with class III obesity and prediabetes or diabetes who are awaiting bariatric surgery (including those patients who do have surgery). We also aimed to assess the effect of this combined treatment on waist circumference, triglycerides, blood pressure, and inflammatory cytokines., METHODS: This randomized phase IV clinical trial will include patients with diabetes or prediabetes who are between the ages of 18 and 60 years and exhibit grade III obesity (defined as body mass index >= 40 kg/m2). Patients using insulin will be excluded. Subjects will be randomized to one of two groups as follows: 1) metformin tablets 850 mg PO bid or 2) metformin tablets 850 mg PO bid plus dapagliflozin tablets 10 mg PO qd. The sample size required is 108 patients, which allows for a 20% dropout rate: 54 patients in the metformin group and 54 in the metformin/dapagliflozin group. All participants will receive personalized nutritional advice during the study. A run-in period of one month will be used to assess tolerance and adherence to treatment regimens. Anthropometric and biochemical variables will be recorded at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. A serum sample to determine glucagon, ghrelin, adiponectin, resistin, interleukin 6, and interleukin 10 will be collected at baseline and before surgery, or at 12 months (whatever happens first). Adherence to treatment and adverse and secondary events will be recorded throughout the study. An intention-to-treat analysis will be used., DISCUSSION: Forty-six percent of the patients in our Obesity Clinic have been diagnosed with prediabetes (32%) or diabetes (14%). The use of dapagliflozin in this population could improve weight loss and other cardiovascular factors. This effect could be translated into less time before undergoing bariatric surgery and better control of associated comorbidities., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov, ID: NCT03968224.

While current anti-obesity medications are effective and offer real clinical benefits over diet and lifestyle interventions, they cannot meet the levels of efficacy and reduction of hard endpoint outcomes seen with bariatric surgery. As knowledge on the control of body weight unravels, the complexity of this physiology opens the opportunity to new druggable targets. Currently, gut peptide analogues such as semaglutide, a glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, and the dual agonist GLP-1 and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) tirzepatide are the furthest advanced in clinical development and seem likely to meet current regulatory requirements within the next year or so. However, current regulatory requirements are out of step with the efficacy of new compounds and concepts relating to obesity and its complications. Many other drugs in early development will target different pathways of energy balance, raising the possibility of drug combinations to maximise efficacy as for other chronic disease such as hypertension and diabetes. This will allow more complex and personalised guidelines to evolve.Copyright © 2021 European Federation of Internal Medicine"

Capewell"	Analysing the coronary heart disease mortality decline from 1988 to 2005 in Spain: modelling study	2010		CN-01783775	"Background: TheÒMediterranean ParadoxÓ means that countries such as Spain, Italy and France experience lower cardiovascular mortality than Northern Europe or the USA given similar levels of cardiovascular risk factors. Cardiovascular mortality has been decreasing for several decades, but the contributory factors remain unquantified. Objective: We examined the extent to which the decrease in Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) mortality rates in Spain between 1988 and 2005 could be explained by changes in cardiovascular risk factors and by the use of medical and surgical treatments. Methods: We used a previously validated IMPACT model to combine and analyze data on risk factor prevalence trends, and uptake and effectiveness of evidence_based cardiac treatments among adult men and women aged 35_74 years. Main data sources included official mortality statistics, results of longitudinal studies, national surveys, randomized controlled trials and metaanalyses. The difference between observed and expected CHD deaths in 2005 was then partitioned among treatments and risk factors. We also performed a sensitivity analysis to quantify the potential effect of parameter uncertainty. Results: From 1988 to 2005, the age_adjusted CHD mortality rates in Spain fell by almost 40% among persons aged 35 to 74 years, resulting in 8,528 fewer CHDdeaths in 2005. Approximately 48% of the fall in deaths was attributed to treatments and approximately 51% to changes in risk factors. The major treatment contributions came from initial therapy for acute coronary syndromes (explaining approximately 12% of the mortality fall), secondary prevention (10%) and heart failure (4%). Decreases in total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and smoking prevalence explained approximately 37%, 24% and 16% of the mortality fall, respectively. However, important gender differences in risk factor trends were noted: diabetes and obesity increasing in men and smoking prevalence rose in young women. Conclusions: Approximately half of the CHD mortality fall in Spain between 1988 and 2005 was attributable to reductions in major risk factors, and half to evidence_based therapies. These results increase understanding of past trends and will help to inform planning future prevention and treatment strategies in low_risk populations."

Our aim was to investigate the additive effect of exercise and BS on cardiometabolic health. Method(s): Sixty-two patients with obesity (43.8+/-10.6years; 45.2+/-5.6Kg.m-2; 86% female) were recruited and one-month after BS (68% RYGB; 32% Sleeve) were randomized to control (CON, n=23; standard medical care) or exercise groups (EX, n=39; 11-months multicomponent exercise, 75min/day; 3day/week, plus standard medical care). Hemogram and biochemistry (liver enzymes, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, fasting glucose, HbA1c, insulin, C-peptide, uric acid and hs-CRP) were analyzed before, 6 and 12-months after BS and clinical assessment (weight, blood pressure, waist circumference and resting heart rate) was performed at 1, 6 and 12-months after surgery. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Result(s): 12-months after BS both groups decreased significantly body weight (CON -29%, EX -30%), waist circumference (CON -21%, EX -23%), insulin (CON -68%, EX -80%), c-peptide (CON -53%, EX -52%), glucose (CON -25%, EX -19%), HbA1c (CON -15%, EX -9%), triglycerides (CON -38%, EX -34%), uric acid (CON -29%, EX -13%) and leucocyte count (CON 22%, EX 20%). Significant decreases in total cholesterol (-24%), LDL (-32%) diastolic blood pressure (-12%) and Framingham score for CHD (-84%) were only observed in CON. Significant decreases in hs-CRP were only identified in EX (-83%). Two-way ANOVA showed no significant treatment*time interaction effect for any of the variables.

Goldfine	Bariatric surgery for diabetes management	2009	https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MED.0b013e32832912e7		"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the role of bariatric surgery in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes., RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple studies demonstrate that bariatric surgical approaches to obesity lead to substantial and sustained weight loss. Patients with diabetes have remission of hyperglycemia or require reduced medications. Surgical intervention for patients with more recent diabetes onset may have higher rates of resolution than patients with longer duration disease. In addition, dyslipidemia and hypertension improve. A short-term randomized clinical trial comparing laparoscopic banding with optimal medical management suggests surgery leads to more improvement in multiple metabolic measures. Perioperative risk is low and observational studies suggest long-term survival is favorable for obese patients following bariatric surgery. Metabolic risks of bariatric procedures are reviewed., SUMMARY: Although there are several surgical approaches for weight management, improvements in diabetes, including achievement of near normal glycemia without medication or reduced medications, are realized in many patients. Early surgical intervention for overweight type 2 diabetes may be clinically appropriate in patients for in whom operative risks are acceptable."

C. Fraser and G. T. Plant	The syndrome of pseudotumour cerebri and idiopathic intracranial hypertension	2011	https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/WCO.0b013e328341f94a		"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition in which raised intracranial pressure is associated with a high body mass index, and in those societies in which the prevalence of obesity is increasing the disorder is of increasing importance. It is one cause of the syndrome of pseudotumour cerebri but the cause and the link with a rise in body weight are not understood. Furthermore the treatment of the more severe, sight-threatening cases is controversial., RECENT FINDINGS: A major theme in recent years has been an attempt to identify the underlying mechanism of IIH. Some theories - such as the dural sinus stenosis theory - seem to ignore the relationship with weight gain; others have proposed a direct link between obesity and raised intracranial pressure through a specific fat distribution in the body; others through the production of lipokines; and yet others have suggested a converse causation with raised intracranial pressure giving rise to obesity. Uncontrolled case series continue to demonstrate the success of interventions such as cerebrospinal fluid diversion procedures, venous sinus stenting and bariatric surgery but there are no level 1 clinical trials., SUMMARY: Interest in IIH is increasing and currently generating numerous studies but there is no consensus view on either cause or management."

Sixty morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic adjustable gastric bandage (LAGB) were randomly assigned to receive anesthesia with sevoflurane titrated by either standard clinical parameters (SCP) (target = baseline hemodynamic parameters +/- 20%) or by A-line ARX index (AAI) (target = 20 +/- 5). Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, inspiratory and expiratory gas concentrations, and AAI were recorded in all patients at 5-min intervals, but AAI was made available only to the anesthesiologist assigned to AAI-monitored patients. Emergence times in surgery room and recovery times in postanesthesia care unit (PACU) were recorded at 1- and 30-min intervals. Mean intraoperative values of AAI were higher in AAI-monitored than in SCP-monitored patients (22.5 vs 15.0, p = 0.001). Compared to SCP monitoring, AAI monitoring reduced consumption of sevoflurane by 20% (p = 0.014), times to eye opening by 2.4 min (p = 0.001) and to extubation by 2.5 min (p = 0.009) and to achieve SpO(2) 92% in room air by 17 min (p = 0.001). Aldrete scores were higher in AAI- than in SCP-monitored patients at arrival in PACU (p = 0.035), but Aldrete scores >= 9 were attained in similar times. AAI monitoring can improve titration of and recovery from sevoflurane for LAGB."

Obesity is a major risk factor for DKD due to its causal relationship with diabetes, hypertension, and other factors promoting kidney disease. We therefore investigated whether metabolic surgery such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is more effective than state-of-the-art medical therapy (i.e., renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors, and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists) in treating DKD., DESIGN AND METHODS: In a post hoc analysis of the Microvascular Outcomes after Metabolic Surgery trial, we compared the likelihood of regression of microalbuminuria as the primary endpoint and other renal and metabolic secondary endpoints in a population of patients with obesity, type 2 diabetes, microalbuminuria, and early chronic kidney disease followed for 24 months. Nine patients underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and 24 patients were on state-of-the-art medical therapy., RESULTS: The gastric bypass arm had a significantly higher rate of regression of microalbuminuria (P < .001), borderline significant reduction in mean urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (P = .055), and much greater weight loss (P = .001). There were no statistically significant differences between arms in estimated glomerular filtration rate, risk of developing estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 over 5 years, mean hemoglobin A1c, systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or the American Diabetes Association triple endpoint., CONCLUSION: We found that metabolic surgery offers more kidney protection than state-of-the-art triple therapy for DKD at 24 months. Prospective studies in this area are necessary to better define the benefits and risks of medical versus surgical treatment of DKD. Copyright © 2022 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

Patients undergoing RYGBP were routinely screened for cholelithiasis by ultrasound. Patients who did not have cholecystectomy were managed with ursodiol for 6 months postoperatively., RESULTS: 13 males (9.0%) and 131 females (91%) underwent RYGBP. The mean age was 43 years (SD 8.55), and mean BMI was 46 kg/m2 (SD 6.5). The comorbidities of our patient population included diabetes (14%), hypertension (48%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (50%), dyslipidemia (35%), obstructive sleep apnea (31%), and musculoskeletal complaints (69%). 22 patients were diagnosed with cholelithiasis by ultrasonography preoperatively. 9 of these patients (41%) were symptomatic and underwent concurrent cholecystectomy and RYGBP. The remaining 13 patients (59%) had asymptomatic cholelithiasis preoperatively but did not undergo cholecystectomy at the time of surgery. Only one of these asymptomatic patients eventually developed symptoms necessitating cholecystectomy at up to 1 year follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that it may not be absolutely indicated to perform prophylactic cholecystectomy at the time of RYGBP surgery for asymptomatic cholelithiasis. We believe that this phenomenon needs to be further studied in a randomized trial."

Weight loss is associated with OSA severity improvement. In this scenario, bariatric surgery may be an effective therapy for OSA in obese patients. Previous evidence (most observational) is limited by short_term analysis in obese grade 3. Here, we hypothesized that Roux_en_Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery has a long_term effect in the OSA severity in obese grade 1 or 2 patients. Aim: Here, we hypothesized that Roux_en_Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery has a long_term effect in the OSA severity in obese grade 1 or 2 patients and we aim to verify this hypothesisMethods: This is a sub analysis of the GATEWAY study (Schiavon et al. Circulation 2018), a randomized controlled clinical trial addressing the impact of RYGB on blood pressure (BP) control in obese patients with body mass index (BMI) <40Kg/m2; Patients were randomly allocated to receive either RYGB plus optimized clinical treatment (OCT) or OCT treatment alone. During the ongoing trial, a subsample of patients was invited to perform portable sleep monitoring (Embletta GoldTM) before and after 3 years follow_up. OSA was defned in mild (apnea_hypopnea_index, AHI 5_14.9 events/h), moderate (15_29.9 events/h) and severe (ä´30 events/h) forms. We also evaluated excessive daytime sleepiness (>10 points) by Epworth Sleepiness Scale. All analyses were performed in a blinded fashion. Results: A total of 37 patients (n=24 allocated in the RYGB group and n=13 in the OCT group) were studied in this sub_analysis (83.7% female, mean age: 42å±8 years and BMI: 36.7 (35.8_38.5) Kg/m2. Compared to the OTC group, RYGB presented a signifcant decrease in BMI (1.7 (_1.9 to 2.7 vs _10.6 (_12.7 to _9.2 ) Kg/m2; p< 0.001), neck circumference (_ 1.5 (_2.5 to 2) vs. _7.5 (_10.5 to _4.8 cm; p< 0.001), waist circumference (3 (_3 to 9) vs. _ 25 (_30.8 to _20) cm; p< 0.001) and AHI (5 (_4.2 to 12.7) vs. _13.2 (_22.7 to _7) events/h; p=0.001). The frequency of moderate to severe OSA (AHI (ä´15 events/h) at baseline was 62.5% in the RYGB group vs. 46.2% in the OCT group; p=0.175. After the procedure, only 8.3% has moderate OSA (none with severe OSA) in the RYGB group vs 69.3% in the OCT group; p< 0.001. Consistently, the frequency of excessive daytime sleepiness did not showed signifcantly differences at baseline but lower rate in the RYGB group (20.8 vs. 69.2%); p< 0.006 . Conclusions: In this sub analysis from Gateway study, bariatric surgery is an effective strategy for decrease longterm OSA severity in patients with obesity grade 1 or 2."

This study reports the investigator-reported resolution or improvement of OSA and improvements in sleep-related quality of life (QOL) 2 years after surgical placement of the LAP-BAND AP * (LBAP) system., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The LBAP Experience (APEX) study is an ongoing 5 year, prospective, observational study assessing change in weight, comorbidities, and QOL after LBAP implantation. This is an interim analysis of patients with evaluable data at 24 months who had OSA at baseline., CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00501085., RESULTS: At baseline, 117 of 395 patients (29.6%; mean body mass index [BMI], 45.0 kg/m2) reported OSA; of these, 57 had evaluable patient-reported outcome data at 2 years. Investigator-reported resolution or improvement of OSA was 69% and 86% at post-operative years 1 and 2, respectively. Patients reporting resolution, improvement, or no change in OSA experienced mean changes in BMI and percentage of weight loss of -9.7 kg/m(2)/-21.7%, -8.3 kg/m(2)/-18.7%, and -5.7 kg/m(2)/-13.2%, respectively (n = 54). Mean 2 year BMI was not statistically different between the groups (p = not significant). Mean scores for all Epworth Sleepiness Scale responses for the OSA population improved by -0.43 from baseline (p < 0.0001; n = 78) compared with -0.29 for patients without OSA at baseline (n = 177; p = 0.037 between groups). In addition, the overall study population experienced resolution and/or improvement in other obesity-related comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes (96%) and hypertension (91%)., CONCLUSIONS: These data support that surgically facilitated weight loss can improve sleep-related QOL and may result in resolution or improvement of OSA; the degree of weight loss may be related to these changes."

Inadequate inclusion of racial and ethnic minorities and men, and high dropout rates in clinical trials limit generalizability of these findings to clinical practice. Weight loss achieved with antiobesity drugs is generally associated with lowered glycemia, but improvements in blood pressure and lipid measures tend to be marginal. There is limited evidence for sustained weight loss beyond 1 year and for safety and efficacy of antiobesity drugs in children and adolescents, and in post-bariatric surgery patients. None have demonstrated reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events or other significant disease outcomes. Limited health insurance coverage and negative perceptions of physicians have hindered the utilization of antiobesity drugs."

History and Systematic Review With Meta-Analyses	2021	https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.665023		"Mexicans and Mexican Americans share culture, genetic background, and predisposition for chronic complications associated with obesity and diabetes making imperative efficacious treatments and prevention. Obesity has been treated for centuries focused-on weight loss while other treatments on associated conditions like gout, diabetes (T2D), and hypertriglyceridemia. To date, there is no systematic review that synthesizes the origin of obesity clinics in Mexico and the efforts to investigate treatments for obesity tested by randomized clinical trials (RCT). We conducted systematic searches in Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science to retrieve anti-obesity RCT through 2019 and without an inferior temporal limit. The systematic review included RCT of anti-obesity treatments in the Mexican adult population, covering alternative medicine, pharmacological, nutritional, behavioral, and surgical interventions reporting metabolism-associated traits such as BMI, weight, waist circumference, triglycerides, glucose, among others. Only the studies with at least 3 months of treatment were included in the meta-analyses in order to reduce placebo effects. We found 634 entries, after removal of duplicates and screening the studies based on eligibility criteria, we analyzed 43 national, and 2 multinational-collaborative studies. Most of the national studies had small sample sizes, and the implemented strategies do not have replications in the population. The nutrition/behavioral interventions were difficult to blind, and most studies have medium-to-high risk of bias. Nutritional/behavioral interventions and medications showed effects on BMI, waist circumference, and blood pressure. Simple measures like pure water instead of sweet beverages decrease triglycerides and systolic blood pressure. Dark chocolate showed the highest effect for BMI and high blood pressure, and treatment with insulin increased weight in those with T2D. The study of obesity in Mexico has been on-going for more than four decades, the interest on RCT just increased until this millennium, but with small sample sizes and lack of replication. The interventions affect different cardiometabolic associated traits, which should be analyzed in detail in the population living near the Mexico-U.S. border; therefore, bi-national collaboration is desirable to disentangle the cultural effects on this population's treatment response.

There were 133 (83.1%) statements based on strong (best evidence level [BEL] 1 = 79 [49.4%]) or intermediate (BEL 2 = 54 [33.7%]) levels of scientific substantiation. There were 34 (23.6%) evidence-based recommendation grades (Grades A-C = 144) that were adjusted based on subjective factors.

In order to minimize the risk of opioid-induced postoperative respiratory failure, the intraoperative administration of opioids should be reduced or replaced with other drugs. The purpose of this study was to compare haemodynamic response elicited by intubation in morbidly obese patients between two variants of anaesthesia induction: fentanylbased or low-opioid using dexmedetomidine., METHODS: Forty-two morbidly obese patients scheduled for bariatric surgery were randomly assigned to two groups: low-opioid using dexmedetomidine (DEX) or fentanyl-based (FNT) anaesthesia. Patients were premedicated with 100 mug of fentanyl i.v. In the DEX group, a 10 minute infusion of a loading dose of 200 mug of dexmedetomidine was started. In the FNT group, 2 mg of intravenous midazolam was given. Thereafter, propofol was used in both groups. In the FNT group, patients received a dose of fentanyl up to 5 mug kg-1 of ideal body weight. Following administration of rocuronium, laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation were performed. Haemodynamic parameters, including systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP) and mean arterial (MAP) blood pressure, as well as heart rate (HR), were recorded before and after intubation. Patients who were not intubated at first attempt were excluded from the study., RESULTS: Data from 33 patients were analysed. There were no statistically significant differences between the DEX and FNT groups regarding demographic data. Haemodynamic response to intubation was defined as mean change (d) in values of analysed parameters that occurred during intubation. The following differences were observed: dSBP FNT +11.6 mm Hg vs. DEX +0.4 mm Hg (P = 0.15); dDBP FNT +3.7 mm Hg vs. DEX +3.5 mm Hg (P = 0.98); dMAP FNT +8.6 mm Hg vs. DEX +1.4 mm Hg (P = 0.36); dHR FNT +2 beats min-1 vs. DEX -1 beat min-1 (P = 0.30). None of these comparisons yielded significant differences., CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed no advantage of fentanyl over low opioid dexmedetomidine-based induction of general anaesthesia in attenuating cardiovascular response to intubation in morbidly obese patients."

Twelve patients accepted to be operated and presented the full eligibility criteria for surgery that includes overweight BMI (25-29.9 kg/m2), T2DM diagnosis for less than 15 years, insulin-treated patients, no history of major complications, preserved beta-cell function, and absence of autoimmunity. A matched control group (CG) of patients whom refused surgical treatment was placed to receive standard care. Patients had age of 50 (5) years, time of diagnosis 9 years (range, 3 to 15 years), time of insulin usage 6 months (range, 3 to 48 months), fasting glucose (FG), 9.8 (2.5) mg/dL, and glycated hemoglobin (A1C) 8.90 (2.12)%., RESULTS: At 24 weeks after surgery, patients experienced greater reductions on FG (14% vs. 7% on CG), A1C (from 8.78 to 7.84 in GJB-p<0.01 and 8.93 to 8.71 in CG; p<0.05 between groups) and reductions on average daily insulin requirement (93% vs. 29%, p<0.01). Ten patients stopped insulin usage in GJB but they remain taking oral medications. No differences were observed in both groups regarding BMI, body distribution and composition, blood pressure, and lipids., CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, duodenal-jejunal exclusion was an effective treatment for nonobese T2DM subjects. GJB was superior to standard care in achieving better glycemic control along with reduction in insulin requirements."

A new procedure has been proposed to overcome many of these limitations: laparoscopic vertical clip gastroplasty (LVCG) with BariClip., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty patients were offered LVCG and enrolled for a feasibility study in two referral bariatric centers. Indication was given as for sleeve gastrectomy, after a multidisciplinary path evaluating age, gender, BMI, comorbidities, eating behaviors, and gastroesophageal reflux. The primary outcome was major postoperative complications. Secondary outcomes included weight loss, incidence of de-novo GERD, and comorbidity resolution., RESULTS: Patients had a mean age of 44 years and mean BMI of 37 kg/m2 +/- 6.2. All procedures were performed successfully in laparoscopy, with no conversion or intraoperative adverse events. The overall major postoperative complication rate was 6%. Re-operation was required in three patients for slippage. No mortality occurred. Excess weight loss, excess BMI loss, and total weight loss at 6 months were 36%, 57%, and 22%, respectively. There was no instance of de-novo GERD. Resolution of hypertension occurred in 50% of cases, OSAS in 65% of cases, and DMII in 80% of cases., CONCLUSION: The safety of LVCG procedure has been reproduced in a multicentric, multi-surgeon study. Weight loss outcomes appear promising. A randomized trial is needed to fully assess the benefits of LVCG. Copyright © 2022.

METHODS: Randomization to either RV_PA conduit or BT shunt was stratified by surgeon and the presence of aortic atresia. The designated procedure was performed by using hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass with phenoxybenzamine, continuous cerebral perfusion, pH_stat blood gas management, and continuous postoperative venous oximetry. Differences between treatments were analyzed by time_series generalized least_squares regression, chi2 tests, two_way repeated measures analysis of variance, and the Levene variance ratio test for variability in parameters, as appropriate. RESULTS: All patients underwent the procedure to which they were randomized. There were no differences in age, weight, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, or cardiopulmonary bypass times between patients receiving the BT shunt (n = 8) or the RV_PA conduit (n = 9). There was one early and one late death in the RV_PA conduit group, and one interstage death in the BT shunt group. Other than diastolic blood pressure (39 mm Hg in BT shunt versus 46 mm Hg in RV_PA conduit, p < 0.001), there were no differences in the mean values of arterial saturation, venous oximetry, mean arterial blood pressure, pulmonary_to_systemic flow ratio (Qp/Qs), or any other physiologic or inotropic support variable between groups. The variability of physiologic values related to pulmonary blood flow was greater in the RV_PA group (Qp/Qs coefficient of variation, 0.91 versus 2.50, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized prospective study, no hemodynamic benefits of the RV_PA modification for stage 1 palliation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome were found. Pulmonary blood flow was more variable, and the diastolic blood pressure was higher. These findings did not influence indicators of systemic oxygen delivery with our afterload reduction strategy."

Individuals with ID may find nutritional guidelines difficult to follow and many face personal and environmental barriers for physical activity. Bariatric surgery may reduce obesity related health comorbidities while promoting sustained weight loss in diverse populations. Yet no study has reviewed the feasibility of conducting bariatric surgery on individuals with ID. Objectives To conduct a scoping review of literature on bariatric procedures performed on individuals with ID. Methods Authors searched electronic database via PubMED, Science Direct, Wiley and Medline (1975-2014). Extracted articles were evaluated independently following scoping reviews guidelines. Results Reviewers included sixteen studies. Nine surgical interventions were reported on 49 patients with ID. Studies followed either case report or case series design. The most common procedure patients received was biliopancreatic diversion (n = 24) followed by Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (n = 12). Degree of weight loss was the primary outcome in each study. Excess weight loss (%EWL) ranged from 12% to 86%. Further benefits included improved quality of life, decreased psychological tension within family and resolution of sleep apnea, hypertension, respiratory distress and type II diabetes. Six studies included a post-operative follow-up period below two years. Conclusions Bariatric surgery may be a viable option to treat obesity in individuals with ID but there is no consensus which procedure is preferred and which associated interventions should be in place to warrant long lasting results.

Delta changes (9 months after surgery-baseline) in clustered cardiometabolic risk (i.e., blood pressure index, fasting glucose, high-density lipoprotein [HDL] and triglycerides [TG]), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were calculated., RESULTS: A total of 42 patients who had complete bodyweight data (age = 40 +/- 8 year; BMI = 47.8 +/- 7.1 kg/m2) were included. Surgery led to substantial weight loss (-37.9 +/- 11.3 kg, P < 0,001), and clinically significant improvements in blood pressure index (-17.7 +/- 8.2 mmHg, P < 0.001), fasting glucose (-36.6 +/- 52.5 mg/dL, P < 0.001), HDL (9.4 +/- 7.1 mg/dL, P < 0.001), TG (-35.8 +/- 44.1 mg/dL P < 0,001), HbA1c (-1.2 +/- 1.6%, P < 0.001), HOMA-IR (-4.7 +/- 3.9 mg/dL, P < 0.001) and CRP (-8.5 +/- 6.7 mug/mL P < 0.001). Comparisons across tertiles revealed no differences for cardiometabolic risk score, fasting glucose, HbAc1, HOMA-IR, blood pressure index, CRP, HDL, and TG (P > 0.05 for all). Individual variable analysis confirmed cardiometabolic improvements across the spectrum on weight-loss. There were no associations between weight loss and any dependent variable., CONCLUSION: Weight loss following bariatric surgery does not correlate with improvements in cardiovascular risk factors. These findings suggest that weight loss alone may be insufficient to assess the cardiometabolic success of bariatric surgery, and the search for alternate proxies that better predict surgery success are needed.

(Poly)phenols may play a relevant role in the management of this disease modulating physiological and molecular pathways involved in energy metabolism and adiposity. The purpose of this double_blinded, placebo_controlled, randomised trial is to determine if (poly)phenol supplementation, in combination with a dietary intervention, can improve anthropometric and cardiometabolic parameters in participants with morbid obesity. Methods: Adults (n = 40) with morbid obesity, bariatric surgery candidates, will be recruited from the Bellvitge University Hospital, Spain, and randomly assigned (stratified by sex) to intervention (poly)phenol_rich supplement 1,200 mg/day + hypocaloric diet) or control group (placebo + hypocaloric diet) for 12 weeks. The primary outcome is body weight. Secondary outcomes are: other anthropometric markers and body composition measured through standardized methods and a bioimpedance analysis, cardiometabolic and inflammatory biomarkers, metabolic pathways, and gut microbiota diversity. Anthropometric parameters, dietary, physical activity and lifestyle questionnaires, blood pressure, and blood and urine samples will be collected at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. Faecal samples will be collected at baseline and at 12 weeks. Informed consent of participants will be obtained before the start of the study. Discussion: The present study is expected to provide evidence on the effects of a combination of (poly)phenols on several well_established obesity and cardiometabolic markers, and to unravel possible underlying mechanisms by metabolomic analyses. Gut microbiota diversity will be considered as a potential future endpoint. The study will contribute to future strategies for prevention or treatment of obesity and related conditions."

Methods: Parallel randomized trial comparing the effect of a very low calorie diet (VLCD) and a low calorie diet (LCD) for a period of 21 days before surgery on hepatic volume, anthropometric and biochemical parameters. Compliance and tolerance to the diets, surgical complications, and hospital stay were also determined. Results: Eighty_six morbid obese participants undergoing bariatric surgery were randomized. The hepatic volume was significantly reduced in both intervention groups, but no differences in changes between groups were detected. The reduction in the hepatic volume was higher in those patients with a baseline hepatic volume > 3 L compared to those with < 3 L (adjusted P value < 0.001). The percentages of total weight lost were 5.8 and 4.2% (adjusted P value = 0.004) for participants on the VLCD and LCD, respectively. There were no differences between groups for any of the biochemical parameters analyzed, nor in the number of surgical complications nor the length of hospital stay. Adherence to the diet was good; nevertheless, participants in the VLCD intervention showed worse tolerance. Conclusions: In subjects with morbid obesity undergoing bariatric surgery, compared to a LCD, a preoperative 21_day intervention with VLCD is more effective in terms of reducing total body weight but not in terms of reducing the liver volume. Both types of preoperative diets have similar effects on clinical biochemical parameters, rate of surgical complications, and hospital length stay."
M. Giri	Medical management of obesity	2006	https://dx.doi.org/10.1179/acb.2006.048		"The prevalence of obesity and obesity-related disorders, such as insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia, which form the basis for the Metabolic Syndrome, is still increasing and reaching epidemic proportions. Excess weight, particularly abdominal obesity, elevates multiple cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors, including Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, appropriate management of obesity and prevention of obesity-related diseases with high mortality and morbidity is of great importance for public health. Obesity management goals should encompass health improvement and cardiometabolic risk reduction as well as weight loss. Results of treatment of obesity with non-surgical interventions have been disappointing to date. However, recent data from large-scale studies indicate that only a moderate weight loss is sufficient to provide substantial health benefits. While lifestyle and diet modification form the basis of all effective strategies for weight reduction, some individuals may need additional intervention. This review focuses on the non-surgical treatment for obesity in particular lifestyle modifications and on appropriate use of pharmacotherapy for obesity and cardiometabolic risk."
"D. Giugliano, A. Ceriello and K. Esposito"	Are there specific treatments for the metabolic syndrome?	2008			"The concept of the metabolic syndrome, although controversial, continues to gain acceptance. Whereas each risk factor of the metabolic syndrome (visceral obesity, atherogenetic dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure, and dysglycemia) can be dealt with individually, the recommended initial therapeutic approach is to focus on reversing its root causes of atherogenetic diet, sedentary lifestyle, and overweight or obesity. No single diet is currently recommended for patients with the metabolic syndrome, although epidemiologic evidence suggests a lower prevalence of the metabolic syndrome associated with dietary patterns rich in fruit, vegetables, whole grains, dairy products, and unsaturated fats. We conducted a literature search to identify clinical trials specifically dealing with the resolution of the metabolic syndrome by lifestyle, drugs, or obesity surgery. Criteria used for study selection were English language, randomized trials with a placebo or control group (except for surgery), a follow-up lasting>or=6 mo, and a time frame of 5 y. We identified 3 studies based on lifestyle interventions, 5 studies based on drug therapy, and 3 studies based on laparoscopic weight-reduction surgery The striking resolution of the metabolic syndrome with weight-reduction surgery (93%) as compared with lifestyle (25%) and drugs (19%) strongly suggests that obesity is the driving force for the occurrence of this condition. Although there is no ""all-inclusive"" diet yet, it seems plausible that a Mediterranean-style diet has most of the desired attributes, including a lower content of refined carbohydrates, a high content of fiber, a moderate content of fat (mostly unsaturated), and a moderate-to-high content of vegetable proteins."

It is nowadays recognized as the most frequent liver disease, affecting a quarter of global population and regularly coexisting with metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. In a more simplistic view, NAFLD could be defined as an increase in liver fat content, in the absence of secondary cause of steatosis. In fact, the clinical onset of the disease is a much more complex process, closely related to insulin resistance, limited expandability and dysfunctionality of adipose tissue. A fatty liver is a main driver for a new recognized liver-pancreatic alpha-cell axis and increased glucagon, contributing to diabetes pathophysiology. Main text: This review will focus on the clinical and pathophysiological connections between NAFLD, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. We reviewed non-invasive methods and several scoring systems for estimative of steatosis and fibrosis, proposing a multistep process for NAFLD evaluation. We will also discuss treatment options with a more comprehensive view, focusing on the current available therapies for obesity and/or type 2 diabetes that impact each stage of NAFLD. Conclusion(s): The proper understanding of NAFLD spectrum - as a continuum from obesity to metabolic syndrome and diabetes - may contribute to the early identification and for establishment of targeted treatment.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)."

Participants were 130 (37% African American) severely obese (class II or III) adult participants without diabetes recruited from the community., INTERVENTIONS: One-year intensive lifestyle intervention consisting of diet and physical activity. One group (initial physical activity) was randomized to diet and physical activity for the entire 12 months; the other group (delayed physical activity) had the identical dietary intervention but with physical activity delayed for 6 months., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in weight. Secondary outcomes were additional components comprising cardiometabolic risk, including waist circumference, abdominal adipose tissue, and hepatic fat content., RESULTS: Of 130 participants randomized, 101 (78%) completed the 12-month follow-up assessments. Although both intervention groups lost a significant amount of weight at 6 months, the initial-activity group lost significantly more weight in the first 6 months compared with the delayed-activity group (10.9 kg [95% confidence interval {CI}, 9.1-12.7] vs 8.2 kg [95% CI, 6.4-9.9], P = .02 for group x time interaction). Weight loss at 12 months, however, was similar in the 2 groups (12.1 kg [95% CI, 10.0-14.2] vs 9.9 kg [95% CI, 8.0-11.7], P = .25 for group x time interaction). Waist circumference, visceral abdominal fat, hepatic fat content, blood pressure, and insulin resistance were all reduced in both groups. The addition of physical activity promoted greater reductions in waist circumference and hepatic fat content., CONCLUSION: Among patients with severe obesity, a lifestyle intervention involving diet combined with initial or delayed initiation of physical activity resulted in clinically significant weight loss and favorable changes in cardiometabolic risk factors., TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00712127."

Reduced blood supply due to atherosclerosis was hypothesised to be a contributing cause., METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-centre cohort study including all patients with LRYGB surgery from 2010 through 2015. Data from multiple registries, medical records and a questionnaire were used. The risk of chronic abdominal pain was analysed using multivariate logistic regression., RESULTS: We included 787 patients. Among these, 177 (23%) patients were defined as having chronic abdominal pain. The median follow-up was 63 months. When investigating the impact of risk factors for atherosclerosis including dyslipidaemia, Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, smoking and cardiovascular co-morbidities, the ""atherosclerosis composite score"" was a significant risk factor (odds ratio = 1.22, 95% confidence interval: 1.02-1.45). In a multivariate model specifically investigating dyslipidaemia, the association with chronic abdominal pain was non-significant., CONCLUSIONS: In this exploratory study, development of chronic abdominal pain was significantly associated with risk factors for atherosclerosis, but the specific association with dyslipidaemia was non-significant., FUNDING: The study was supported by the Danish Medical Association's Research Foundation and the Edgar Schnohr Foundation., TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (No. REG-063-2017).

This study aimed to prospectively assess LAGB safety and effectiveness outcomes using the MIDBAND TM (MID, Dardilly, France)., METHODS: Between May 2005 and September 2006, 262 morbidly obese patients underwent primary gastric banding with pars flaccida technique in 13 French medical centers. Excess weight loss and change in body mass index (BMI, kilogram per square meter), percentage of patients with comorbidities, and obesity-related complications were recorded. Patients were followed at 6-month intervals for 3 years. A multivariable individual growth model was used to analyze weight change over time and determine potential predictors of weight loss., RESULTS: The majority of patients were female (n = 233, 89%), with mean age of 36.4 +/- 9.7 years. At 3 years, LAGB with MIDBAND resulted in significant decrease in mean BMI from 41.8 +/- 4.2 to 30.7 +/- 5.8 (p < 0.0001). Median excess weight loss and excess BMI loss were 61% and 68%, respectively. The prevalence of obesity-related comorbidities had significantly decreased from 71% to 15% (p < 0.0001). Complications were observed in 26 patients (10%); device-related complications occurred in 20 patients (8.2%), requiring band removal in 8 (3.3%), and port revision in 8 (3.3%). Individual growth analysis identified significant predictors of weight loss including the number of follow-up visits., CONCLUSION: Prospective outcomes demonstrate the safety and efficacy of gastric banding over time using the MIDBAND. Individual growth modeling demonstrated that postoperative weight loss is strongly related to the frequency and consistency of follow-up visits."

We used ketorolac in lieu of narcotics toward this goal and present our subjective and objective data in this study., METHODS: A total of 50 morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery were randomly assigned to 2 groups of 25 each. Group I received intravenous ketorolac perioperatively, which was continued 24 hours postoperatively. Group II received remifentanyl intraoperatively as a part of balanced anesthesia. Intraoperative hemodynamic stability was assessed based on blood pressure, pulse rate, and bispectral index score values. Postoperative pain intensity using a visual analogue scale, as well as the presence of nausea, vomiting, hypotension, or respiratory depression, were also recorded., RESULTS: Postoperative side effects, including pain, nausea, and vomiting; requirements for analgesics and antiemetic medications in the PACU; and the time spent in the PACU varied significantly between the 2 groups. Continued administration of ketorolac during the first 24 hours postoperatively led to improved patient satisfaction and more enthusiastic participation in respiratory physical therapy., CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative use of intravenous ketorolac up to 24 hours after laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery for morbid obesity helps provide a more stable intraoperative environment, earlier discharge from the PACU, and better outcome in this subset of patients."

The intervention emphasized moderate caloric reduction, the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, and physical activity. Blinded staff collected data at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months., RESULTS: Participants (men, N=56; women, N=144; mean age=47.2 years [SD=10.6]) were randomly assigned to usual care (N=96) or a 6-month weekly group intervention plus six monthly maintenance sessions (N=104). A total of 181 participants (90.5%) completed 6-month assessments, and 170 (85%) completed 12-month assessments, without differential attrition. Participants attended 14.5 of 24 sessions over 6 months. Intent-to-treat analyses revealed that intervention participants lost 4.4 kg more than control participants from baseline to 6 months (95% CI=-6.96 kg to -1.78 kg) and 2.6 kg more than control participants from baseline to 12 months (95% CI=-5.14 kg to -0.07 kg). At 12 months, fasting glucose levels in the control group had increased from 106.0 mg/dL to 109.5 mg/dL and decreased in the intervention group from 106.3 mg/dL to 100.4 mg/dL. No serious adverse events were study-related; medical hospitalizations were reduced in the intervention group (6.7%) compared with the control group (18.8%)., CONCLUSIONS: Individuals taking antipsychotic medications can lose weight and improve fasting glucose levels. Increasing reach of the intervention is an important future step."

Methods: Twenty_eight ASA class I_II children scheduled for elective laparoscopic surgery under general anesthesia of intravenous and inhalation were randomly divided into two groups by computing random numbersÕ generation. Group D (Dex + sevoflurane + remifentanil) received an infusion of Dex 1 µg/kg bolus for induction over minutes, and then a maintenance dose of Dex 0.01 µg/kg.min was administrated. Group P (propofol + sevoflurane + remifentanil) received an infusion of propofol 2 mg/kg bolus for induction, and then a maintenance dose of 100 µg/kg _ min was administrated. Cardiac function were recorded and analyzed by NICOM. The value of heart rate (HR), systolic arterial blood pressure (SABP), cardiac index (CI), cardiac output (CO) and stroke volume (SV) were compared between the two groups among following four time points: T1 is before induction, T2 is before artificial pneumoperitoneum, T3 is during artificial pneumoperitoneum, T4 is 15 minutes after artificial pneumoperitoneum. Results: There was no significantly difference between Group D and P except for HR at T2 and T3. All of the statistical values had no significant differences between two groups at T1 and T4 (P > 0.05). There were significant differences of HR at T2 and T3 in Group D. Conclusions: Compared with propofol, the combination of Dex in children undergoing laparoscopic surgery shows better inhibition on HR."

Although vasoactive drugs can increase effective filtration pressure, they may increase renal vascular resistance and reduce renal blood flow. The effect of methoxamine on renal function is not clear. Methods: After obtaining written informed consent, 180 elderly patients undergoing elective gastrointestinal tumor surgery were randomly allocated into two groups: M group (continuous infusion of methoxamine at 2 _g/kg/min) and N group (continuous infusion of normal saline). The patients' mean arterial pressure was maintained within 20% of baseline by a continuous infusion of methoxamine or normal saline. Maintenance fluid was kept at 5 mL/kg/h. According to Kidney disease improve global outcome (KDIGO) guidelines, creatinine was measured at 1, 2 and 7 days after operation, and urine volume at 6, 12 and 24 h after operation was measured to evaluate the occurrence of AKI. 162 patients were included in the final data analysis. Results: Significant differences in the incidence of postoperative Acute kidney injury (M group: 7.5%; N group: 18.3%; P < 0.05), the frequency of hypotension (M group: 1 [1_3]; N group: 3 [1_5]; P < 0.05), and the duration of intraoperative hypotension (M group: 2[0_10]; N group: 10 [5_16]; P < 0.05) were identified between the groups. Multivariate logistic regression analyses demonstrated that preoperative creatinine and the frequency of intraoperative hypotension were the common factors leading to the occurrence of postoperative AKI. The results of Cox multivariate analysis showed that age and AKI were independent risk factors for 30_day death. Conclusion: Compared with the intraoperative continuous infusion of placebo and methoxamine, continuous infusion of 2 _g/kg/min methoxamine reduced the incidence of postoperative AKI and other clinical complications in elderly patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery by raising blood pressure and improved the prognosis of patients.

Several studies provide evidence for an association between MAFLD and atherosclerosis and cardio-metabolic disorders, including CVDs such as coronary heart disease and stroke. Therefore, the combination of MAFLD/NASH is associated with vascular risk and CVD progression, but the underlying mechanisms linking MAFLD/NASH and CVD are still under investigation. Several underlying mechanisms may probably be involved, including hepatic/systemic insulin resistance, atherogenic dyslipidemia, hypertension, as well as pro-atherogenic, pro-coagulant, and pro-inflammatory mediators released from the steatotic/inflamed liver. MAFLD is strongly associated with insulin resistance, which is involved in its pathogenesis and progression to NASH. Insulin resistance is a major cardiovascular risk factor in subjects without diabetes. However, T2D has been considered the most common link between MAFLD/NASH and CVD. This review summarizes the evidence linking obesity with MAFLD, NASH, and CVD, considering the pathophysiological molecular mechanisms involved in these diseases. We also discuss the association of MAFLD and NASH with the development and progression of CVD, including structural and functional cardiac alterations, and pharmacological strategies to treat MAFLD/NASH and cardiovascular prevention.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

In practice, the utilization of weight loss drugs is influenced by various factors, including the cost of treatment. We conducted a retrospective, observational study to assess the effectiveness of liraglutide 3.0 mg and patients' persistence on treatment, in a real-world setting. Method(s): Data were extracted from de-identified electronic medical records from an obesity management clinic in Switzerland. Changes in body weight and blood pressure were evaluated in the full cohort (N = 277, 19% of whom had undergone bariatric surgery) and subgroups who were persistent on liraglutide 3.0 mg for at least 4 months (n = 236), 7 months (n = 159), or 12 months (n = 71). Result(s): Median persistence on liraglutide was 6.8 months. Median maximum dose received was 1.5 mg, and 13.7% of patients reached the maintenance dose of 3.0 mg. Mean 7-month weight change from baseline in the full cohort was -4.1 kg (95% confidence interval: -5.0, -3.2; p < 0.001; -4.2%). Weight change was -4.4 kg (-4.7%) in the >=4-month persistence subgroup at 4 months, -5.1 kg (-5.3%) in the >=7-month persistence subgroup at 7 months, and -7.5 kg (-7.1%) in the >=12-month persistence subgroup at 12 months (all p < 0.001). In the full cohort, 40% and 14% of patients lost >=5% and >10% of body weight at 7 months, respectively. Weight loss did not differ significantly according to history of bariatric surgery (p = 0.94). Diastolic blood pressure decreased (from 87.0 to 83.9 mm Hg at 7 months; p = 0.018), with no significant changes in systolic blood pressure. Approximately two-thirds of patients did not have health insurance that could cover the cost of liraglutide. Conclusion(s): In a real-world setting with low insurance coverage and with most patients not reaching the recommended maintenance dose of 3.0 mg, the use of liraglutide, in combination with diet and exercise, was associated with clinically meaningful weight loss.Copyright © 2021"

Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty has now emerged as another safe and effective treatment for obesity. However, data on comparative outcomes between these endoscopic bariatric procedures is limited. Method(s): We identified our retrospective cohort of patients who underwent endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty as the primary procedure for weight loss between November 2019 and 2021. A matched comparison cohort of patients who underwent intragastric balloon insertion in the USA was identified from the MBSA-QIP registry after 1:1 propensity score matching based on age, gender, and pre-operative BMI; with caliper width of 0.1 S.D. Only primary bariatric procedures were included; patients with prior foregut surgery and those with unavailable outcomes in the registry were excluded. Short term safety outcomes at 30 days and weight loss outcomes at 30 days were compared between cohorts. Multivariate binary logistic regression models (incorporating procedure type, age, pre-op BMI, gender, race, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, OSA, and diabetes) were constructed for the need for intervention and achievement of 5% Total Body Weight Loss (TBWL) in the unmatched cohorts to account for effect modification or mediation from unmatched co-variates. Result(s): A total of 84 patients identified in our institutional cohort who underwent ESG were matched 1:1 with the IGB cohort. Mean age of participants was 46.15 yrs and 46.99 yrs in the ESG and IGB cohort, respectively and most participants were female. There was no difference in mean age, gender and mean pre-op BMI in the two cohorts (Table 1). No mortality was seen in both groups. In the ESG cohort, one patient required re-intervention (therapeutic endoscopy for GI bleed). Higher need for reintervention (including endoscopy) was noted in the IGB cohort (p: <0.01). No difference was noted in the need for hospital admission or need for treatment for dehydration in the two cohorts (p>0.05). Within 30 days, two patients required revision of procedure in IGB cohort while none required revision in the ESG cohort. A higher proportion of patients achieved TBWL of >/= 5% in the ESG cohort: 73 (86.9%) vs 52 (61.9%), p<0.001 (Table 2). On multivariate analysis, ESG was independently associated with the achievement of 5% TBWL (OR: 4.9, 95% CI: 2.33-10.35); there was a trend towards a lower need for intervention, but it failed to reach statistical significance (p=0.056). Conclusion(s): ESG and IGB are both safe endoscopic bariatric procedures. However, we found a higher rate of 5% TBWL achievement and a lower risk of need for intervention after ESG as compared to IGB. Prospective randomized studies are needed to compare outcomes between endoscopic bariatric therapies and identify optimal candidates for each procedure.

Zamrazilova"	Very low energy diets: the past and presence	2017		CN-01470916	"Failure to achieve appropriate weight loss, particularly in severely obese patients, by traditional low calorie diets led to implementation of strict calorie restrictions in the weight management. Serious health hazards including sudden deaths associated with semi_starvation and the use of liquid protein diets in the past led to development of very low energy diets (VLEDs). VLEDs were prepared by using proteins of a high biological quality as that of milk or egg white. The whey protein represented the main source of supplied proteins in the frst Czechoslovak VLED (Redita) prepared in the late eighties. Currently used VLEDs are characterized by energy intake about 3500 kJ and provide an appropriate supply of proteins incl. all essential amino acids, minerals, vitamins and trace elements. Amount of fat is substantially reduced and is mainly represented by essential fatty acids. Daily supply of carbohydrate in VLEDs is reduced to 30_80 g. High protein intake and mild ketosis exert protein_sparing and satiating effects. The rapid weight loss, approximately 10 kg after one month of VLED administration, is mainly due to fat loss. In severely obese patients weight loss of 20_25 kg is observed after 4 months of VLED treatment. VLEDs are primarily indicated for weight management, particularly in severely obese, in whom weight loss before surgery is recommended or who cannot undergo bariatric surgery. In addition VLEDs have also been proved an efcient approach to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D), obstructive sleep apnea, arthritis, and non_alcoholic fatty liver disease. VLEDs rapidly reduce cardiometabolic health risks: improve lipid profle and glucose homeostasis, reduce blood pressure and visceral fat. Improvements in steroid profle and SHBG levels were observed after the treatment with Redita. Some VLEDs signifcantly reduce carbohydrate intake which leads to a more profound improvement in insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. VLEDs mimic the early benefcial effect of gastric bypass on insulin sensitivity and beta_cell function in T2D. Reversal of T2D in youth who adhered to a VLED was demonstrated. VLED_induced weight loss is associated with improved insulin signaling and with a decrease in intramyocellular lipid content. Replacement of 1_2 daily meals with portion/s of VLED is one of the most effective tools for weight loss maintenance. Look AHEAD trial conducted in overweight/obese patients with T2D clearly demonstrated that the degree of weight loss after 1 year of intensive lifestyle intervention was dependent on the number of daily consumed portions of VLED. effects of meal replacement (MR) are mostly due to the controlled energy content and to the high protein vs. low fat content. MR also contributes to a more appropriate intake of essential nutrients. Use of VLEDs both as a sole source of nutrition and as MR should be initiated by a physician who should take into account indications and contraindications in individual patients. VLEDs should be included into long_term weight management programs with diet, increased physical activity and cognitive behavioral intervention. During the follow_up dietitians or trained nurses/counselors may be responsible for the weight management while physicians might play only advisory role."

"Multistrain probiotic increases the gut microbiota diversity in obese pregnant women: results from a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study"	2020	10.1093/cdn/nzaa095	CN-02213321	"Background: Maternal obesity is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Probiotic supplementation during pregnancy may have positive effects on blood glucose, gestational weight gain (GWG), and the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus [GDM and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)]. Objectives: This feasibility study involved a daily probiotic intervention in obese pregnant women from the early second trimester until delivery. The primary aim was to investigate the effect on GWG and maternal glucose homeostasis (GDM and HbA1c). Secondary aims were the effect on infant birth weight, maternal gut microbiota, and other pregnancy outcomes. Methods: We carried out a randomized double_blinded placebo_controlled study in 50 obese pregnant women. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to multistrain probiotic (4 capsules of Vivomixx¨; total of 450 billion CFU/d) or placebo at 14_20 weeks of gestation until delivery. Participants were followed with 2 predelivery visits at gestational week 27_30 and 36_37 and with 1 postdelivery visit. All visits included blood and fecal sampling. An oral_glucose_Tolerance test was performed at inclusion and gestational week 27_30. Results: Forty_nine participants completed the study. Thirty_eight participants took >80% of the capsules (n = 21), placebo (n = 17). There was no significant difference in GWG, GDM, HbA1c concentrations, and infant birth weight between groups. Fecal microbiota analyses showed an overall increase in __diversity over time in the probiotic group only (P = 0.016). Conclusions: Administration of probiotics during pregnancy is feasible in obese women and the women were willing to participate in additional study visits and collection of fecal samples during pregnancy. Multistrain probiotic can modulate the gut microbiota in obese women during pregnancy. A larger study population is needed to uncover pregnancy effects after probiotic supplementation. This trial was registered at clincaltrials.gov as NCT02508844."

Obesity accounts for much of the risk for primary hypertension through several mechanisms, including neurohormonal activation, inflammation, and kidney dysfunction. As the prevalence of obesity continues to increase, hypertension and associated cardiorenal diseases will also increase unless more effective strategies to prevent and treat obesity are developed. Lifestyle modification, including diet, reduced sedentariness, and increased physical activity, is usually recommended for patients with obesity; however, the long-term success of these strategies for reducing adiposity, maintaining weight loss, and reducing blood pressure has been limited. Effective pharmacotherapeutic and procedural strategies, including metabolic surgeries, are additional options to treat obesity and prevent or attenuate obesity hypertension, target organ damage, and subsequent disease. Medications can be useful for short- and long-term obesity treatment; however, prescription of these drugs is limited. Metabolic surgery is effective for producing sustained weight loss and for treating hypertension and metabolic disorders in many patients with severe obesity. Unanswered questions remain related to the mechanisms of obesity-related diseases, long-term efficacy of different treatment and prevention strategies, and timing of these interventions to prevent obesity and hypertension-mediated target organ damage. Further investigation, including randomized controlled trials, is essential to addressing these questions, and emphasis should be placed on the prevention of obesity to reduce the burden of hypertensive cardiovascular and kidney diseases and subsequent mortality."

Participants included persons aged 21 to 65 years with type 2 diabetes diagnosed more than 1 year before the study; their body mass index was 30 to 42 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was greater than or equal to 6.5%. All participants were receiving antihyperglycemic medications., INTERVENTIONS: RYGB (n = 19) or Why WAIT (n = 19) including 12 weekly multidisciplinary group lifestyle, medical, and educational sessions with monthly follow-up thereafter., MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Proportion of patients with fasting plasma glucose levels less than 126 mg/dL and HbA1c less than 6.5%, measures of cardiometabolic health, and patient-reported outcomes., RESULTS: At 1 year, the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c below 6.5% and fasting glucose below 126 mg/dL was higher following RYGB than Why WAIT (58% vs 16%, respectively; P = .03). Other outcomes, including HbA1c, weight, waist circumference, fat mass, lean mass, blood pressure, and triglyceride levels, decreased and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased more after RYGB compared with Why WAIT. Improvement in cardiovascular risk scores was greater in the surgical group. At baseline the participants exhibited moderately low self-reported quality-of-life scores reflected by Short Form-36 total, physical health, and mental health, as well as high Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite and Problem Areas in Diabetes health status scores. At 1 year, improvements in Short Form-36 physical and mental health scores and Problem Areas in Diabetes scores did not differ significantly between groups. The Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite score improved more with RYGB and correlated with greater weight loss compared with Why WAIT., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In obese patients with type 2 diabetes, RYGB produces greater weight loss and sustained improvements in HbA1c and cardiometabolic risk factors compared with medical management, with emergent differences over 1 year. Both treatments improve general quality-of-life measures, but RYGB provides greater improvement in the effect of weight on quality of life. These differences may help inform therapeutic decisions for diabetes and weight loss strategies in obese patients with type 2 diabetes until larger randomized trials are performed., TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01073020."

Comparative effectiveness of cardiometabolic outcomes after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding vs. Intensive diabetes and weight management in obese patients with type 2 diabetes	2015		CN-01293810	"To compare effectiveness of bariatric surgery vs. intensive medical diabetes and weight management on cardiometabolic outcomes, we randomized 40 obese T2D (22 M / 18 F; age 51 ± 10 yrs; weight 109 ± 15 kg; BMI 36.5 ± 3.7 kg/m2; diabetes duration 9 ± 5 yrs; HbA1c 8.2 ± 1.2%; 40% on insulin) to laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB; n = 18) or intensive medical diabetes and weight management (IMWM; n = 22) with 12 months follow up. After 10% weight loss or 3 months (if 10% weight loss was not achieved), similar reductions in weight (_9.7 ± 0.8 vs. _9.2 ± 0.8 kg; LAGB vs IMWM) and fat mass by bioelectrical impedance (_8.0 ± 0.8 vs. _6.6 ± 0.8 kg) occurred. At 12 months, however, loss of weight (_13.5 ± 1.7 vs. _8.5 ± 1.6 kg, p < 0.05) and fat mass (_10.4 ± 1.3 vs. _6.7 ± 1.3 kg, p = 0.05) were greater post_LAGB. Total weight and fat mass loss were highly correlated in both groups (LAGB: r = 0.88, p < 0.001; IMWM: r = 0.73, p < 0.001). HbA1c reduction was similar post_LAGB vs. IMWM at both 3 months (_1.0 ± 0.3 vs. _1.7 ± 0.3%; p = 0.06) and 12 months (_1.2 ± 0.3 vs. _1.0 ± 0.3%). A pre_specified glycemic endpoint, defined as HbA1c < 6.5% and fasting glucose < 126 mg/dl at 12 months on or off medication, was achieved in 6 of 18 (33%) patients in the LAGB group and 5 of 19 (26%) in the IMWM group. At 12 months, reductions in systolic blood pressure (BP) were greater after IMWM vs LAGB (_5±2 vs 2±3, p = 0.05), with no differences in diastolic BP. Triglycerides decreased (_30 ± 16 vs. _43 ± 16 mg/dl) and HDL increased (8 ± 2 vs. 5 ± 2 mg/dl) in LAGB vs. IMWM, respectively, but without differences between groups. Change in LDL cholesterol trended lower in LAGB (_8 ± 6 vs. 5 ± 5 mg/dl; p = 0.09). Five_year risk of a coronary heart disease (CHD) event as determined by the UKPDS risk engine scores decreased from 10.5 ± 1.8% at baseline to 9.2 ± 2.1% at 12 months in the LAGB group (p < 0.05), and from 9.7 ± 1.7% to 9.0 ± 1.8% in the IMWM group (p = 0.11), with no significant difference between groups. Risk of a fatal CHD event also decreased from 6.5 ± 1.3% to 5.9 ± 1.5% in LAGB, and from 5.8 ± 1.1% to 5.5 ± 1.3% in IMWM, although these changes were not statistically significant. In summary, after 12 months of follow_up: 1) LAGB produces greater weight loss than an intensive diabetes and medical weight management program, 2) The total amount of weight loss is highly correlated with loss of fat mass in both groups, 3) Both LAGB and intensive medical management produce similar improvements in HbA1c and attainment of glycemic control, 4) Both groups had modest improvements in lipids and blood pressure, which were reflected in a moderate reduction in predicted CHD risk. These findings suggest that LAGB and an intensive diabetes and weight management program have many similar benefits on diabetes control and cardiometabolic risk factors, which should be discussed in the context of other factors such as personal preference or surgical eligibility when considering treatment options in obese type 2 diabetes patients."

To compare the effectiveness of this program vs. bariatric surgery, 40 obese patients with type 2 diabetes (22 M/18 F; weight 109+/_15 kg; BMI 36.5+/_3.7 kg/m2; age 51+/_10 years; A1C 8.2+/_1.2%) were randomized to Why WAIT (WW; n=22) or laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB; n=18). At 12 months, weight loss after LAGB was higher than after WW (_13.5+/_1.7 vs. _8.5+/_1.6 kg respectively, p< 0.05) however, A1C reduction was similar (_1.2+/_0.3 vs. _1.0+/_0.3%). The improvement in blood pressure, triglycerides, LDL were not different between the 2 groups. Five_year risk of a coronary heart disease event, as determined by the UKPDS risk engine scores, decreased from 9.7+/_1.7% to 9.0+/_1.8% after WW and from 10.5+/_1.8% to 9.2+/_2.1% after LAGB, with no significant difference between groups. Risk of fatal CHD events also decreased from 5.8+/_1.1% to 5.5+/_1.3% after WW and from 6.5+/_1.3% to 5.9+/_1.5% after LAGB, but these changes were not statistically significant. Quality of life (QOL) scores (SF_36 physical health, mental health) changed minimally from baseline with no difference between groups. The Impact of Weight on QOL and Problem Areas in Diabetes improved significantly from baseline in both WW and LAGB (p<0.01 for both), but the effects were similar between groups. These findings suggest that Why WAIT program and LAGB have similar benefits on diabetes control, cardiometabolic risk and QOL parameters. These results may be useful in guiding obese patients with type 2 diabetes when they explore their weight management options."

However, comparative analysis of their effectiveness has not been well studied. This comparative analysis was conducted to determine whether Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy have the same mid- and long-term outcomes in weight loss, resolution of obesity comorbidities and adverse events (AEs) of treatment., METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases from the establishment of the database to January 1, 2020 for both randomized control trials and non-randomised interventional studies that studied Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with respect to weight loss outcomes, resolution of obesity comorbidities and AEs of treatment. Standardised mean differences, risk ratios and odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals were calculated to compare the outcomes of the groups. Two reviewers assessed the quality of the trials and extracted the data independently. All statistical analyses were performed using the standard statistical procedures in Review Manager 5.2., RESULTS: We included 20 studies (N = 2917 participants) in this meta-analysis. Our results showed no significant difference in excess weight loss between Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, with pooled Standardised mean differences of -0.16 (95% confidence interval: -0.52 to 0.19; P = 0.36) based on randomized control trials and 0.07 (95% confidence interval: -0.10 to 0.24; P = 0.41) based on non-randomised interventional studies. Further, the pooled results showed no significant differences in midterm and long-term weight loss outcomes between the comparative groups. Similarly, no significant difference was found in type 2 diabetes mellitus resolution. The pooled results indicated that patients receiving laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy experienced fewer postoperative complication and reoperation rates, with pooled risk ratios of 1.66 (95% confidence interval: 1.33 to 2.07; P < 0.00001) and 1.73 (95% confidence interval: 1.14 to 2.62; P = 0.01), respectively. Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was superior to laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in managing dyslipidemia, hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease., CONCLUSIONS: The present meta-analysis indicated that both Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy had the same effectiveness in resulting in excess weight loss and type 2 diabetes mellitus resolution. However, patients who received laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy experienced fewer postoperative complication and reoperation rates than those who received Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was superior in the management of dyslipidemia, hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd."

The (dys)metabolic syndrome is a common cluster of five pre-morbid metabolic-vascular risk factors or diseases associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity, fatty liver disease and risk of cancer. The risk for major complications such as cardiovascular diseases, NASH and some cancers develops along a continuum of risk factors into clinical diseases. Therefore we still include hyperglycemia, visceral obesity, dyslipidemia and hypertension as diagnostic traits in the definition according to the term 'deadly quartet'. From the beginning elevated blood pressure and hyperglycemia were core traits of the metabolic syndrome associated with endothelial dysfunction and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Thus metabolic and vascular abnormalities are in extricable linked. Therefore it seems reasonable to extend the term to metabolic-vascular syndrome (MVS) to signal the clinical relevance and related risk of multimorbidity. This has important implications for integrated diagnostics and therapeutic approach. According to the definition of a syndrome the rapid global rise in the prevalence of all traits and comorbidities of the MVS is mainly caused by rapid changes in life-style and sociocultural transition resp. with over- and malnutrition, low physical activity and social stress as a common soil.Copyright © 2016, The Author(s)."

Both observational studies and clinical trials have shown metabolic surgery to result in sustained weight loss (20-30%), T2D remission rates ranging from 23% to 60%, and improvement in cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia. Metabolic surgery is cost-effective and relatively safe, with perioperative risks and mortality comparable to low-risk procedures such as cholecystectomy, hysterectomy, and appendectomy. International diabetes and medical organizations have endorsed metabolic surgery as a standard treatment for T2D with obesity."

Randomized, controlled trials of laparoscopic vs. open colectomy have shown equivalence but often exclude obese patients thus not answering whether obese patients may specifically benefit from laparoscopy. We hypothesized that obese patients would benefit from use of laparoscopy for colectomy., METHODS: We used the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from 2005 to 2009 and chose elective laparoscopic and open segmental colectomy and ileocecal resections. We compared patients' demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes. We used multivariate models to assess for predictors of complications in obese patients. These models included demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes., RESULTS: 35,998 patients were identified who underwent elective colectomy with primary anastomosis. Forty-four percent of the included cases were laparoscopic and 31 % of patients had a BMI greater than 30 (obese). Obese patients were more likely to have diabetes, hypertension, prior percutaneous coronary intervention, and dyspnea on exertion. We constructed a new variable called any complication that included all complications except 30-day mortality. In our multivariate analysis, laparoscopic approach in obese patients independently decreased the relative risk of superficial (odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.63-0.82) and deep (OR 0.44, CI 0.31-0.61) surgical site infections, intra-abdominal infection (OR 0.61, CI 0.49-0.78), dehiscence (OR 0.50, CI 0.35-0.69), pneumonia (OR 0.60, CI 0.44-0.81), failure to wean from the ventilator (OR 0.64, CI 0.47-0.87), renal failure (OR 0.58, CI 0.35-0.96), urinary tract infection (OR 0.62, CI 0.49-0.79), sepsis (OR 0.53, CI 0.43-0.66), septic shock (OR 0.65, CI 0.47-0.90), any complication (OR 0.61, CI 0.55-0.67) and 30-day mortality (OR 0.56, CI 0.31-0.98)., CONCLUSIONS: Due to the significant decrease in the risk of morbidity and mortality, laparoscopic colectomy should be offered to obese patients whenever feasible."

We sought to define the optimal timing of early screening by comparing testing results and outcomes by the gestational age at screening. Study Design: Secondary analysis of a multicenter randomized controlled trial of obese women with singleton non-anomalous gestations comparing early to routine screening for GDM. Women were excluded for pregestational diabetes, major medical illness, bariatric surgery, or primary cesarean. All screening was accomplished with the two-step method: women with 1-hr glucose challenge test (GCT) >=135 mg/dL underwent a 3-hr test with Carpenter-Coustan criteria for diagnosis. For this per protocol analysis, early screening was stratified into two-week blocks (14-15.9, 16-17.9, 18-18.9, and 20-21.9). Value of the GCT, proportion with GCT>=135 mg/dL, proportion with GDM, and incidence of the primary composite outcome (primary cesarean, macrosomia [>4000g], pregnancy induced hypertension, shoulder dystocia, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypoglycemia) were compared across strata. The composite outcome was compared between each early stratum and the routine screen group. Groups were compared with a chi-squared, chi-squared for trend, or Student's t-test as appropriate. Result(s): Of 857 women, 390 (45.5%) received screening between 14-21.9 weeks. Strata were similar in age, race, BMI, and HbA1c. Women screened earlier were more likely to have hypertension (p=0.03). GCT value, GDM diagnosis < 24 weeks, and gestational age at diagnosis of GDM did not change by timing of early screen (Table 1). Incidence of the primary outcome did not change by timing of early screen. No timing of early screening was associated with a decrease in the primary composite outcome compared to routine screening (Figure 1). Conclusion(s): Between 14-21.9 weeks, timing of early GDM screen did not impact screening and diagnosis values, nor did it impact the effect of treatment at current screening and diagnosis thresholds.

It is a clinically silent disease leading to multiple extra-hepatic complications/comorbidities. It is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), increasing susceptibility to hypertension, atherosclerosis, arrhythmia, myocardial dysfunction, cardiac valve deformation, and venous thrombosis through putative mechanisms including systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and altered lipid metabolism. Eventually, it increases the CVD prevalence, incident, and fatality, contributing to a huge health care burden. In fact, CVD is becoming the leading cause of mortality among patients with NAFLD. Other cardiometabolic risk factors coexisting with NAFLD may also accelerate the synergistic development of CVD, which warrants assessment targeting hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), obesity, and dyslipidemia to be an integral part of NAFLD care. Monitoring metabolic biomarkers (glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c], insulin, lipids, and lipoproteins), cardiovascular (CV) risk scores (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association [ACC/AHA] or Framingham), and subclinical atherosclerosis (coronary artery calcification [CAC], carotid intima-media thickness [CIMT], and carotid plaque) are recommended for risk prediction and reduction. There is no universally accepted treatment for NAFLD, and lifestyle changes with weight loss of at least 10% are the mainstay of management. Combination therapy of ezetimibe and statins have a cardioprotective effect and help reduce liver fat. Despite being an emerging risk factor for CVD and its rapidly increasing pattern affecting a quarter of the global population, NAFLD remains overlooked and undetected, unlike the other traditional risk factors. Hence, we conducted a comprehensive narrative review to shed more light on the importance of screening CVD in NAFLD patients. PubMed indexed relevant articles published from 2002 to 2022 (20 years) were searched in April 2022 using medical subject headings (MeSH) as ""nonalcoholic fatty liver disease"" [Mesh] AND ""cardiovascular diseases"" [Mesh]. Evidence from 40 observational studies, three clinical trials, one case series, 45 narrative reviews, four systematic reviews and meta-analyses, three systematic reviews, and one meta-analysis were summarized on the epidemiologic data, pathophysiologic mechanisms, clinical features, diagnostic modalities, overlapping management, perceived challenges and health literacy regarding the CVD risk attributed to NAFLD.

Levels of interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, leptin, adiponectin, glucose, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, as well as clinical characteristics, were evaluated before surgery and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. Results were compared between groups., RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were comparable in both groups. Mean operative time was significantly higher in the group of patients who underwent omentectomy (P < 0.001). Median weight of the omentum was 795 +/- 341 g. In one patient, a duodenal perforation occurred at the time of omentectomy. BMI, blood pressure, glucose, total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides significantly improved in both groups at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up when compared with basal values. However, there were no consistent statistically significant differences among the groups in terms of metabolic syndrome components, acute-phase reactants, and inflammatory mediators., CONCLUSIONS: Omentectomy does not have an ancillary short-term significant impact on the components of metabolic syndrome and does not induce important changes in the inflammatory mediators in patients undergoing LRYGB.

METHODS: The study was a 12_week randomised, placebo_controlled, double_blinded, parallel intervention trial. A total of 116 overweight or obese participants were assigned randomly either to 10 g inulin plus 10 g resistant maltodextrin or to 20 g of placebo supplementation through 400 mL of milk a day, while on a __500 kcal/day energy restricted diet. RESULTS: Altogether, 86 participants completed the intervention. There were no significant differences in weight loss or body composition between the groups. The fibre supplement reduced systolic (5.35_±_2.4 mmHg, p_=_0.043) and diastolic (2.82_±_1.3 mmHg, p_=_0.047) blood pressure to a larger extent than placebo. Furthermore, a larger decrease in serum insulin was observed in the placebo group compared to the fibre group (__26.0_±_9.2 pmol/L, p_=_0.006). The intake of fibre induced changes in the composition of gut microbiota resulting in higher abundances of Parabacteroides and Bifidobacteria, compared to placebo. The effects on blood pressure and glucose metabolism were mainly observed in women, and could be attributed to a higher gut microbiota diversity after intervention. Finally, the fibre group experienced a higher degree of gastrointestinal symptoms, which attenuated over time. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation of inulin and resistant maltodextrin did not provide an additional weight loss during an energy_restricted diet, but reduced both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Furthermore, the fibre supplement did stimulate the growth of potentially beneficial bacteria genera.

The treatment for obesity and its associated comorbidities has most recently expanded into the field of bariatric endoscopy. This field bridges a gap between lifestyle counseling with or without pharmaceutical treatment and the most effective treatment of obesity, bariatric surgery. Because of its minimally invasive nature, bariatric endoscopic therapy has the potential to appeal to the large sector of the obese population that resists surgery, as well as those early in the onset of obesity. To date, five endoscopic devices have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of obesity, and many more are in development, undergoing clinical trials, or being used around the world. Here, we present the current state of the field, highlight recent developments, and describe the clinical outcomes of these minimally invasive procedures in terms of weight loss, improvement in metabolic profile, and reduction in comorbidities.

J. Hoffmann and P. J. Goadsby	Update on intracranial hypertension and hypotension	2013	https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/WCO.0b013e328360eccc		"Purpose of Review: The aim of this article is to review recent findings on the pathophysiology of idiopathic changes in intracranial pressure. The review will focus on idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH). Recent Findings: Substantial evidence indicates that IIH is associated with delayed absorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Stenoses of the transverse sinus are common in IIH, but their clinical significance has not been entirely clarified. Despite the observed efficacy of endovascular treatment in some IIH patients, a correlation between the extent of observed stenoses and the clinical course of the disease could not be demonstrated. The underlying cause of SIH is a spontaneous CSF leakage into the epidural space. Conservative treatment and the epidural blood patch remain the treatment of choice for this rare syndrome. Summary: Recent clinical evidence indicates that IIH is probably a result of CSF outflow abnormality rather than of CSF production. Further research is needed to elucidate the causes of elevated intracranial pressure and the mechanism leading to visual loss. Prospective randomized clinical trials are needed to clarify a possible therapeutic potential of endovascular treatment. Research efforts on SIH should focus further on associated connective tissue disorders predisposing to CSF leaks. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

We aimed to compare the effect of bariatric surgery and comprehensive lifestyle intervention on type 2 diabetes and obesity-related cardiovascular risk factors., DESIGN: One-year controlled clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00273104)., METHODS: Morbidly obese subjects (19-66 years, mean (s.d.) body mass index 45.1 kg/m(2) (5.6), 103 women) were treated with either Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (n=80) or intensive lifestyle intervention at a rehabilitation centre (n=66). The dropout rate within both groups was 5%., RESULTS: Among the 76 completers in the surgery group and the 63 completers in the lifestyle group, mean (s.d.) 1-year weight loss was 30% (8) and 8% (9) respectively. Beneficial effects on glucose metabolism, blood pressure, lipids and low-grade inflammation were observed in both groups. Remission rates of type 2 diabetes and hypertension were significantly higher in the surgery group than the lifestyle intervention group; 70 vs 33%, P=0.027, and 49 vs 23%, P=0.016. The improvements in glycaemic control and blood pressure were mediated by weight reduction. The surgery group experienced a significantly greater reduction in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome, albuminuria and electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy than the lifestyle group. Gastrointestinal symptoms and symptomatic postprandial hypoglycaemia developed more frequently after gastric bypass surgery than after lifestyle intervention. There were no deaths., CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 diabetes and obesity-related cardiovascular risk factors were improved after both treatment strategies. However, the improvements were greatest in those patients treated with gastric bypass surgery."

Intake of microbially accessible dietary fibers (prebiotics) lead to varying effects on SCFA production in human studies, and gut microbial responses to nutritional interventions vary by individual. It is therefore possible that prebiotic therapies will require customizing to individuals. RESULTS: Here, we explored prebiotic personalization by conducting a three_way crossover study of three prebiotic treatments in healthy adults. We found that within individuals, metabolic responses were correlated across the three prebiotics. Individual identity, rather than prebiotic choice, was also the major determinant of SCFA response. Across individuals, prebiotic response was inversely related to basal fecal SCFA concentration, which, in turn, was associated with habitual fiber intake. Experimental measures of gut microbial SCFA production for each participant also negatively correlated with fiber consumption, supporting a model in which individuals' gut microbiota are limited in their overall capacity to produce fecal SCFAs from fiber. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support developing personalized prebiotic regimens that focus on selecting individuals who stand to benefit, and that such individuals are likely to be deficient in fiber intake.

Their mean body mass index (+/-SD) was 50 +/- 13 kg/m, and excess weight was 171 +/- 79 pounds. Comorbidities included depression (3 patients), sleep apnea (3), hypertension (6), dyslipidemia (7), insulin resistance (9), metabolic syndrome (9), and steatohepatitis (in 4 of 5 patients with liver biopsy). Operative time was 45 +/- 9 minutes, and discharges were within 23 hours of surgery. Band-related complications were as follows: 2 dehydration, 1 pouch dilation, and 1 port revision. All of the patients lost weight, with a 9-month excess weight loss of 30% +/- 16% (range 14%-57%). Hypertension and the metabolic syndrome were resolved in 100% of patients (P = 0.04) and 80% of the patients (P = 0.01), respectively, along with significant improvement in the Pediatric Quality of Life and Beck Depression Inventory scores and a trend toward improvement in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol abnormalities (P = 0.08)., CONCLUSIONS: At short-term follow-up, weight loss occurred with minimal complications, leading to early resolution of major obesity-related comorbidities. Continued evaluation of the long-term safety and efficacy of LAGB as a surgical adjunct to a comprehensive obesity treatment program is warranted."

Data analyses were performed from February to June 2021., EXPOSURES: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass., MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was discontinuation of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia medication for any reason. Among patients who discontinued medication, the adjusted cumulative incidence of restarting medication was calculated up to 5 years after discontinuation., RESULTS: Of the 95405 patients included, 71348 (74.8%) were women and the mean (SD) age was 56.6 (11.8) years. Gastric bypass compared with sleeve gastrectomy was associated with a slightly higher 5-year cumulative incidence of medication discontinuation among 30588 patients with diabetes medication use and diagnosis at the time of surgery (74.7% [95% CI, 74.6%-74.9%] vs 72.0% [95% CI, 71.8%-72.2%]), 52081 patients with antihypertensive medication use and diagnosis at the time of surgery (53.3% [95% CI, 53.2%-53.4%] vs 49.4% [95% CI, 49.3%-49.5%]), and 35055 patients with lipid-lowering medication use and diagnosis at the time of surgery (64.6% [95% CI, 64.5%-64.8%] vs 61.2% [95% CI, 61.1%-61.3%]). Among the subset of patients who discontinued medication, gastric bypass was also associated with a slightly lower incidence of medication restart up to 5 years after discontinuation. Specifically, the 5-year cumulative incidence of medication restart was lower after gastric bypass compared with sleeve gastrectomy among 19599 patients who discontinued their diabetes medication after surgery (30.4% [95% CI, 30.2%-30.5%] vs 35.6% [95% CI, 35.4%-35.9%]), 21611 patients who discontinued their antihypertensive medication after surgery (67.2% [95% CI, 66.9%-67.4%] vs 70.6% [95% CI, 70.3%-70.9%]), and 18546 patients who discontinued their lipid-lowering medication after surgery (46.2% [95% CI, 46.2%-46.3%] vs 52.5% [95% CI, 52.2%-52.7%])., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Findings of this study suggest that, compared with sleeve gastrectomy, gastric bypass was associated with a slightly higher incidence of medication discontinuation and a slightly lower incidence of medication restart among patients who discontinued medication. Long-term trials are needed to explain the mechanisms and factors associated with differences in medication discontinuation and comorbidity resolution after bariatric surgery."

Kowdley"	Nutritional Approaches to Achieve Weight Loss in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease	2017	https://dx.doi.org/10.3945/an.116.013730		"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) can range in spectrum from simple hepatic steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is characterized by lipotoxicity, hepatocellular ballooning, and inflammation and can progress to cirrhosis. Weight loss is the cornerstone treatment for NAFLD and NASH. Various randomized controlled trials have shown that weight loss of >=5-10% leads to significant improvements in hepatic steatosis. Diets high in sodium and fructose have been implicated in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Although some clinical studies suggest that an isocaloric high-fructose diet does not worsen NAFLD, these clinical studies are often short in duration. More recently, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, a sodium-restricted diet, has been associated with less prevalence of NAFLD and has been shown to improve NAFLD. In addition, the Mediterranean diet has been promising in improving hepatic steatosis, and a larger randomized controlled trial is currently enrolling subjects. For those who are unable to pursue weight loss through dietary approaches, bariatric surgery has been shown to improve hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis. This method has been variable in improving hepatic fibrosis. In conclusion, weight loss is crucial to the improvement of NAFLD and NASH, and patients should attempt various diets in an attempt to achieve weight loss.

We have developed a new procedure-single-incision transumbilical LRYGB (SITU-LRYGB)-that results in minimal scarring and is more cosmetically acceptable. To compare the surgical results and patient satisfaction between 5-port LRYGB and the novel SITU-LRYGB at a university hospital., METHODS: We performed 5-port or SITU-LRYGB on 140 morbidly obese patients; the patients chose the operation method. We used a novel liver traction method and omega-umbilicoplasty specifically designed for SITU-LRYGB., RESULTS: Before surgery, the patients in the 5-port surgery group were more obese than those in the SITU group (120.8 kg versus 108.9 kg, P = .013). The rate of hypertension was also greater in the former group. The operative time was longer for SITU-LRYGB (101.1 versus 81.1 min, P = .001) without increased intraoperative complications. The total morphine dose for the SITU group seemed to be greater but the difference was not statistically significant. No difference in complications was observed. Postoperatively, the percentage of excess body weight lost the SITU and 5-port surgery groups was 21.2% and 20.9%, 40.4% and 39.4%, 55.0% and 55.2%, 64.8% and 75.2%, and 75.4% and 78.2% at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, respectively. The SITU-LRYGB patients reported greater satisfaction related to scarring than those who had undergone 5-port surgery (score 4.57 versus 3.96, respectively, P = .005). No patient died., CONCLUSION: Compared with conventional LRYGB, SITU-LRYGB resulted in acceptable complications, the same recovery, comparative weight loss, and better patient satisfaction related to scarring.

We studied the effect of ghrelin on healthy humans, in obesity and in vagotomized subjects., DESIGN: Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover., SUBJECTS: Seven lean [mean body mass index (BMI) 23.6 +/- 0.9 kg/m(2) ], seven morbidly obese (mean BMI 50.9 +/- 4.4 kg/m(2) ) and seven post-gastrectomy subjects (mean BMI 22.0 +/- 1.1 kg/m(2) )., MEASUREMENTS: Subjects were randomized to intravenous ghrelin (5 pmol/kg/min) or saline over 270 min. Subjects had a fixed calorie meal and a free choice buffet during the infusion. Heart rate variability (HRV) was measured. Total power (TP) represents overall autonomic function, low-frequency (LF) power represents sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, and high-frequency (HF) power represents parasympathetic activity. Very low (VLO) frequency represents the frequency band associated with thermogenesis., RESULTS: Preliminary anova analysis, looking at all three subject groups together, showed that ghrelin had an overall highly significant inhibitory effect on TP (P = 0.001), HF power (P = 0.04), VLO power (P = 0.03) and no effect on LF (P = 0.07). Further subset analysis revealed that ghrelin had a significant effect on TP (P = 0.03), borderline effect on LF power (P = 0.06) and no effect on HF power (P = 0.1) in healthy controls. By contrast in obese subjects, ghrelin had no effect on TP (P = 0.3), LF (P = 0.5) and HF (P = 0.06) and also no effect in the vagotomized subjects on TP (P = 0.7), LF (P = 0.7) and HF (P = 0.9). Ghrelin had no effect on the LF/HF ratio., CONCLUSIONS: Ghrelin inhibits SNS activity in healthy controls with a moderate effect on parasympathetic nervous system activity but had no effect on obese subjects. Vagotomized subjects also did not respond to ghrelin, suggesting the vagus nerve is important for the effects of peripheral ghrelin on the SNS. Copyright © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."

Exenatide is a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist that can improve glycemic control and cause weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes. Clinical experience with exenatide in obese patients with type 2 diabetes waiting for bariatric surgery has not been reported. The aim of the study was to evaluate, in clinical practice, weight and metabolic effects of exenatide (after 3 and 6 months) in patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity waiting for bariatric surgery., METHODS: A total of 100 diabetic adult subjects with a BMI >= 35 kg/m(2) were included. Primary endpoints were changes in weight and HbA1c after 6 months of treatment. Secondary endpoints were changes from baseline of a variety of clinical measures (triglycerides levels, blood pressure, and waist circumference). Data were analyzed at 3 and 6 months of follow-up., RESULTS: Treatment for 6 months with exenatide decreased significantly body weight (-12.5 kg) and waist circumference (-13 cm). Twenty percent of patients reduced their BMI under 35 kg/m(2) and significantly improved their metabolic profile (HbA1c <7 %). Significant and maintained decreases in HbA1c of 1 % were observed in the 3 and 6 months cohorts. Triglycerides levels and blood pressure also decreased from baseline to the end of the study. Treatment was discontinued in 19 % of patients mainly due to drug inefficacy (6 %) or adverse events (4 %)., CONCLUSIONS: Exenatide twice daily (BID) leads to early, robust, and significant weight loss in a subset of patients with diabetes and severe obesity before bariatric surgery. Clinical trials are needed to confirm the benefits of GLP-1 agonists in type 2 diabetic obese patients or high-risk super-obese patients waiting for bariatric surgery."

We aimed to assess outcomes of diabetes control and treatment risks 2 years after adding Roux_en_Y gastric bypass to intensive lifestyle and medical management. METHODS: We report 2_year outcomes of a 5_year randomised trial (the Diabetes Surgery Study) at four teaching hospitals (three in the USA and one in Taiwan). At baseline, eligible participants had to have HbA1c of at least 8á0% (64 mmol/mol), BMI between 30á0 and 39á9 kg/m(2), and type 2 diabetes for at least 6 months, and be aged 30_67 years. We randomly assigned participants to receive either intensive lifestyle and medical management alone (lifestyle and medical management), or lifestyle and medical management plus standard Roux_en_Y gastric bypass surgery (gastric bypass). Staff from the clinical centres had access to data from individual patients, but were masked to other patients' data and aggregated data until the 2_year follow_up. Drugs for hyperglycaemia, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia were prescribed by protocol. The primary endpoint was achievement of the composite treatment goal of HbA1c less than 7á0% (53 mmol/mol), LDL cholesterol less than 2á59 mmol/L, and systolic blood pressure less than 130 mm Hg at 12 months; here we report the composite outcome and other pre_planned secondary outcomes at 24 months. Analyses were done on an intention_to_treat basis, with multiple imputations for missing data. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00641251, and is still ongoing. FINDINGS: Between April 21, 2008, and Nov 21, 2011, we randomly assigned 120 eligible patients to either lifestyle and medical management alone (n=60) or with the addition of gastric bypass (n=60). One patient in the lifestyle and medical management group died (from pancreatic cancer), thus 119 were included in the primary analysis. Significantly more participants in the gastric bypass group achieved the composite triple endpoint at 24 months than in the lifestyle and medical management group (26 [43%] vs eight [14%]; odds ratio 5á1 [95% CI 2á0_12á6], p=0á0004), mainly through improved glycaemic control (HbA1c <7á0% [53 mmol/mol] in 45 [75%] vs 14 [24%]; treatment difference _1á9% (_2á5 to _1á4); p=0á0001). 46 clinically important adverse events occurred in the gastric bypass group and 25 in the lifestyle and medical management group (mainly infections in both groups [four in the lifestyle and medical management group, eight in the gastric bypass group]). With a negative binomial model adjusted for site, the event rate for the gastric bypass group was non_significantly higher than the lifestyle and medical management group by a factor of 1á67 (95% CI 0á98_2á87, p=0á06). Across both years of the study, the gastric bypass group had seven serious falls with five fractures, compared with three serious falls and one fracture in the lifestyle and medical management group. All fractures happened in women. Many more nutritional deficiencies occurred in the gastric bypass group (mainly deficiencies in iron, albumin, calcium, and vitamin D), despite protocol use of nutritional supplements. INTERPRETATION: The addition of gastric bypass to lifestyle and medical management in patients with type 2 diabetes improved diabetes control, but adverse events and nutritional deficiencies were more frequent. Larger and longer studies are needed to investigate whether the benefits and risk of gastric bypass for type 2 diabetes can be balanced.

Result(s): All 120 patients received the intensive lifestyle-medical management protocol and 60 were randomly assigned to undergo Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. After 12-months, 28 participants (49%; 95% CI, 36%-63%) in the gastric bypass group and 11 (19%; 95% CI, 10%-32%) in the lifestyle-medical management group achieved the primary end points (odds ratio [OR], 4.8; 95% CI, 1.9-11.7). Participants in the gastric bypass group required 3.0 fewer medications (mean, 1.7 vs 4.8; 95% CI for the difference, 2.3-3.6) and lost 26.1% vs 7.9% of their initial body weigh compared with the lifestyle-medical management group (difference, 17.5%; 95% CI, 14.2%-20.7%). Regression analyses indicated that achieving the composite end point was primarily attributable to weight loss. There were 22 serious adverse events in the gastric bypass group, including 1 cardiovascular event, and 15 in the lifestyle-medical management group. There were 4 perioperative complications and 6 late postoperative complications. The gastric bypass group experienced more nutritional deficiency than the lifestyle-medical management group. Conclusions and Relevance: In mild to moderately obese patients with type 2 diabetes, adding gastric bypass surgery to lifestyle and medical management was associated with a greater likelihood of achieving the composite goal. Potential benefits of adding gastric bypass surgery to the best lifestyle and medical management strategies of diabetes must be weighed against the risk of serious adverse events.

OBJECTIVE: To compare durability of Roux_en_Y gastric bypass added to intensive lifestyle and medical management in achieving diabetes control targets. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Observational follow_up of a randomized clinical trial at 4 sites in the United States and Taiwan, involving 120 participants who had a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of 8.0% or higher and a body mass index between 30.0 and 39.9 (enrolled between April 2008 and December 2011) were followed up for 5 years, ending in November 2016. INTERVENTIONS: Lifestyle_intensive medical management intervention based on the Diabetes Prevention Program and LookAHEAD trials for 2 years, with and without (60 participants each) Roux_en_Y gastric bypass surgery followed by observation to year 5. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The American Diabetes Association composite triple end point of hemoglobin A1c less than 7.0%, low_density lipoprotein cholesterol less than 100 mg/dL, and systolic blood pressure less than 130 mm Hg at 5 years. RESULTS: Of 120 participants who were initially randomized (mean age, 49 years [SD, 8 years], 72 women [60%]), 98 (82%) completed 5 years of follow_up. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups: mean (SD) body mass index 34.4 (3.2) for the lifestyle_medical management group and 34.9 (3.0) for the gastric bypass group and had hemoglobin A1c levels of 9.6% (1.2) and 9.6% (1.0), respectively. At 5 years, 13 participants (23%) in the gastric bypass group and 2 (4%) in the lifestyle_intensive medical management group had achieved the composite triple end point (difference, 19%; 95% CI, 4%_34%; P_=_.01). In the fifth year, 31 patients (55%) in the gastric bypass group vs 8 (14%) in the lifestyle_medical management group achieved an HbA1c level of less than 7.0% (difference, 41%; 95% CI, 19%_63%; P_=_.002). Gastric bypass had more serious adverse events than did the lifestyle_medical management intervention, 66 events vs 38 events, most frequently gastrointestinal events and surgical complications such as strictures, small bowel obstructions, and leaks. Gastric bypass had more parathyroid hormone elevation but no difference in B12 deficiency. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In extended follow_up of obese adults with type 2 diabetes randomized to adding gastric bypass compared with lifestyle and intensive medical management alone, there remained a significantly better composite triple end point in the surgical group at 5 years. However, because the effect size diminished over 5 years, further follow_up is needed to understand the durability of the improvement.

Higa"	A multidisciplinary approach to the adolescent bariatric surgical patient	2004			"PURPOSE: Pediatric obesity is an epidemic in the United States. As of yet, no surgical programs specifically dedicated to the management of clinically severely obese adolescents exist. The purpose of this report was to describe the establishment and early experience of a multidisciplinary Comprehensive Weight Management Center (CWMC) in a free-standing children's hospital., METHODS: With input from an ethicist, gastroenterologist, pulmonologist, endocrinologist, and adolescent medicine physician, guidelines for patient selection, evaluation, and bariatric surgical management were developed and implemented. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) surgery has been performed using open and laparoscopic techniques., RESULTS: The average age and body mas index (BMI) for 79 patients referred to the CWMC has been 16 years and 54 kg/m2, for boys and 17 years and 51 kg/m2 for girls. Twenty-five percent have been considered appropriate for RYGBP, 25% have not met criteria for surgery, and 50% are being evaluated. Ten patients who have undergone RYGBP had comorbidities of their obesity, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), pulmonary embolism, hypertension, dyslipidemias, and depression. Clinically significant weight loss with resolution of comorbidities has occurred in all patients. Significant complications have included leak from the gastric remnant, DVT, partial roux limb obstruction, and micronutrient deficiency., CONCLUSIONS: RYGBP is an effective means to treat obesity-related morbidity in the adolescent. A multidisciplinary team of pediatric specialists is needed for optimal preoperative decision making and postoperative management. Results have been satisfactory and justify a clinical trial to confirm the safety and efficacy of bariatric surgery in the adolescent population."

Teen-LABS enrolled 242 adolescents (<=19 years of age) from March 1, 2007, through December 31, 2011. TODAY randomized 699 participants (aged 10-17 years) from July 24, 2004, through February 25, 2009. Data analysis was performed from July 6, 2015, to June 24, 2017. Anthropometric, clinical, and laboratory data from adolescents with severe obesity and type 2 diabetes who underwent treatment with metabolic or bariatric surgery in the Teen-LABS study or medical therapy in the TODAY study were compared., Interventions: Teen-LABS participants underwent a primary bariatric surgical procedure; TODAY participants were randomized to receive metformin therapy alone or in combination with rosiglitazone or an intensive lifestyle intervention; insulin therapy was given in cases of progression of disease., Main Outcomes and Measures: Glycemic control, body mass index, prevalence of elevated blood pressure, dyslipidemia, abnormal kidney function, and clinical adverse events were measured., Results: Data from 30 participants from Teen-LABS (mean [SD] age at baseline, 16.9 [1.3] years; 21 [70%] female; 18 [66%] white) and 63 from TODAY (mean [SD] age at baseline, 15.3 [1.3] years; 28 [44%] female; 45 [71%] white) were analyzed. During 2 years, mean hemoglobin A1c concentration decreased from 6.8% (95% CI, 6.4%-7.3%) to 5.5% (95% CI, 4.7% -6.3%) in Teen-LABS and increased from 6.4% (95% CI, 6.1%-6.7%) to 7.8% (95% CI, 7.2%-8.3%) in TODAY. Compared with baseline, the body mass index decreased by 29% (95% CI, 24%-34%) in Teen-LABS and increased by 3.7% (95% CI, 0.8%-6.7%) in TODAY. Twenty-three percent of Teen-LABS participants required a subsequent operation during the 2-year follow-up., Conclusions and Relevance: Compared with medical therapy, surgical treatment of severely obese adolescents with type 2 diabetes was associated with better glycemic control, reduced weight, and improvement of other comorbidities. These data support the need for a well-designed, prospective controlled study to define the role of surgery for adolescents with type 2 diabetes, including health and surgical outcomes."

Oxidative stress profile and type 2 diabetes remission at 6 months after sleeve gastrectomy versus conservatory treatment	2019	10.31925/farmacia.2019.1.13	CN-01916591	"The aim of this study was to examine the impact of weight loss on oxidant_antioxidant profile in obese T2D patients. The study was carried out on 38 obese T2D males randomized in two groups, one that underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and the other an intensive diet intervention (DTG) and standard diabetes treatment. Body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, HDL_cholesterol, triglycerides, HbA1c and C Reactive Protein (CRP) were evaluated at baseline and after 6 months of follow_up. Ghrelin, insulin, C peptide, leptin and adiponectin were also measured in all subjects by ELISA method. For oxidative stress profile, ÒRespiratory BurstÓ and the antioxidants enzymes: paraoxonase1 (PON1), glutationperoxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) were evaluated. After LSG, BMI and metabolic control improved significantly: weight loss 78.98%, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) < 11.0 mmol/L and HbA1c < 6%. Antioxidant enzymes GPx and CAT increased after 6 months in both groups. By using univariate conditional regression model we were able to highlight that patients with an unfavourable evolution regarding T2D remission (HbA1c > 6%) had higher values (at baseline and after 6_months) for BMI, C peptide and CRP and lower values (at baseline and after 6 months) for HDL and adiponectin (as an anti_inflammatory factor). We conclude that the significant weight fluctuations can directly influence antioxidant enzyme profiles and may play an important role in the mediation of weight loss and the beneficial metabolic effects of LSG."

Isrctn	Ward based goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) in acute pancreatitis	2018		CN-01899462	"INTERVENTION: Patients admitted with acute pancreatitis will be randomised using sealed envelope (www.sealedenvelope.com) to one of the following groups for the first 48 hours of the hospital stay: Standard care: The amount and rate of fluid therapy (balanced electrolyte solution) will be based on the blood pressure, heart rate and urine output as per clinician choice. Ward based GDFT: GDFT will be carried out for 48 hours after admission. It can take up to 48 hours for the severity of pancreatitis to manifest. GDFT will be based on a standard algorithm which uses the stroke volume (SV) derived from non_invasive cardiac output monitoring using the Cheetah NICOM. The fluid administration will be as follows: Maintenance fluid should be administered at 1.5 ml/kg/hr as a balance crystalloid solution. On admission SV is recorded and an initial bolus of 250ml of IV fluid (balanced electrolyte solution) is given over 5 to 10 minutes. If there is a sustained rise in stroke volume for 15 minutes or more, this indicates fluid responsiveness and a repeat 250ml bolus will be given. If there is a rise in SV of more than 10%, the patient is deemed to be fluid responsive and the process of administering a fluid bolus repeated. If there is not a rise in SV of 10% or more then the patient is deemed fluid unresponsive and no further fluid bolus is administered. SV monitoring continues four hourly and if it decreases by more than 10% a further fluid bolus is administered as above. Total duration of follow_up is 3 months.

Patients will be randomly assigned to the groups. A simple randomization sequence will be generated by computer, which will represent the allocation of each participant, and will be introduced in sealed, opaque envelopes, numbered in sequential order that will correspond to the order in which participants will be randomized. Each participant will be randomized (the corresponding envelope will be opened in front of the participant) at medical discharge, that is, after having fulfilled the inclusion criteria, signed informed consent, performed baseline evaluation and after having undergone bariatric surgery. The intervention will start approximately 7 days after medical discharge. Exercise Group. The patients assigned to the Exercise Group (EG) will carry out a supervised exercise program of 48 sessions distributed in 16 weeks with a frequency of 3 sessions per week and a volume of 1 hour per session. The exercise program will combine resistance and aerobic training in the same session (i.e. concurrent training). The exercise program will comply with international recommendations for resistance and aerobic training, following criteria for effective and safe progression. In order to standardize the protocol and maximize its transparency and replicability, the guidelines stated in the Consensus on Exercise Reporting Template (CERT), which describes all the parameters that should be reported in a physical exercise program, will be followed.

Effects of aronia berry (poly)phenols on vascular function and gut microbiota: a double-blind randomized controlled trial in adult men	2019	10.1093/ajcn/nqz075	CN-01957382	"BACKGROUND: Aronia melanocarpa is a rich source of (poly)phenols. Previous research has demonstrated that these berries may provide cardiovascular health benefits in high_risk populations. However, very few studies have investigated the effects of daily consumption of dietary achievable amounts of the berries in healthy subjects. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of aronia berries on vascular function and gut microbiota composition in a healthy population. METHODS: A double_blind, placebo_controlled, parallel designed study was conducted in 66 healthy men randomly allocated to consume a (poly)phenol_rich extract (116 mg, 75 g berries), a whole fruit powder (12 mg, 10 g berries), or placebo (maltodextrin) for 12 wk. Flow_mediated dilation (FMD), arterial stiffness, blood pressure, heart rate, and serum biochemistry were assessed. Plasma (poly)phenol metabolites were analyzed by LC_MS. Gut microbiota composition was determined via 16S rRNA sequencing in stool samples. RESULTS: Consumption of aronia whole fruit and extract powder for 12 wk led to a significant increase in FMD over control of 0.9% ± 0.4% (95% CI: 0.13%, 1.72%) and 1.2% ± 0.4% (95% CI: 0.36%, 1.97%), respectively. Acute improvements in FMD were also observed 2 h after consumption of aronia extract on day 1 (1.1% ± 0.3%, P = 0.003) and 12 wk later (1.5% ± 0.4%, P = 0.0001). Circulating plasma phenolic metabolites increased upon consumption of the aronia treatments. Although no changes were found in gut microbiota diversity, consumption of aronia extract increased the growth of Anaerostipes (+10.6%, P = 0.01), whereas aronia whole fruit showed significant increases in Bacteroides (+193%, P = 0.01). Correlation analysis identified significant associations between changes in FMD, aronia_derived phenolic metabolites, and specific gut microbial genera. CONCLUSIONS: In healthy men, consumption of aronia berry (poly)phenols improved endothelial function and modulated gut microbiota composition, indicating that regular aronia consumption has the potential to maintain cardiovascular health in individuals at low risk of cardiovascular disease. This trial was registered at CLINICALTRIALs.gov as NCT03041961."

Tanaka	Greedy Organs Hypothesis for sugar and salt in the pathophysiology of non-communicable diseases in relation to sodium-glucose co-transporters in the intestines and the kidney	2022	https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.metop.2022.100169		"Deposition of visceral fat and insulin resistance play central role in the development of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including obesity, hypertension and type 2 diabetes. However, we shed more light upon the intestines and the kidney as a strong driver of NCDs. Based upon unexpected outcomes of clinical trials using sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2 inhibitors to demonstrate their actions for not only body weight reduction and blood glucose fall but also remarkable cardiorenal protection, we speculate that hyperfunction of the intestines and the kidney is one of critical contributing factors for initiation of NCDs. By detecting high amount of glucose and sodium chloride around them by sweet/salt taste sensors, the intestines and the kidney are designed to (re)absorb these nutrients by up-regulating SGLT1 or SGLT2. We designate these hyperfunctioning organs for nutrient uptake as ""greedy organs"". The greedy organs can induce NCDs (""greedy organ hypothesis""). SGLTs are regulated by glucose and sodium chloride, and SGLTs or other genes can be ""greedy genes."" Regulating factors for greedy organs are renin-angiotensin system, renal sympathetic nervous activity, gut inflammation/microbiota or oxidative stress. Mitigation of organ greediness by SGLT2 inhibitors, ketone bodies, bariatric surgery, and regular lifestyle to keep rhythmicity of biological clock are promising. Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

A literature search was performed using the key words obesity, weight loss, CVD, cardiometabolic, and risk factors and included key clinical trials from the past 5 years. Obesity management through weight loss is associated with improvements in CVD risk factors, such as improved blood pressure, lipid profiles, and glycemic control, with greater weight loss leading to greater improvements in CVD risk factors. Bariatric surgery is associated with greater weight loss than the other procedures and treatments for obesity, and for this, and possibly for other reasons, it is associated with greater reductions in CVD outcomes and mortality. Obesity is an independent risk factor and modulator of other CVD risk factors, and thus, treatment of obesity should be an integral part of management strategies to reduce CVD risk. Future trials and real-world studies of longer duration are needed to inform providers and patients on how to individualize the approach to modifying risks of cardiometabolic disorders through obesity management.

Stanford"	The Role of Bariatric Surgery on Diabetes and Diabetic Care Compliance	2019	https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11892-019-1236-0		"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Bariatric surgery is a durable and long-term solution to treat both obesity and its associated comorbidities, specifically type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Many studies have demonstrated the benefits of bariatric surgery on T2DM, but weight recidivism along with recurrence of comorbidities can be seen following these procedures. Patient compliance post-bariatric surgery is linked to weight loss outcomes and comorbidity improvement/resolution. The role of compliance with respect to T2DM medication in bariatric patients specifically has not recently been examined. This article seeks to review the role of bariatric surgery on short- and long-term resolution of T2DM, recurrence, and compliance with T2DM medication following bariatric surgery., RECENT FINDINGS: Seven randomized control trials have examined metabolic surgery versus medical therapy in glycemic control in patients meeting criteria for severe obesity. Six out of seven studies demonstrate a significant advantage in the surgical arms with regards to glycemic control, as well as secondary endpoints such as weight loss, serum lipid levels, blood pressure, renal function, and other parameters. While patient compliance with lifestyle modifications post-bariatric surgery is linked to weight loss outcomes, there are no studies to date that directly evaluate the role of lifestyle modifications and T2DM medication adherence in the management of T2DM post-bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment option to achieve long-term weight loss and resolution of obesity-related medical comorbidities, specifically T2DM. Patient compliance to lifestyle modifications post-bariatric surgery is linked to weight loss outcomes and comorbidity resolution. The role of diabetic care compliance in bariatric patient outcomes, however, is poorly understood. Further studies are needed to elucidate the predictors and associated risk factors for non-compliance in this patient population."

Docherty"	Bariatric Surgery and Microvascular Complications of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	2014	https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11883-014-0453-x		"Metabolic dysregulation is the defining characteristic of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and can give rise to microvascular complications, specifically retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. Pharmacological targeting of risk factors for microvascular complications can yield therapeutic gains, particularly in relation to retinopathy and nephropathy. Bariatric surgery is superior to intensified pharmacotherapy in relation to glycaemic control and can remediate dyslipidaemia and hypertension. Consequently, evidence of the effect of bariatric surgery on microvascular complications is now emerging in the literature. Examination of the recent published evidence base (covering the period 2011-2014) on the effects of bariatric surgery on microvascular complications reveals further evidence supportive of the efficacy of bariatric surgery in preventing the incidence and progression of albuminuria and arresting renal functional decline. Data on retinopathy are more ambivalent potentially representing the potential in some cases for a degree of surgery associated reactive hypoglycaemia to detract from the benefits of amelioration of hyperglycaemia. A significant gap in the literature remains in relation to the effects of surgery on diabetic neuropathy. Overall, there is a pressing need for prospective randomised controlled trials examining long-term microvascular outcomes following bariatric surgery in patients with T2DM.Copyright © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Flow mediated vasodilation (FMD) is a marker of endothelial function and its decline is related to increased cardiovascular risk. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the impact of bariatric surgery on FMD. Materials and methods. A systematic literature search in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science was performed to 1 May 2021. Meta-analysis was performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) V2 software. All types of bariatric surgery were considered, with the inclusion that FMD had to have been tested before and after the surgical procedure. Meta-analysis was carried out using a random-effects model and the generic inverse variance approach. The leave-one-out approach was used for sensitivity analysis. To assess metabolic parameter confounders, a weighted random-effects meta-regression was used. Results . A meta-analysis and a systematic review of 23 studies (n = 891 individuals) demonstrated improvement in FMD following bariatric surgery (weighted mean difference (WMD): 5.867, 95% CI: 4.481, 7.252, p < 0.001; I2: 96.70). Iteratively removing each item in the meta-analysis did not result in a significant alteration in the pooled estimate of effect size. There was an improvement in FMD for up to 6 months following bariatric surgery in a meta-analysis from 7 trials that included 356 subjects (WMD: 5.248, 95% CI: 2.361, 8.135, p < 0.001; I2: 98.18). The meta-analysis from 9 trials (n = 414 subjects) showed an improvement in FMD 6 to 12 months after bariatric surgery (WMD: 5.451, 95% CI: 3.316, 7.587, p < 0.001; I2: 94.18). The meta-analysis from 10 trials (n = 414 subjects) demonstrated an improvement in FMD 12 months after bariatric surgery (WMD: 2.401, 95% CI: 0.944, 3.859, p = 0.001; I2: 88.35). Random-effects meta-regression did not show any association between the alteration in FMD and percent body mass index (BMI) change (slope: 0.0258; 95% CI: ...0.323, 0.375; p = 0.884), or changes in blood pressure; however, there was an association between the changes in FMD and the duration of follow-up (slope: ...0.106; 95% CI: ...0.205, ...0.008; p = 0.033) with greater changes in FMD after 12 months. Conclusions . Bariatric surgery significantly improved FMD that increased with time, and the resultant improvement in endothelial function was independent of weight loss or a reduction in blood pressure."

Rehabilitation programs offer the possibility of adapted exercise programs, increasing exercise capacity, and decreasing dyspnea. Medical and supportive management of weight loss often has limited results, but bariatric surgery can induce significant weight loss in selected individuals, contributing to an improvement in AHI and hypoventilation. A few drugs have been shown to have a modest effect on respiratory drive in OHS, but their impact is marginal and no medication is presently recommended for the treatment of OHS. LTOT must not be considered as an alternative to positive pressure therapy (CPAP or NIV), and may have deleterious effects. However, oxygen supplementation may be indicated after optimal titration of NIV. The benefit in terms of survival, HRQL, and prevention of secondary pulmonary hypertension of nocturnal oxygen supplementation for patients having a daytime PaO2 higher than 8 kPa (60 mm Hg) has yet to be established through randomized trials. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to assess the clinical and financial impact of the real_life implementation of intraoperative GDFT in patients undergoing elective gastrointestinal surgery in a Chinese tertiary medical center. Methods: This Quality Improvement Program (QIP) study comprised three phases of 5, 1, and 5 months, respectively. During the first phase, we retrospectively collected perioperative data from patients who received standard intraoperative fluid management from January to May 2016. Then a 1_month training period allowed the clinical staff to become familiar with the GDFT protocol. After the training phase, GDFT was used from July to November 2016. In the GDFT group, stroke volume (SV) was continuously monitored and optimized towards the plateau of the Frank_Starling curve. The primary outcome measure was postoperative morbidity (the proportion of patients with one or more complications within 30 days after surgery). Secondary outcomes were total hospital cost, postoperative length of hospital stay, and 30_day mortality. Results: Data from 200 patients before (control group) and 201 patients after the implementation of GDFT (GDFT group) were collected and compared. There was no significant difference in demographics and surgical procedures between the two groups. Postoperative morbidity was significantly lower in the GDFT group than in the control group (30.8% vs. 44.0%, p = 0.006). No significant differences were observed for mean total hospital cost (76,793 RMB vs. 74,444 RMB; p = 0.430), median postoperative length of hospital stay (10 days vs. 10 days; p = 0.104), and 30_day mortality (1% vs. 0.5%; p = 0.565). Conclusion: In patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery, the implementation of a GDFT protocol was associated with a reduction in postoperative morbidity without increasing costs.

When multiple similar studies were available, random-effects meta-analyses were conducted., Main Outcomes and Measures: Sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), AHI, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores, blood pressure, mortality, cardiovascular events, motor vehicle crashes, quality of life, and harms., Results: A total of 110 studies were included (N = 46188). No RCTs compared screening with no screening. In 2 studies (n = 702), the screening accuracy of the multivariable apnea prediction score followed by home portable monitor testing for detecting severe OSA syndrome (AHI >=30 and ESS score >10) was AUC 0.80 (95% CI, 0.78 to 0.82) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.77 to 0.90), respectively, but the studies oversampled high-risk participants and those with OSA and OSA syndrome. No studies prospectively evaluated screening tools to report calibration or clinical utility for improving health outcomes. Meta-analysis found that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) compared with sham was significantly associated with reduction of AHI (weighted mean difference [WMD], -33.8 [95% CI, -42.0 to -25.6]; 13 trials, 543 participants), excessive sleepiness assessed by ESS score (WMD, -2.0 [95% CI, -2.6 to -1.4]; 22 trials, 2721 participants), diurnal systolic blood pressure (WMD, -2.4 points [95% CI, -3.9 to -0.9]; 15 trials, 1190 participants), and diurnal diastolic blood pressure (WMD, -1.3 points [95% CI, -2.2 to -0.4]; 15 trials, 1190 participants). CPAP was associated with modest improvement in sleep-related quality of life (Cohen d, 0.28 [95% CI, 0.14 to 0.42]; 13 trials, 2325 participants). Mandibular advancement devices (MADs) and weight loss programs were also associated with reduced AHI and excessive sleepiness. Common adverse effects of CPAP and MADs included oral or nasal dryness, irritation, and pain, among others. In cohort studies, there was a consistent association between AHI and all-cause mortality., Conclusions and Relevance: There is uncertainty about the accuracy or clinical utility of all potential screening tools. Multiple treatments for OSA reduce AHI, ESS scores, and blood pressure. Trials of CPAP and other treatments have not established whether treatment reduces mortality or improves most other health outcomes, except for modest improvement in sleep-related quality of life."

SAGES appropriateness conference statement	2004			"BACKGROUND: Obesity is a growing health problem that contributes to numerous life-threatening or disabling disorders, including coronary artery disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, degenerative joint disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. Significant weight reduction in the morbidly obese improves or reverses associated illness and benefits well-being. The purpose of the SAGES Appropriateness Conference was to summarize the state of the art for open and laparoscopic operations for the morbidly obese., METHODS: The English literature comparing bariatric procedures was reviewed and grouped by level of evidence by three surgeons (BS, LV, and CC). From more than 1,500 articles, all conference participants were provided with reprints and table summaries of no less than 50 selected manuscripts. Ten experts were requested to present reviews and make evidence-based arguments for and against the open and laparoscopic approaches in written format. An expert panel of six surgeons, including an ethicist and patient, commented on implications of data presented. The finalized statement was e-mailed to all participants for approval and comment., RESULTS: Consensus statements were achieved on various aspects of morbid obesity, including indications for surgery, resolution of comorbid illnesses with significant weight loss, and the importance of committed bariatric program. Our panel of experts agreed, in general, to the advantages of laparoscopic approaches compared to open operations in skilled hands., CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) affords improved short-term recovery compared to open gastric bypass. Laparoscopic adjustable banding can be performed with lower average mortality than either RYGB or any of the malabsorptive operations, and it produces variable degrees of short-term weight loss. Prospective randomized trials are needed to compare gastric bypass, malabsorptive, and restrictive procedures."

Obesity-induced neurohumoral activation appears to be involved. The association between obesity and hypertension shows large inter-individual variability, likely through genetic mechanisms. Obesity affects overall cardiovascular and metabolic risk; yet, the relationship between obesity and cardiovascular risk is complex and not sufficiently addressed in clinical guidelines. The epidemiological observation that obesity may be protective in patients with established cardiovascular disease is difficult to translate into clinical experience and practice. Weight loss is often recommended as a means to lower blood pressure. However, current hypertension guidelines do not provide evidence-based guidance on how to institute weight loss. In fact, weight loss influences on blood pressure may be overestimated. Nevertheless, weight loss through bariatric surgery appears to decrease cardiovascular risk in severely obese patients. Eventually, most obese hypertensive patients will require antihypertensive medications. Data from large-scale studies with hard clinical endpoints on antihypertensive medications specifically addressing obese patients are lacking and the morbidity from the growing population of severely obese patients is poorly recognized or addressed. Because of their broad spectrum of beneficial effects, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors are considered to be the most appropriate drugs for antihypertensive treatment of obese patients. Most obese hypertensive patients require two or more antihypertensive drugs. Finally, how to combine weight loss strategies and antihypertensive treatment to achieve an optimal clinical outcome is unresolved. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

Brimas	Long-term results after sleeve gastrectomy: A systematic review	2017	https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2016.10.006		"Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has become one of the most commonly used bariatric procedures worldwide. However, data regarding long-term results remain insufficient. The aim of this study was to review the long-term results after SG. We conducted a comprehensive literature search of Medline and the Cochrane Library for articles published until May 2016 on the long-term results (>5 yr) after SG. Studies representing outcomes of SG were included if they reported>=5-year results that contained at least one outcome of interest-weight loss, co-morbidities, long-term complications, or quality of life-and SG was performed as a primary procedure. Of the 297 initially identified articles, 277 studies met the exclusion criteria, and 20 met the inclusion criteria. SG was performed on 2713 patients and 1626 patients reached the>=5-year follow-up point. Among the patients, 71.3% were women and 28.7% were men. The mean preoperative body mass index was 46.9 kg/m2. The duration of follow-up ranged 5 to 11 years. The mean 5-year follow-up rate was 66% (range, 57%-100%). The mean percentage excess weight loss was 58.4%, 59.5%, 56.6%, 56.4%, and 62.5% at 5, 6, 7, 8, and 11 years, respectively. Five years after SG, the resolution or improvement of type 2 diabetes was observed in 77.8% of patients, and arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and degenerative joint diseases had improved or resolved in 68.0%, 65.9%, 75.8%, 30.6%, and 55.7% of patients, respectively. This systematic review suggests that SG can lead to substantial and lasting excess weight loss and significant improvement in obesity-related co-morbidities. However, the lack of randomized clinical trials, low follow-up rates, and poorly reported data regarding co-morbidities and quality of life in many of the studies indicate that these findings should be interpreted with caution.

Bariatric surgery, including Roux en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), is currently the most effective treatment to induce long-term weight loss and remission of co-morbid conditions. Surgery, however, comes with an added risk of complications, highlighting the need to understand the comparative effectiveness and risks of surgical versus conventional approaches to the treatment of obesity and T2D., AREAS COVERED: Positive and negative outcomes of RYGB surgery in patients with T2D are assessed, with a primary focus on RYGB surgery versus standard non-surgical treatment of obese patients with T2D in randomized clinical trials or high-quality observational cohorts. Searches were conducted in the PubMed database up to 11 April 2019 for relevant studies., EXPERT OPINION: High-level evidence reveals that RYGB ameliorates the clinical manifestations of T2D to a significantly higher degree than medical therapy. Postoperative incidence of beneficial effects and complications, however, differ across subgroups of patients with different preoperative characteristics. Key knowledge gaps, particularly on long-term complications, microvascular- and macrovascular events, and mortality should be addressed, so treatment with RYGB can be applied in an individualized approach to maximize benefits and minimize complications."

No consensus on the optimal design of this operation has been achieved, with various lengths of bypassed small bowel limb lengths being used by bariatric surgeons. This aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine whether biliopancreatic limb (BPL) length in RYGB affects postoperative outcomes including superior reduction in weight, body mass index (BMI), and resolution of metabolic comorbidities associated with obesity., METHODS: A systematic search of the literature was conducted up until 1st June 2021. Meta-analysis of primary outcomes was performed utilising a random-effects model. Statistical significance was determined by p value < 0.05., RESULTS: Ten randomised controlled trials were included in the final quantitative analysis. No difference in outcomes following short versus long BLP in RYGB was identified at 12-72 months post-operatively, namely in BMI reduction, remission or improvement of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and complications (p > 0.05). Even though results of four studies showed superior total body weight loss in the long BPL cohorts at 24 months post-operatively (pooled mean difference -6.92, 95% CI -12.37, -1.48, p = 0.01), this outcome was not observed at any other timepoint., CONCLUSION: Based on the outcomes of the present study, there is no definitive evidence to suggest that alteration of the BPL affects the quantity of weight loss or resolution of co-existent metabolic comorbidities associated with obesity.

With the increase in obesity rates where nearly two thirds of Americans are either obese or overweight, there has been an increase in the use of pharmacological therapy weight loss. While these therapies have shown benefit in weight reduction, the clinical impact these pharmacological agents on overall CVD outcomes has yet to be determined., AIM: We aimed to assess the effect of pharmacological agents used for weight reduction on CVD risk and all-cause mortality., METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of peer-reviewed literature that evaluated the impact of anti-obesity drugs on cardiovascular outcomes. Key words used included: ""orlistat"", ""lorcaserin"", ""phentermine/topiramate"" or ""naltrexone/bupropion"" and ""cardiovascular outcomes"" among others. We reviewed 791 articles, only 47 studies were randomized controlled trials and only 7 studies fulfilled all the inclusion criteria including, quantitative data on cardiovascular risk factors such as, Hemoglobin A1C (A1C), changes in body mass index (BMI), blood pressure and CVD morbidity and mortality. Data was retrieved from these studies and evaluated with comprehensive meta-analysis software R to assess pooled effects for medical management versus placebo., RESULTS: There were 7 studies included in the final analysis, with a total of 18,598 subjects, of which 8,685 were in the intervention (INT) group and 9,913 in the control (CTRL) group. For all cause mortality, there were 45 events in the INT and 55 in the CTRL groups, suggesting no significant difference between the two groups (OR: 0.843, 95%CI: 0.571-1.244, Z: -0.860, P: 0.390). For CVD mortality, there were 17 events in the INT and 36 events in the CTRL groups suggesting a significant mortality benefit in the INT group (OR:0.496, 95% CI: 0.282-0.873, Z: -2.433, P: 0.015). There was a significant absolute reduction in A1C in the INT group (Hg: -0.238, 95%CI: -0.291 to -0.186, Z: -8.937, P< 0.001). The percentage weight reduction was significantly higher for the INT group compared to the CTRL group (Hg: -0.431, 95%CI: -0.477 to -0.385, Z: -18.472, P< 0.001) and the blood pressure reduction was higher for the INT group compared to the CTRL group. (Hg: -0.052, 95%CI: -0.101- -0.003, Z: -2.086, P: 0.037). The heterogeneity observed for our meta analysis is Q: 1.884, df: 6, P: 0.930., CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated the favorable and significant effect of pharmacological weight reduction strategies on weight loss, blood pressure reduction, glycemic control (A1C reduction), and CVD mortality.While weight loss without pharmacological means has been shown to reduce CVD risk, the mechanism by which weight loss medications impact CVD risk reduction could be a direct effect of these agents or merely an effect of weight reduction itself. Weight loss has been noted to modify risk factors via improving insulin sensitivity, reducing inflammation, decreasing blood pressure and modifying the lipid profile, In addition, the mechanism of action of the medications are not directly anti-inflammatory, and do not directly modify insulin sensitivity, blood pressure or the lipid profile. Thus, it is most likely that the benefit on cardiovascular disease from these therapies is via weight reduction and not direct medication effect.Given the limited efficacy of the lifestyle modification on sustained weight loss and the surgical risk and limited availability of bariatric surgical options. Our data suggests pharmacological weight loss therapy may be a valuable treatment option to reduce CVD risk in obese patients. Further research is needed to clarify the effects these therapies on overall mortality and evaluate the mechanisms by which these medications reduce CVD risk factors and mortality."

The most common cause of obesity throughout childhood and adolescence is an inequity in energy balance; that is, excess caloric intake without appropriate caloric expenditure. Adiposity rebound (AR) in early childhood is a risk factor for obesity in adolescence and adulthood. The increasing prevalence of childhood and adolescent obesity is associated with a rise in comorbidities previously identified in the adult population, such as Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver disease (NAFLD), Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), and Dyslipidemia. Due to the lack of a single treatment option to address obesity, clinicians have generally relied on counseling dietary changes and exercise. Due to psychosocial issues that may accompany adolescence regarding body habitus, this approach can have negative results. Teens can develop unhealthy eating habits that result in Bulimia Nervosa (BN), Binge- Eating Disorder (BED), or Night eating syndrome (NES). Others can develop Anorexia Nervosa (AN) as they attempt to restrict their diet and overshoot their goal of ""being healthy."" To date, lifestyle interventions have shown only modest effects on weight loss. Emerging findings from basic science as well as interventional drug trials utilizing GLP-1 agonists have demonstrated success in effective weight loss in obese adults, adolescents, and pediatric patients. However, there is limited data on the efficacy and safety of other weight-loss medications in children and adolescents. Nearly 6% of adolescents in the United States are severely obese and bariatric surgery as a treatment consideration will be discussed. In summary, this paper will overview the pathophysiology, clinical, and psychological implications, and treatment options available for obese pediatric and adolescent patients.

In the present study of patients with severe obesity, we investigated the effects of surgically induced weight loss on cardiorespiratory symptoms and leisure-time physical activity., METHODS: The Swedish Obese Subjects study is an ongoing intervention trial of obesity consisting of 1 surgically treated group and 1 matched control group. Information on smoking habits, hypertension, diabetes, and sleep apnea was obtained from 1210 surgical cases and 1099 controls who were observed for 2 years. Patients were also asked about symptoms of breathlessness and chest pain and their levels of leisure-time physical activity., RESULTS: The surgically treated group displayed a mean weight loss of 28 kg (23%) compared with the control group in which the average weight remained unchanged (P<.001). The rates of hypertension, diabetes, and apneas during sleep decreased in surgical cases compared with controls (P<.001), while smoking habits remained largely the same. The surgical group also displayed highly significant improvements in dyspnea and chest pain and increases in physical activity compared with the control group (P<.001). The odds ratio for self-reported breathlessness, chest discomfort, or sedentary behavior after 2 years decreased progressively with the degree of weight loss. Furthermore, patients who recovered from apneas during sleep reduced their odds of having dyspnea and chest discomfort at follow-up, independent of changes in weight., CONCLUSIONS: Surgically induced weight loss in patients with severe obesity is associated with a marked relief in symptoms of dyspnea and chest pain and promotes increased leisure-time physical activity. Sleep-disordered breathing may be involved in the pathophysiology of breathlessness and chest discomfort in obese subjects."

In a case-control study we examined how sustained weight losses affect cardiac function and report on how body composition and fat distribution relate to the left ventricular performance., METHODS: At the 10-year follow-up of the Swedish obese subjects (SOS) study cohort we identified 44 patients with sustained weight losses after bariatric surgery (surgery group) and 44 matched obese control patients who remained weight stable (obese group). We also recruited 44 matched normal weight subjects (lean group). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, computed tomography and echocardiography were performed to evaluate body composition, fat distribution and cardiac function., RESULTS: BMI was 42.5 kg/m(2), 31.5 kg/m(2) and 24.4 kg/m(2) for the obese, surgery and lean groups respectively. Increasing degree of obesity was associated with larger left ventricular volumes (p < 0.001), higher cardiac output (p < 0.001), reduced systolic myocardial velocity (p<0.001) and impaired ventricular relaxation (p = 0.015). In multivariate analyses, left ventricular volume, stroke volume and cardiac output primarily associated with lean body mass, whereas blood pressure, heart rate and variables reflecting cardiac dysfunction were more related to total body fat and visceral adiposity., CONCLUSION: Obesity is associated with discrete but distinct disturbances in the left ventricular performance appearing to be related to both the total amount of body fat and degree of visceral adiposity. Patients with sustained weight losses display superior left ventricular systolic and diastolic functions as compared with their obese counterparts remaining weight stable.

Therefore, T2DM patients are at an increased risk for CV disease (CVD). Areas covered: This narrative review discusses the treatment of T2DM. This includes lifestyle measures (diet, exercise and smoking cessation) as well as hypolipidaemic, antihypertensive, weight reducing, antiplatelet and glucose lowering drugs. The focus is on the effects of these therapeutic strategies on CVD risk. Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) reporting CVD outcomes with such drugs in T2DM patients are also reviewed. Expert opinion: Apart from current guidelines, the findings of RCTs on CVD outcomes in T2DM patients should be taken into consideration in daily clinical practice. Multiple risk factors should be targeted simultaneously in such high-risk patients in order to efficiently reduce the risk of CV events.Copyright © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

It is not clear whether GAD antibody presence in obese patients with T2D affects diabetes remission, following bariatric surgery. Objective(s): We investigated the phenotype and diabetes outcomes after bariatric surgery, in this group of GAD antibody positive, T2D patients. Method(s): A recent randomised clinical trial compared silastic-ring Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in morbidly obese, T2D patients, in achieving diabetes remission. Of the 221 obese patients with T2D screened for eligibility, 13 GAD-positive patients were identified, 9 of whom proceeded with bariatric surgery, outside the clinical trial. Result(s): The 9 patients were aged between 44-55, with a mean duration of diabetes of 7.8 years, mean BMI of 43.8 (+/-SD 7.61kg/m2), and mean HbA1c of 58 (+/-SD 11.3mmol/mol), GAD ranging from 16-91 IU/ml. 2 patients were insulin treated prior to surgery; 6 required treatment for hypertension and/or dyslipidemia. 1 patient had a personal history of Graves's thyrotoxicosis, another had a familial history of T1D. Following surgery, at 1 year, diabetes medication was discontinued in all with achieved HbA1c between 29-53mmol/ mol. 3 of these had normalized GAD post-op, 2 had persisting GAD, 1 did not have this repeated.

"N. Kawahara, A. Koyaishi and A.

Since 2003, super-super obese (BMI460 kg/m2) patients have been operated with this technique at our local institution. Protein malnutrition and excess weight loss are still the biggest concern as potential complications. Usually, it has been performed for higher BMI. Our hypothesis was that a modified DS could be performed in bariatric patients with lower BMI to achieve good results and less complications. Our objective was to demonstrate that metabolic adapted DS is feasible and safe in lower bariatric BMI patients using an adaptation where we measure the whole small bowel, from the Treitz angle to the ileum-cecal valve and use the 50% of the whole small bowel as an alimentary limb and 25% of the as a common channel limb. Method(s): This was non randomized retrospective study. From January 2009 to December 2016, 30 patients were submitted to metabolic DS with 5 years of follow-up. Bariatric patients with BMI 35-40 were selected. Weight loss(WL) and nutritional status were verified. Laboratory measures to monitor pre-existing and post-procedure deficiencies, as well as post-operative vitamin and mineral supplementation were accessed. The duodenal-ileum anastomosis was evaluated annually by endoscopy. Result(s): 60% were men (18-60 y/o). Mean BMI was 372,3; Mean excess WL% was 36%2,10. Dyslipidemia was corrected in 100%. Diabetes remission occurred in 90%. Hypertension was resolved in 70%. Sleep apnea were cured in 100%. There were no nutritional or vitamin deficiencies. No stenosis or anastomotic ulcer were present. There was no mortality. Discussion(s): Our study has suggested that metabolic DS is an effective and safe operation for lower BMI with lower rates of complications, good long-Term WL and high patient satisfaction."

Its current prevalence (i.e., approximately 30%) is continuously increasing. MetS by itself is considered a risk factor for erectile dysfunction (ED)., AIM: To focus on the definition epidemiology, pathogenesis, and possible mechanistic links between MetS and ED in order to provide guidelines for treating such individuals., METHODS: The search strategies yielded total records screened from PubMed., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Regardless of the definition, MetS consists of insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity. MetS is not an end disease but is a disorder of energy utilization and storage., RESULTS: The prevalence of ED in patients with MetS is almost twice than in those without MetS, and about 40% of patients with ED have MetS. An important mechanism linking MetS and ED is hypogonadism., CONCLUSIONS: Recognizing through ED, underlying conditions such as hypogonadism, diabetes and MetS might be a useful motivation for men to improve their health-related choices. The clinical management of MetS can be done by therapeutic interventions that include lifestyle modifications, hormone replacement alone or in combination with phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, and other pharmacological treatments.

Materials Methods: Sixty patients undergoing LSG were recruited to participate in the study and randomized into either a LactoWise¨ or placebo group. The LactoWise¨ group (LWG) received 4.5 billion live cells of bacillus coagulans and galactomannans (300 mg); the placebo group received 600 mg of calcium citrate yielding 126 mg of elemental calcium. Both groups took their assigned capsule daily for 3_months post_surgery. Standard clinical lab values were measured pre_surgery and at 3_months post_surgery. Weight and blood pressures were measured at baseline, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months post_surgery. Results: A total of 35 patients with a mean age of 47.7 ± 12.4 years and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 46.6 ± 8.2 kg/m2 completed the study. There was a significant difference in BMI at baseline between the two study groups (43.0 ± 7.0 vs. 49.2 ± 8.3, P = .02). Weight loss was greater in the LWG compared to placebo at 6 weeks but showed no significant difference at 3 months post_op. In addition, there was a significant drop in triglycerides (TG) (P = .02) over time in the LWG (P = .01). The LWG had a significant decrease in AST and LDL compared to the placebo group (P = .03). Conclusion: Bariatric surgery (BS) produces positively impacting metabolic results in morbidly obese patients. Our study shows that in the case of triglycerides, LDL, weight loss and AST, administering of a probiotic/prebiotic blend may play a role in improving clinical outcomes of morbidly obese patients undergoing LSG."

As mid- to long-term effects of SAGB on weight and obesity-related comorbidities become available, a systematic review of the literature to summarize the available high quality data is required to direct future investigations and clinical practice. Method(s): A systematic literature review was conducted in PubMed/ Medline and Cochrane Database through September 2018 to identify RCTs which compared weight loss outcome, diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN) remission, and postoperative complications between SAGB and SG. Result(s): 3 RCTs encompassing 595 patients (297 SAGB patients and 298 LSG patients) were eligible to be enrolled into this meta-analysis. The longest follow-up was 5 years for 2 RCTs and 3 years for 1 RCT. Weight loss outcome was pooled based on percentage of total weight loss in 2 studies (significant in favor of SAGB) and percent excess weight loss in 2 studies (not significantly different). Moreover, while SAGB had a mild superiority in DM remission (effect size = 0.16, p = 0.02), the difference was not significant for HTN resolution (effect size = 0.17, p = 0.06). Postoperative adverse events were comparable between the 2 procedures (odds ratio = 0.80, p = 0.42). Conclusion(s): Findings of this meta-analysis suggest that SAGB is associated with more weight loss compared with SG. Furthermore, while SG has remarkable effects on DM and HTN, SAGB is associated with about 15% higher chance of remission for both comorbidities. Both procedures are comparably safe. Figure.

Moreover, metabolic surgery might carry an increased risk for liver decompensation and mortality in cirrhotic patients. We examined the prevalence of liver fibrosis and response to metabolic surgery. Aims & Methods: In a randomized controlled trial, baseline intraoperative needle liver biopsy was performed in 46 patients with VDD who underwent one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB). Patients were followed for 12 months for non-invasive FibroscanTM (FS) measures (M and XL probe) for the non-invasive detection of the presence of histologically advanced fibrosis and response to metabolic surgery as well as metabolic signatures and laboratory improvements. Univariate and multivariable analysis were used to test the predictive relevance of data assessed. Result(s): 78% of subjects were female, mean age was 42 (SD 12) years with a BMI of 44 (4) kg/m , a waist circumference of 128 (11) cm, and a HOMA index of 6.96 (5.81). 26% suffered from diabetes, 50% from hypertension, and 26% from hyperlipidemia. 72% demonstrated NASH, 11% simple steatosis, and 17% normal liver morphology. 30% showed significant fibrosis (F>=2), 9% advanced fibrosis (F3) and 4% cirrhosis (F4). (I) Metabolic surgery significantly improved BMI, waist circumference, HOMA Index, liver tests, and liver stiffness. Importantly, patients with F< 2 responded better. (adjusted for baseline value, age, sex, and diabetes mellitus). Of note, the groups (F< 2 vs. F>3) did not differ at baseline. (II) FS correlated significantly (r=0.516; p< 0.001) with histological fibrosis readings and showed an AUC of 0.738 (p=0.009) to predict F>=2 and an even better AUC 0.815 (p=0.015) for F>3. (III) Importantly, we observed a high variance in FS measurements (SD at baseline: 3.1 kPa, 1 months: 3.1 kPa, 3 months: 4 kPa, 6 months: 2.1 kPa, 12 months: 2.4 kPa,) before weight loss. Conclusion(s): (I) Metabolic surgery significantly improves liver stiffness, metabolic signatures and gamma-GT. Patients with fibrosis stage < 2 responded significantly better. (II) FibroscanTM is a useful tool to detect patients with F>=2, demonstrating highly variable measures before weight loss (until 3 months). Hence, suggesting critical evaluation during measurement and application of novel standards such as multiple region measurements to decrease sampling error and increase accuracy in morbidly obese patients. FibroscanTM is an important tool to preoperatively select patients for optimal outcome and potential risk of metabolic surgery."

We investigated the difference in respiratory variables according to the use of second_generation LMA and endotracheal tube (ETT) in laparoscopic living liver donor hepatectomy (LLDH). In this single_blind randomized controlled trial, intraoperative arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure at 2 h after the airway devices insertion (PaCO2_2h) was compared as a primary outcome. Participants were randomly assigned to the following groups: Group LMA (n_=_45, used Protector LMA), or Group ETT (n_=_43, used cuffed ETT). Intraoperative hemodynamic and respiratory variables including mean blood pressure (MBP), heart rate (HR), and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) were compared. Postoperative sore throat, hoarseness, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and pulmonary aspiration were recorded. The PaCO2_2h were equally effective between two groups (mean difference: 0.99 mmHg, P_=_0.003; 90% confidence limits:___0.22, 2.19). The intraoperative change in MBP, HR, and PIP were differed over time between two groups (P_<_0.001, P_=_0.015, and P_=_0.039, respectively). There were no differences of the incidence of postoperative complications at 24 h following LLDH (sore throat and hoarseness: P_>_0.99, PONV: P_>_0.99, and P_=_0.65, respectively). No case showed pulmonary aspiration in both groups. Compared with endotracheal tube, second_generation LMA is equally efficient during LLDH. The second_generation LMA can be considered as the effective airway devices for securing airway in patients undergoing prolonged laparoscopic surgery.

Magnesium sulfate has analgesic, sedative, and sympatholytic properties. This study examined the effects of intravenous magnesium 50 mg/kg administered before ESD for gastric neoplasm on analgesic and sedative consumptions during ESD and pain after ESD. METHODS: In this randomized, double_blind, and prospective study, patients undergoing ESD randomly received either intravenous magnesium sulfate 50 mg/kg (magnesium group n = 30) or the same volume of normal saline (control group n = 30) over 10 min before the start of sedation. Fentanyl consumption during ESD was the primary end point. Hemodynamics was recorded during the procedure, and abdominal pain was evaluated at 30 min, 6 h, and 24 h after ESD. RESULTS: During ESD, fentanyl consumption was 24% less in the magnesium group than in the control group (96 ± 27 vs. 126 ± 41 _g, mean ± SD; p = 0.002), although there was no significant difference in propofol consumption (p = 0.317). In addition, magnesium attenuated the elevation of mean blood pressure at the time of epinephrine submucosal injection (p = 0.038) and 5 min after submucosal dissection (p = 0.004). Less patients of the magnesium group compared to the control group requested for additional analgesics in the recovery room (14 vs. 38 %, p = 0.043), and the intensity of abdominal pain was lower at 30 min after ESD in the magnesium group (p = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: A single_dose intravenous administration of magnesium 50 mg/kg before sedation reduced analgesic requirements both during and after ESD for gastric neoplasm without adverse effects. In addition, magnesium contributed to stable hemodynamics throughout the procedure."

ARMMS-T2D is a multi-center consortium conducting a follow-up study of 4 merged RCTs in 256 patients with baseline Class 1-3 obesity and T2D, randomly assigned to metabolic surgery (MS; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, or gastric banding) or intensive Medical/Lifestyle Intervention (MLI). Three years after randomization, T2D remission rates were higher after MS than MLI (37.5%, 60/160 vs. 2.6%, 2/76, respectively, P<0.001). Adjusting for treatment allocation, baseline HbA1c, and T2D duration, the probability of remission with MS was 41.6% (95% CI, 29.6-58.3%) compared to 1% (95% CI, 0.2-4.0%) with MLI (P<0.001). MS patients experienced greater reductions than MLI in HbA1c (-1.9+/-2.0 vs. -0.1+/-2.0%, P<0.001) and fasting plasma glucose ( -52 [-105, 5] vs. -12 [-48, 26] mg/dL, P<0.001). Compared to MLI, MS patients had greater reductions in BMI (-22.0+/-9.4 vs. -4.8+/-7.9 kg/m2, P<0.001) and waist circumference (-17.5 +/-10.2 vs. -2.1+/-9.6 cm, P<0.001), greater increases in HDL-C (35.5+/- 27.6 vs. 9.1+/-24.1, P<0.001), greater reductions in triglycerides (-33[-52, -2] vs. -10 [-36, 14] P<0.001), and similar changes in LDL-C (9.5+/-41.5 vs. 4.2+/-31.6 mg/dL). MS and MLI rendered similar reductions in albumin/creatinine ratio (-2 [-13, 1] vs. 0 [-4, 4]) and eGFR (-3.1+/-16.7 vs. -4.6+/-19.5 mL/min/1.73 m2). Also, MS patients required fewer medications for diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia compared to MLI (P<0.001). In summary, this 3-year follow-up of the largest cohort of patients randomized to metabolic surgery vs. nonsurgical treatment demonstrates that surgery is more effective than intensive medical/lifestyle therapy in achieving extended diabetes remission, BMI reduction, and improved metabolic disease biomarkers while reducing medication requirements."

The Effects of If-Then Plans on Weight Loss: results of the McGill CHIP Healthy Weight Program Randomized Controlled Trial	2018	10.1002/oby.22226	CN-01646470	"OBJECTIVE: The NIH_developed Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) is successful in achieving clinically significant weight loss in individuals with overweight/obesity when delivered one_on_one. The group_based DPP is less effective, with average weight losses of only 3.5%. The objective of this study was to increase weight loss outcomes of the group_based DPP by integrating habit formation tools (i.e., if_then plans). This two_arm randomized controlled trial tested the efficacy of the habit formation_enhanced group_based DPP compared with the standard group_based DPP on changes in body weight (primary outcome). This study presents the 3_ and 12_month results of this 24_month trial. METHODS: A total of 208 participants were randomly assigned to the standard or enhanced DPP, and 172 participated. Participants were men and women with overweight/obesity who self_reported less than 200_min/wk of exercise. RESULTS: Both groups achieved high weight losses at 3 (5.76%) and 12 (9.98%) months, with no differences between groups (_2 _<_1). Both groups improved in blood pressure and physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: If_then plans did not result in higher weight loss. Both program versions resulted in higher weight loss than the group_based DPP. This may suggest that cognitive behavioral therapy skills of the coaches (clinical psychology doctoral students) was a key factor in treatment outcome."

The aim of this study is: To compare oral midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) versus oral clonidine (4 mug/kg) as a premedication in pediatric patients aged between 2_12 years with regard to sedation and anxiolysis. Materials and Methods: Eighty pediatric patients belonging to ASA class I and II between the age group of 2_12 years scheduled for elective urology surgery were randomly allocated to receive either oral midazolam (group I) 30 min before induction or oral clonidine (group II) 90 min before induction of anesthesia. The children were evaluated for levels of sedation and anxiety at the time of separation from the parents, venepuncture, and at the time of mask application for induction of anesthesia. %. We excluded patients with central nervous system disorders, obesity (weight >95 th percentile for age), gastrointestinal disorders that affect drug absorption, those on sedative medications, and those with previous reactions to clonidine or benzodiazepines. The children were randomly assigned to one of the two groups. Group I subjects received oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg (maximum of 15 mg) along with oral atropine 0.04 mg/kg,30 min before induction.Group II received oral clonidine4 mug /kg (maximum of 200 mug) along with oral atropine 0.04 mg/kg, 90 min before induction. Results and Discussion: After premedication, the percentage of children who were sedated and calm increased in both the groups. The overall level of sedation was better in the children in the clonidine group, but children in the midazolam group had a greater degree of anxiolysis at times of venepuncture and mask application. In addition, midazolam did not cause significant changes in hemodynamics unlike clonidine where a significant fall in blood pressure was noted, after premedication, but preinduction. Conclusion(s): However, clonidine with excellent sedative properties and other perioperative benefits like decrease in anesthetic requirements, reduced need for supplementary analgesics postoperatively, reduced incidence of shivering and postoperative vomiting, and decreased incidence of sevoflurane emergence agitation cannot be discounted as a viable alternative to midazolam in pediatric patients.. Clonidine with its sedative action especially at the time of separation from parents along with its other perioperative benefits cannot be discounted."
P. G. Kopelman	The effects of weight loss treatments on upper and lower body fat	1997			"The intra-abdominal visceral deposition of adipose tissue, which characterises upper body obesity, is a major contributor to the development of hypertension, glucose intolerance and hyperlipidaemia. Conversely, individuals with lower body obesity may have comparable amounts of adipose tissue but remain relatively free from the metabolic consequences of obesity. This raises an obvious question-are there particular weight reducing treatments which specifically target intra-abdominal fat? In theory, surgical removal of upper body fat should be effective. In reality, neither liposuction nor apronectomy ('tummy tuck') have any beneficial metabolic effects, they simply remove subcutaneous adipose tissue which is often rapidly replaced. Vertical banded gastroplasty and gastric bypass operations may be dramatically effective in improving blood pressure, insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. However, these benefits result from a parallel reduction in visceral and total body fat. Studies of body fat distribution in postmenopausal women confirm that the marked decrease in adiposity, following a programme of very low calorie diet and exercise, reflects a comparable reduction in visceral and thigh fat. The reduction in waist circumference after a low fat/exercise programme suggests a similar situation in men. Exercise has an important role in treatment but, once again, the fat loss is generalised. Nevertheless, the improved metabolic parameters seen in exercising obese subjects, independent of weight loss, suggest other beneficial actions. Growth hormone (GH) has a marked lipolytic action. GH replacement treatment for GH deficient adults with pronounced abdominal fat deposition, has been shown to reduce intra-abdominal fat by 47% compared to 27% decrease in abdominal subcutaneous fat. Similar beneficial actions on abdominal fat have been reported following treatment with testosterone in obese men. The potential hazards of such treatments make them unsuitable therapy for obesity. Dexfenfluramine is effective in reducing total body fat but the results from a six month randomised controlled trial indicates that it does not specifically influence changes in waist circumference associated with weight loss. In conclusion, any treatment which reduces total body fat will, by its nature, reduce intra-abdominal visceral fat. There are presently no specific treatments which can be recommended for intra-abdominal fat but increasing knowledge of the biochemical aberrations associated with visceral adiposity may lead to more specific therapies for the future."

Bariatric surgery profoundly reduces body weight and mitigates sequelae of obesity. The open, randomized controlled Wurzburg Adipositas Studie (WAS) trial compares the effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) vs psychotherapy-supported lifestyle modification in morbidly obese patients. The co-primary endpoint addresses 1-year changes in cardiovascular function (peak VO2 during cardiopulmonary exercise testing) and the quality of life (QoL) (Short-Form-36 physical functioning scale). Prior to randomization, all included patients underwent a multimodal anti-obesity treatment for 6-12 months. Thereafter, the patients were randomized and followed through month 12 to collect the primary endpoints. Afterwards, patients in the lifestyle group could opt for surgery, and final visit was scheduled for all patients 24 months after randomization. Sample size calculation suggested to enroll 90 patients in order to arrive at minimally 22 patients per group evaluable for the primary endpoint. Secondary objectives were to quantify changes in body weight, left ventricular hypertrophy, systolic and diastolic function (by echocardiography and cardiac MRI), functional brain MRI, psychometric scales, and endothelial and metabolic function. WAS enrolled 93 patients (72 women, median age 38 years, BMI 47.5 kg/m2) exhibiting a relevantly compromised exercise capacity (median peakVO2 18.3 mL/min/kg) and the QoL (median physical functioning scale 50). WAS is the first randomized controlled trial focusing on the effects of RYGB on cardiovascular function beyond hypertension. In addition, it will provide a wealth of high-quality data on the cerebral, psychiatric, hepatic, and metabolic function in obese patients after RYGB.Copyright © 2022 The authors Published by Bioscientifica Ltd."
"A. A. Koshy, A. M. Bobe and M. J. Brady"	Potential mechanisms by which bariatric surgery improves systemic metabolism	2013	https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trsl.2012.09.004		"Over the past several decades, excessive body weight has become a major health concern. As the obesity epidemic continues to expand, metabolic disorders associated with excess body weight, including type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, have exponentially increased. Dysregulation of satiety hormones and factors that regulate long-term energy storage can disrupt normal metabolic functions and lead to excess body fat. While diet and exercise seem to provide a logical means for weight loss, an unhealthy lifestyle coupled to responses initiated by perceived energy deficit impede sustained long term weight loss. Furthermore, because of the additional lack of effective pharmaceutical interventions to treat excess body weight, patients with severe obesity resort to bariatric surgery as an effective alternative for treatment of obesity and resolution of its associated comorbidities. Interestingly, the precise method by which bariatric surgery promotes rapid improvement in systemic metabolism and long-term weight loss remains incompletely understood and may vary between procedures. Multiple mechanisms likely contribute to the improved glucose metabolism seen after bariatric surgery, including caloric restriction, changes in the enteroinsular axis, alterations in the adipoinsular axis, release of nutrient-stimulated hormones from endocrine organs, stimulation from the nervous system, and psychosocial aspects including a dramatic improvement in quality of life. The current review will highlight the potential contribution of these responses to the improvement in systemic energy metabolism elicited by bariatric surgery. © 2013 Mosby, Inc.

Obesity is associated with hypertension, dyslipidemia and type II diabetes, which are the major predictors of cardiovascular disease in the future. It predisposes for atrial fibrillation, heart failure, sudden cardiac death, renal disease and ischemic stroke that are the main causes of cardiovascular hospitalization and mortality. As obesity and the cardiovascular effects on the vessels and the heart start early in life, even from childhood, it is important for health policies to prevent obesity very early before the disease manifestation emerge. Key roles in the prevention are strategies to increase physical exercise, reduce body weight and to prevent or treat hypertension, lipids disorders and diabetes earlier and efficiently to prevent cardiovascular complications. Epidemiology and mechanisms of obesity-induced hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia will be reviewed and the role of lifestyle modification and treatment strategies in obesity will be updated and analyzed. The best treatment options for people with obesity, hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia will discussed.Copyright © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."

In the review a newly developed system for treatment of subjects with type 2 diabetes and concomitant overweight/obesity is described. The system consists of an implantable pulse generator that delivers electrical stimuli through leads implanted in the sero-muscular layer of the stomach. The device recognises and automatically modulates natural electrical activity of the stomach during meals, strengthening gastric contractility. This increase in the force of contractions enhances vagal afferent activity. Modulated signals are transmitted to the regulatory centres in the brain in order to provoke an early response of the gut typical of a full meal. Clinical trials performed to date show that the system improves glycaemic control with minimal patient compliance needed and with added benefits of body weight loss, a decrease in blood pressure, and favourable changes in the lipid profile. The system is safe, well-tolerated, with a low risk of hypoglycaemia, and will probably become an alternative to the use of incretins or to bariatric surgery in obese patients who are unwilling to undergo a major and anatomically irreversible operation."
A. Krol	RA with us in obese patients	2014	https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/AAP.0000000000000142		"Summary: In this review obesity is to be defined in context of recent development in surgery and its mortality and morbidity, specifically bariatric surgery. Recent publications related to ultrasound guided regional anaesthesia in obese are discussed : peripheral nerve blocks and catheters, central neuraxial , lumbar plexus as well as chronic pain interventions. Principles of ultrasound imaging and way to improve the picture quality in obese patients are explained. Finally examples of ultrasound images in morbidly obese patients are presented and discussed. Introduction: Obesity has been defined as BMI (BodyMass Index) >30kg/m2 and morbid obesity as twice ideal body weight. In XXI century in developed countries pandemic of obesity has been observed. More than 1.4 billion adults, 20 and older, were over weight. Overall, more than 10% of the world's adult population was obese. Around 3.4 million adults die each year as a result of being overweight or obese. Culture of high calories fast food with decrease outdoor activities is about to blame. General mortality in obese population used to be twice as normal with increased risk of cardiac, pulmonary and metabolic complications.1 More recently bariatric surgery has become popular and attractive showing rapid improvement in metabolic condition such diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia even before measurable weight loss. National Bariatric Surgery Registry audit presented outcome after 8710 surgeries in the UK showing in - hospital mortality 1:1000 and overall complications about 2.6% .2 Overall 30 day mortality after elective procedures in the UK has been calculated as 6.7 per 1000 as presented by Aylin et al. 3 Obese patient present a challenge for an anaesthetist for both intraoperative and postoperative management. Beginning with pre-existing comorbidities such as sleep apnoea, pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, coronary artery disease , hypertension, diabetes mellitus through vascular access , difficult airway management, positioning to prevention of postoperative complications and adequate pain control. Regional anaesthesia solely or combined with general anaesthesia seems to be an attractive option in such demanding population both in avoiding general anaesthesia and reducing opioid consumption. However anatomical landmarks for regional anaesthesia are often of no use and even in expert hands failure rate is high. High Resolution Ultrasonography has become golden standard of regional anaesthesia over the last 20 years since the article by Kapral et al .4 describing ultrasound guided supraclavicular brachial plexus in 1994. Wallace et al. described indirect ultrasound guidance for epidural anaesthesia in obese pregnant patients back in 1992 5. Both papers have been a visionary work as resolution of ultrasound images were at the time very limited and enormous progress in this field has been made . PubMed search on 25.05.2014 using : "" obesity and ultrasound and regional anaesthesia"" revealed 13 publications. Three were in language other than English . Six were related to peripheral nerve blocks four to TAP block ( transversus abdominis plane block) in bariatric surgery, one to peripheral catheter insertion, chronic pain and central neuraxial respectively. Peripheral nerve blocks- single shot and catheters: In pre-ultrasound era Franco et al.6 reviewed retrospectively 2020 nerve stimulator guided supraclavicular blocks performed in their institution between February 1996 and April 2003. 455 blocks ( 22.5%) were performed in obese patients ( BMI> 30). Overall success rate in this subgroup was 94.3% (P<0.01) comparing to 97.3% in the non-obese population. Shroeder et al.7 analysed retrospectively 528 ultrasound guided interscalene block .They found that elevated BMI was associated with an increased time required for block performance , intra and post operative opioid administration, higher pain scores , as well as increased nausea and vomiting in PACU. Shwemmer et al. 8 assessed differences in success of ultrasound guided interscalene block between normal BMI 25 and excessive weight BMI > 25. Identification of nerve structures in obese group required more time 5 ( +- 1 min) comparing to patient of normal weight 4 ( +- 1 min)and was found difficult in 3 patients. Sufficient block was achieved in 94% of control and 77% of overweight group respectively but difference were not statistically significant . Mariano and Brodsky9 pulled out the data from 5 previously published randomised controlled trials comparing ultrasound and nerve stimulation guided perineural catheter insertion techniques. They identified 51 obese and 69 nonobese patients. All patients but one in non-obese group had successful catheter placement. 12 and 8 femoral catheters, 7 and 13 infraclavicular, 8 and 12 interscalene, 24 and 36 popliteal in obese and nonobese group respectively. Procedural time for catheter insertion were similar in both groups 7( 4-15 min) and served as a primary outcome. There were no statistical differences in secondary outcomes such as block efficacy, procedure related pain, fluid leakage, vascular puncture and catheter dislodgement. All above results should be interpreted cautiously. Firstly they present retrospective data with a bias of recording accuracy. Secondly criteria of primary and secondary outcome such as block effectiveness and procedure time or overall success differs among the studies. Thirdly they all come from centres of excellence experience with the techniques however difference in local population needed to be considered. Lastly there might be difference in procedure performance depending on the nerve/ plexus to be blocked ( e.g. interscalene v. sciatic) and BMI with minimal difference around 30 to significant in patient with BMI 40 and more. Further study are needed especially in subpopulation with morbid obesity but up to date result suggest that both ultrasound and nerve stimulator guided technique are useful tool in nerve location for single shot and catheter techniques."

Currently limited data are available regarding best strategies for treating VDD and the change of CVD risk factors after surgically induced weight loss, particularly, in bariatric patients undergoing omega-loop gastric bypass (OLGB). Therefore, we examined the change of CVD risk factors and its associations in a bariatric population during the first 12 months following OLGB. Method(s): A total of 50 bariatric patients recruited for a randomized controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation were included in this analysis. All patients were vitamin D insufficient or deficient due to the inclusion criterion at baseline (25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) < 75 nmol/l). All variables depicted in Tab.1, as well as medical history (e.g., comorbidities, prescribed medication) and body composition data from dual energy X-ray absorptiometry were included in the analysis. Result(s): Table 1 Evaluated CVD risk factors and its associations in vitamin D deficient morbidly obese patients during the first 12 months following OLGB In total, 80% were females with a mean age of 42 (13) years and BMI of 44 (4) kg/m2 at baseline. Significant changes could be observed in most of the CVD risk factors after 6 and 12 months (Tab. 1) towards a significant improvement except for diastolic blood pressure. The calculated Framingham 10-year CVD risk showed a significant reduction of 3% after 12 months. A reduction of 17% in the prevalence of diabetes mellitus could be found. Serum 25(OH)D concentration and total body fat-% (TBF%; r = -0.312, p = 0.001), weight loss-% (r = -0.407, p < 0.001), as well as waist circumference (r = -0.319, p < 0.001), were associated. HOMA-IR correlated with TBF% (r = 0.513, p > 0.001) and lean body mass-% (r = -0.511, p > 0.001). Conclusion(s): The present data indicates that OLGB induces a substantial improvement in CVD risk factors due to weight loss and its related effects in body composition during the first postoperative year. However, more research is needed to assess long-term effects of OLGB on CVD risk factors, additionally with the discrimination between VDD and those with sufficient VD-status."

Bariatric surgery improves CV risk [2], however data on Omega-Loop-Gastric-Bypass (OLGB) is lacking. Objective(s): The aim was to determine the impact of OLGB on CV risk factors in patients with (DM) and without (NDM) diabetes Typ II. Material/Methods: Within our randomized controlled trial [3], we prospectively evaluated the respective parameters preoperatively (T0) and 6 months postoperatively (T6). We used linear mixed model to assess effect of time and interaction for changes between DM and NDM (adjusted for baseline values, age, sex) and Pearson's correlation coefficient. Result(s): 45 patients [78% women, age 42(13)years, BMI 44(4)kg/m2, waist-circumference (WC) 129(10)cm] were analyzed. Following risk factors were present at T0 vs. T6: diabetes 29% vs. 21% (insulin units: 83IU vs. 25IU, p < 0.01), hyperlipidemia in NDM 19% vs. 12% and in DM 46% vs. 33%, and hypertension in NDM 34% vs. 24% and in DM 85% vs. 56% (NDM vs. DM: T0: p < 0.01, T6: n.s). In total, all CV risk factors decreased [WC, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDLc, cholesterol/ HDLc-ratio, lipoprotein(a), apolipoproteinB (apoB), apoB/apoA1-ratio, high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), HOMA2-insulin resistance (IR), systolic blood pressure (RRsys)] (Table 1). Significant group differences could be detected in weight loss, WC, triglycerides, apoA1, hsCRP, HOMA2-IR and group and time interaction in weight loss, HDLc, and ApoA1. Significant correlations were found between weight loss and RRsys (r = -0.353,p = 0.002), triglycerides (r = -0.346,p < 0.001), HDLc (r = 0,193, p < 0.001), cholesterol/HDLc-ratio (r = -0,321,p < 0.001), hsCRP (r = -0.297,p < 0.001), and HOMA2-IR (r = -0.545, p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): This evaluation highlights by decrease of WC, BMI, blood pressure, blood lipids, hsCRP, and insulin resistance the benefit of OLGB in reducing CV risk factors with group differences between NDM and DM.

Therefore, we assessed the change of known CVD risk factors and its associations during the first 12 months following one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB). Methods and Results: In this secondary analysis, CVD risk factors, medical history and anthropometric data were assessed in fifty VD deficient (25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D) <75 nmol/l) patients, recruited for a randomized controlled trial of VD supplementation. Based on previous results regarding bone-mass loss and the association between VD and CVD risk, the study population was divided into patients with 25(OH)D >=50 nmol/l (adequate VD group; AVD) and into those <50 nmol/l (inadequate VD group; IVD) at 6 and 12 months (T6/12) postoperatively. In the whole cohort, substantial remission rates for hypertension (38%), diabetes (30%), and dyslipidaemia (41%) and a significant reduction in CVD risk factors were observed at T12. Changes of insulin resistance markers were associated with changes of total body fat mass (TBF%), 25(OH)D, and ferritin. Moreover, significant differences in insulin resistance markers between AVD and IVD became evident at T12. Conclusion(s): These findings show that OAGB leads to a significant reduction in CVD risk factors and amelioration of insulin resistance markers, which might be connected to reduced TBF%, change in 25(OH)D and ferritin levels, as an indicator for subclinical inflammation, and an adequate VD status.

Successful patients are able to achieve durable weight loss and improve medical comorbidities. The association between digital support technologies and weight loss is less clear. We sought to determine if the Fitbit was associated with improved health outcomes in patients that are pursuing sleeve gastrectomy surgery. Method(s): In a randomized controlled trial of a bariatric post-surgical population over 4 years, study arms were: 1) control (standard of care); 2) intervention (provided with a Fitbit and software to monitor physical activity and standard of care); 3) historical (retrospective chart review of patients who previously completed follow-up). Excess weight loss percent (EWLP) was calculated and control and intervention participants completed an International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) at 1, 4, 8, and 12 months post-surgery. A survey evaluating comorbidities was completed at 12 months post-surgery. Result(s): The treatment group had higher EWLP than the control group by 0.38 (p = 0.57). Categorized IPAQ scores (high, medium, or low) were not significantly difference between groups (p = 0.81). Both the treatment and control groups saw improvements in comorbidities: diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and sleep apnea. The treatment group did not have a greater improvement in comorbidities (p = 1.0, 0.23, 0.19, 0.39). Conclusion(s): Tracking steps with a Fitbit did not have a significant effect on patient outcomes. Provision of fitness tracking devices may not provide any measurable benefit in bariatric patients without additional behavioral support and accountability for fitness tracking device outcomes."

Shimada"	Effects of Bariatric Surgery on Cardiovascular Disease: A Concise Update of Recent Advances	2019	https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2019.00094		"Patients with obesity often have multiple cardiovascular comorbidities as obesity is an established risk factor for various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)-e. g., heart failure (HF), coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, dysrhythmia, and venous thromboembolism. In the United States, obesity is the nationwide public health issue of the day with the prevalence exceeding 30%. It has become a substantial health and financial burden to the society and national healthcare system; the direct cost accounted for 150 billion US dollars in 2014. Lifestyle interventions have been shown to be successful in the short term, however their long-term results are still equivocal likely due to modest weight reduction and high recurrence rates. For instance, the mean weight reduction in a randomized controlled trial of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and either overweight or obesity was 6.0% in the intensive lifestyle modification arm and 3.5% in the control arm. On the contrary, bariatric surgery is known to be the most effective in achieving substantial and long-term weight loss and can prevent the development of CVD risk factors such as DM, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Bariatric surgery induces prompt weight loss within a few months which lasts for at least 12-18 months, with mean weight loss of ~35% (~70% loss of excess weight), lowering the risk of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Furthermore, recent studies demonstrated that bariatric surgery contributed to the reduction of acute care use for HF, CAD, and hypertension. On the other hand, it was reported that bariatric surgery may worsen the control of certain types of CVD (e.g., dysrhythmia), especially in the early postoperative period. Additionally, the notion that being overweight or obese could contribute to higher survival rate in certain populations (e.g., patients with HF)-also known as ""obesity paradox""-has been repetitively documented in the past, while most recent investigations suggested that the observed paradox may be attributable to confounding factors including pre-existing comorbidities. Considering the aforementioned advances in the field, this paper reviews a series of recent studies with regard to the short-term and long-term effects of bariatric surgery on various types of CVDs."

HTN seems to be the most common obesity-related health problem and visceral obesity seems to be the major culprit. Unfortunately, only 31% of hypertensives are treated to goal. This translates into an increased incidence of CVD and related morbidity and mortality. Several mechanisms have been postulated as the causes of obesity-related HTN. Activation of the RAAS, SNS, insulin resistance, leptin, adiponectin, dysfunctional fat, FFA, resistin, 11 Beta dehydrogenase, renal structural and hemodynamic changes, and OSA are some of the abnormalities in obesity-related HTN. Many of these factors are interrelated. Treatment of obesity should begin with weight loss via lifestyle modifications, medications, or bariatric surgery. According to the mechanisms of obesity-related HTN, it seems that drugs that blockade the RAAS and target the SNS should be ideal for treatment. There is not much evidence in the literature that one drug is better than another in controlling obesity-related HTN. There have only been a few studies specifically targeting the obese hypertensive patient, but recent trials that emphasize the importance of BP control have enrolled both overweight and obese subjects. Until we have further studies with more in-depth information about the mechanisms of obesity-related HTN and what the targeted treatment should be, the most important factor necessary to control the obesity-related HTN pandemic and its CVD and CKD consequences is to prevent and treat obesity and to treat HTN to goal.

R. F. Kushner and C. A. Noble	Long-term outcome of bariatric surgery: an interim analysis	2006			"With the increasing number of bariatric surgical procedures being performed, outcome assessment is of even greater importance. Few randomized, controlled prospective trials have compared bariatric surgery to nonsurgical weight-loss treatments, and the quality of current outcome data is suboptimal. However, the available evidence suggests that bariatric surgery, and particularly gastric bypass, is the most effective weight-loss treatment for people with extreme (class III) obesity. In addition to reduced energy intake and to a lesser extent malabsorption, numerous other potential mechanisms related to bariatric surgery may play a role in promoting weight loss and improving comorbidities. After bariatric surgery, clinical improvement or resolution has been reported in 64% to 100% of patients with diabetes mellitus, 62% to 69% of patients with hypertension, 85% of patients with obstructive sleep apnea, 60% to 100% of patients with dyslipidemia, and up to 90% of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. A wide range of other weight-related conditions also appear to improve, and limited data suggest that overall mortality may decrease in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Although not conclusive, evidence from available studies indicates that bariatric surgery is cost-effective. Further research with improved methodology is needed to define the mechanisms of action of bariatric surgery; to document its effect on long-term weight loss, comorbid conditions, and overall mortality; and to determine its cost-effectiveness."

Our objective was to estimate the risk of POCD associated with exposure to preoperative diabetes, hypertension, and obesity., METHODS: Original data from 3 randomised controlled trials (OCTOPUS, DECS, SuDoCo) were obtained for secondary analysis on diabetes, hypertension, baseline blood pressure, obesity (BMI >=30 kg/m2), and BMI as risk factors for POCD in multiple logistic regression models. Risk estimates were pooled across the 3 studies., RESULTS: Analyses totalled 1,034 patients. POCD occurred in 5.2% of patients in DECS, in 9.4% in SuDoCo, and in 32.1% of patients in OCTOPUS. After adjustment for age, sex, surgery type, randomisation, obesity, and hypertension, diabetes was associated with a 1.84-fold increased risk of POCD (OR 1.84; 95% CI 1.14, 2.97; p = 0.01). Obesity, BMI, hypertension, and baseline blood pressure were each not associated with POCD in fully adjusted models (all p > 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Diabetes, but not obesity or hypertension, is associated with increased POCD risk.

"C. Lam, L. Beltran-Agullo, J. Cheng, G. E. Trope and Y. M. Buys"	Effect of obesity on postural intraocular pressure changes	2014			"Purpose: The etiology of IOP increase in dependent body positions may be a shift in body fluid under gravity, causing increased episcleral venous pressure and choroidal vascular congestion. We hypothesized that this response is exaggerated in obesity. Method(s): This was a prospective, case control study enrolling 25 morbidly obese patients and 25 healthy, age- and gender-matched controls. Subjects had tonometry performed in 2 sets of positions, sitting and supine, with the order randomized. In the sitting position, IOP was measured with the neck in neutral position, flexion at 30degree, and extension at 30degree. In the supine position, IOP was measured in supine, right and left lateral decubitus, and with the head and upper body elevated at 30degree. The order of measurements within each set was also randomized. Result(s): Mean IOP in the obese group was significantly higher than the control group across each position (P<0.02), with a mean difference of 2.5+/-0.4 mmHg (P<0.0001). There was no difference in the magnitude of postural IOP change in the obese group compared to controls. There was no difference in mean IOP between the three neck positions while sitting within each group. There was a significant increase in IOP in supine, right and left lateral decubitus compared to sitting with head straight in both groups (P<0.05). Elevating the head 30degree in the supine position led to a significant decrease in IOP in the right eye only at 0 and 5 minutes in the obese group, and in both eyes at 5 minutes in the control group compared to the flat position. In the obese group, the dependent eye in right lateral decubitus had higher IOP at 0 minutes (P=0.02), but not at 5 minutes (P=0.14). This difference was not found in left lateral decubitus, or in either eye of the control group. Conclusion(s): Postural IOP change was a significant phenomenon in both our obese and normal weight subjects. While weight does not play a significant role in the magnitude of postural IOP change, higher IOP was demonstrated across all positions in the obese group. The results support epidemiological data showing an association between obesity and ocular hypertension. Future steps include measuring postural IOP in the same group following bariatric surgery to characterize the effect of weight loss on IOP."

They received single-bolus propofol (2 mg/kg) for intravenous induction of anesthesia based on either total body weight (TBW; 20 patients) or corrected body weight 60% (CBW60; 18 patients). Patients' characteristics, biochemical data, monitored bispectral index (BIS) values, and hemodynamic parameters were compared between the two groups., RESULTS: The propofol dose was significantly lower in the CBW60 group than in the TBW group (189.5 +/- 36.3 mg vs. 217.3 +/- 39.1 mg, respectively; p = 0.03). The highest BIS value, representing potential awareness after intubation, was relatively higher in the CBW60 group, but this difference was not statistically significant (CBW60 group, 53.6 +/- 11.1; TBW group, 48.6 +/- 8.1; p = 0.22). Eighty-three percent of patients experienced hypotension during induction and at least 44% patients showed marked hypotension. There was no significant difference between the TBW and CBW60 groups in blood pressure after intubation., CONCLUSION: When using single bolus propofol, the CBW60 group showed similar BIS values and hemodynamic effects as the TBW group during the intravenous induction of general anesthesia for obese patients.

C-IMT in the pooled surgery group reduced from [mean (95% confidence interval)] 0.81 (0.77-0.84) mm to 0.66 (0.63-0.69) mm, p < 0.001 [-17.1 (-20.4 to -13.8)%] at 1-2 months, and to 0.63 (0.59-0.66) mm, p < 0.001 [-21.8 (-25.3 to -18.4)%] at 12 months post-surgery. -C-IMT 1-2 months and 12 months post-surgery correlated to baseline C-IMT, and with -leptin at 1-2 months, but not at 12 months post-surgery. In linear regression analysis, -leptin and baseline C-IMT were predictors of -C-IMT 1-2 months post-surgery., CONCLUSIONS: A remarkable C-IMT regression occurred as early as 1-2 months after BS in obese patients either with or without type 2 diabetes, which was associated to the early reduction in leptin, (at least partially) independent of weight loss. Whether this is a causative or correlative association needs further investigation."

Fruhbeck"	Cardiovascular prevention in obese patients	2016	https://dx.doi.org/10.2174/1381612822666160822125834		"Background: The World Health Organization has emphasized that an increased body mass index (BMI) is a major risk factor for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) together with diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders and some cancers. The American Heart Association had already identified obesity as an independent risk factor in 1995. There is a significantly increased risk of CVD independently of other traditional risk factors (age, sex, physical activity, smoking, blood pressure and cholesterol levels) for patients fulfilling BMI criteria of moderate overweight, which increases with the diagnosis of obesity. Thus, both overweight and obesity are major risk factors for type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, and atherogenic dyslipidemia, among others. These diseases, when clustered, form the metabolic syndrome, a condition with exponential risk for CVD as compared with its isolated components. In this scenario, obesity emerges as a major public health challenge due to its huge clinical implications, taxing not only individuals but also health-care systems and society at large. Method(s): The present review focuses on: i) the link between dysfunctional fat excess and CVD; ii) the apparent controversies surrounding the obesity paradox as well as the concept of metabolically healthy obesity; iii) the known beneficial effects following weight loss; and iv) available strategies to treat obesity in order to ameliorate cardiovascular risk, which include lifestyle interventions, drug therapy, endoscopic and surgical procedures. Conclusion(s): Obesity is a highly heterogeneous disease that requires customized recommendations. Weight loss in different degrees is attainable via diverse procedures reducing morbidity and mortality while improving psychological well-being and social function. Therapeutic strategies should be tailored to the patient's characteristics and need a long-term personal commitment to change.Copyright © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers."

Intubation conditions after rocuronium or succinylcholine for rapid sequence induction with alfentanil and propofol in the emergency patient	2005	10.1017/s0265021505001249	CN-00530955	"Background and objective: Previous studies mainly conducted on elective patients recommend doses of 0.9_1.2 mg kg[_1] rocuronium to obtain comparable intubation conditions with succinylcholine 1.0 mg kg[_1] after 60 s during a rapid_sequence induction. We decided to compare the overall intubating conditions of standard doses of rocuronium 0.6 mg kg[_1] and succinylcholine 1.0 mg kg[_1] during a strict rapid_sequence induction regimen including propofol and alfentanil. Methods: Male and female patients (ASA I_III) older than 17 yr scheduled for emergency abdominal or gynaecological surgery and with increased risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastric content were randomized to a rapid_sequence induction with succinylcholine 1.0 mg kg[_1] or rocuronium 0.6 mg kg[_1]. Patients with a predicted difficult airway were excluded. A senior anaesthesiologist 'blinded' for the randomization performed the intubation 60 s after injection of the neuromuscular blocker. Intubating conditions were evaluated according to an established guideline. Tracheal intubation not completed within 30 s was recorded as failed. Results: 222 patients were randomized. Three patients had their operation cancelled and 10 did not fulfil the inclusion criteria. Clinically acceptable intubation conditions were present in 93.5% and 96.1% of patients in the succinylcholine group (n=107) and the rocuronium group (n=102), respectively (P=0.59). Conclusions: During a rapid_sequence induction with alfentanil and propofol, both rocuronium 0.6 mg kg[_1] and succinylcholine 1.0 mg kg[_1] provide clinically acceptable intubation conditions in 60 s in patients scheduled for emergency surgery. Under the conditions of this rapid_sequence induction regimen rocuronium may be a substitute for succinylcholine."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of malabsorptive procedures (Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass-LGBP & Duodenal Switch-DS) versus restrictive procedures (Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy-LSG) as it relates to percentage excess weight loss, postoperative complications & resolution of comorbidities. Method(s): A systematic review was conducted identifying all relevant studies from 2005 - 2015 with comparative data on malabsorptive and restrictive procedures. The primary outcome was percentage excess weight loss and postoperative complications (leaks, bleeding, strictures etc.).The secondary outcome was resolution of comorbidities (Diabetes Mellitus-DM, Hyperlipidemia-HLP, Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease-GERD & Hypertension-HTN). The results were analyzed as standard difference in means with standard error. Statistical analysis was done using random-effects meta-analysis to compare the mean value of the two groups (Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Version 3.3.070 software; Biostat Inc., Englewood, NJ). Result(s): Thirteen studies were quantitatively assessed and included for meta-analysis including one double-blind randomized controlled trial, two randomized controlled trials, three prospective studies and seven retrospective studies. There were a total of 3,035 LGBP patients, 155 DS patients, and 2006 LSG patients. Malabsorptive procedures were associated with greater %EWL (-0.070 +/- 0.03; p=0.02) and postoperative complications (2.03 +/- 0.07; p< 0.001) when compared to restrictive procedures. GERD demonstrated greater postoperative occurrence in restrictive procedures compared to malabsorptive procedures (-2.05 +/- 0.07; p< 0.001). Malabsorptive procedures were associated with greater resolution of comorbidities in terms of DM (0.87 +/- 0.07; p< 0.001), HLP (1.03 +/- 0.09; p< 0.001) & HTN (-0.48 +/- 0.65; p< 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Malabsorptive bariatric procedures yielded significantly higher percentage excess weight loss, rate of postoperative complications and resolution of comorbidities than restrictive procedures."

This study was carried out for 4 weeks and all related parameters were measured pre- and postsurgery in fasted obese diabetic Zucker rodents., RESULTS: Postoperatively, RYGB significantly decreased fasting blood glucose by 32% compared with ad lib. Plasma insulin and leptin levels were also found to be significantly decreased, by 66% and 38%, respectively, after surgery. Moreover, both glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY) were significantly increased after RYGB-by 300% and 51%, respectively. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels were also increased, but the increase was not statistically significant. Total cholesterol levels of the RYGB group remained unchanged for 4 weeks. However, total cholesterol in the ad lib and pair-fed groups increased by 25% and 34%, respectively, compared with initial levels. The cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio was decreased in the RYGB group by 14% and 30% compared with the ad lib and pair-fed group, respectively. The RYGB group had a significant decrease in aortic wall thickness of 25% compared with the ad lib and pair-fed groups. Similarly, the RYGB group had a 20-unit (mm Hg) decrease in systolic blood pressure compared with the presurgical value., CONCLUSION: RYGB has beneficial cardiometabolic effects through alterations in GI hormones in a severely obese and diabetic rodent model.

We perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate four modalities - intragastric balloon (IGB), endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG), duodeno-jejunal bypass liner (DJBL), and duodenal mucosa resurfacing (DMR), for their efficacy and safety on weight loss, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and metabolic syndrome. Method(s): Databases MEDLINE via PubMed, and EMBASE are searched and relevant publications up to January 26, 2022 are assessed. Studies are included if they involved human participants diagnosed with obesity and obesity-related comorbid conditions who are treated with any of the 4 EBMTs. IGB and DJBL were chosen as the interventions for the meta-analysis with weight loss (percentage total body weight loss or body mass index) and glycemic control (fasting plasma glucose or HbA1c) as the two main outcomes analyzed. Result(s): Six hundred and forty-eight records are reviewed, of which 15 studies are found to be duplicates. Of the 633 records screened, 442 studies are excluded. One hundred and ninety-one articles are assessed for eligibility, for which 171 are excluded. A total of 21 publications are included. Twelve studies are on IGB, two studies on ESG, five studies on DJBL, and two studies on DMR. In these studies with appropriate control, IGB, ESG, and DJBL showed promising benefits on weight loss reduction compared to standard medical therapy (SMT), while DMR appeared to have the least weight reduction benefit. However, the impact on glycemic control featured more prominently in DMR as compared to the rest of the modalities. Different EBMTs have different adverse effect profiles, although device-related adverse events are featured more prominently in DJBL. In the IGB group, there was a significant reduction in 6-month %TBWL [weighted mean difference (WMD) 5.45 (3.88, 7.05)] and FPG WMD -4.89 mg/dL (-7.74, -2.04) compared to the SMT group. There was no significant reduction in BMI between the DJBL and SMT group WMD -2.73 (-5.52, 0.07) kg/m2. Conclusion(s): EBMTs have demonstrated a significant impact on weight loss and metabolic comorbidities, and reasonable safety profiles in the studies reviewed. Some data is available to demonstrate reduction of hepatic steatosis, but there is no high-quality data supporting benefits on hepatic lobular inflammation or fibrosis.Copyright © 2022 Lee, Lai, Chua, Wang and Lee."

There is currently no consensus on which revisional procedure is best after an initial SG., OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety between single-anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass (SADI) or biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS) versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) as a revisional procedure for SG., SETTING: University Hospital, Canada., METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and PubMed were searched up to August 2018. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they compared SADI or BPD-DS with RYGB as a revisional bariatric procedure for SG. Primary outcome was absolute percentage of total weight loss. Secondary outcomes were length of stay, adverse events, and improvement or resolution of co-morbidities (diabetes, hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia). Pooled mean differences were calculated using random effects meta-analysis., RESULTS: Six retrospective cohort studies involving 377 patients met the inclusion criteria. The SADI/BPD-DS group achieved a significantly higher percentage of total weight loss compared with RYGB by 10.22% (95% confidence interval, -17.46 to -2.97; P=.006). However, there was significant baseline equivalence bias with 4 studies reporting higher initial body mass index (BMI) in the SADI/BPD-DS group. There were no significant differences in length of stay, adverse events, or improvement of co-morbidities between the 2 groups., CONCLUSION: SADI, BPD-DS, and RYGB are safe and efficacious revisional surgeries for SG. Both SADI and RYGB are efficacious in lowering initial BMI but there is more evidence for excellent weight loss outcomes with the conversion to BPD-DS when the starting BMI is high.

Obesity is the primary risk factor for the development of SDB and contributes to cardiovascular and metabolic abnormalities in this population. However, accumulating evidence suggests that SDB may be related to the development of these abnormalities independent of obesity. Periodic apneas and hypopneas during sleep result in intermittent hypoxemia, arousals, and sleep disturbances. These pathophysiologic characteristics of SDB are likely mechanisms underlying cardiovascular and metabolic abnormalities including hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases, altered adipokines, inflammatory cytokines, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance. Treatment of SDB with continuous positive airway pressure reverses some but not all of these abnormalities; however, studies to date have demonstrated inconsistent findings. Weight loss strategies, including diet, exercise, medications, and bariatric surgery, have been evaluated as a treatment strategy for SDB. In preliminary studies, dietary intervention and exercise reduced severity of SDB. One study demonstrated improvements in SDB severity using the weight-reducing medication sibutramine. In morbidly obese subjects, bariatric surgery effectively induces weight loss and improvement in SDB severity and symptoms, but long-term benefits remain uncertain. Large randomized trials are required to determine the utility of these strategies as long-term approaches to improving SDB and reducing associated complications."

OBJECTIVE(S): This article aims to familiarize physicians with the evaluation, management, and prevention of childhood. METHOD(S): A PubMed search was conducted in May 2021 in Clinical Queries using the key terms ""obesity"" OR ""obese"". The search included clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, case control studies, cohort studies, meta-analyses, observational studies, clinical guidelines, case reports, case series, and reviews. The search was restricted to English literature and children. The information retrieved from the above search was used in the compilation of the present article. RESULT(S): Most obese children have exogenous obesity characterized by a growth rate for height above the 50th percentile, normal intelligence, normal genitalia, and lack of historical or physical evidence of an endocrine abnormality or a congenital syndrome. Obese children are at risk for dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, obstructive sleep apnea, psychosocial disturbances, impaired quality of life, and shorter life expectancy. The multitude of serious comorbidities necessitates effective treatment modalities. Dietary modification, therapeutic exercise, and behavioral modification are the fundamentals of treatment. Pharmacotherapy and/or bariatric surgery should be considered for obese individuals who do not respond to the above measures and suffer from a serious comorbid condition. CONCLUSION(S): Childhood obesity, once established, is often refractory to treatment. Most treatment programs lead to a brief period of weight loss followed by rapid re-accumulation of the lost weight after termination of therapy. As such, preventive activity is the key to solve the problem of childhood obesity. Childhood obesity can be prevented by promoting healthy diet, regular physical activity, and lifestyle modification. Parents should be encouraged to become involved in school and community programs that improve nutritional status and physical activity in their children.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."

Our meta-analysis aims to provide an updated comparison between laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic greater curvature plication (LGCP). Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, and Cochrane Central were searched. Ongoing clinical trials were identified from the clinicaltrials.gov website. References of the chosen literatures were manually reviewed for additional relevant studies. As a result, a total of 18 studies involving 1329 patients were selected. We demonstrated a significant higher excess weight loss (%EWL) after LSG at the 1-, 3-, 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-up time points. However, no significant difference was found at 36 months. Body Mass Index Loss (BMIL) was better after LSG than LGCP at 12 and 24 months. The difference in the improvement of comorbidities (i.e., T2-DM, hypertension, and sleep apnea) did not reach statistical significance. The complications (i.e., bleeding, stenosis, leak, and abdominal pain), operative time, and length of hospital stay were comparable. More patients undergoing LGCP experienced nausea and vomiting. We obtained some different and new results compared to the previously published meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis showed significantly higher %EWL at 24 months (Z=2.08, p=0.04), significantly higher BMIL at 36 months (Z=9.11, p <0.00001), and significantly higher costs (Z=2.87, p=0.004) in the LSG group. In addition, for the first time, complications (i.e., GERD, wound infection, port-site hernia, and mortality) and improvement of dyslipidemia were compared between the two techniques. According to our pooled data, no significant differences were found in any of the above aspects. In conclusion, LSG is superior to LGCP with regard to providing effective weight loss in the short- and mid-term. LSG has a lower rate of minor complications, but was less effective when considering cost. The two procedures are similar in terms of improvement of comorbidities, major complications, operative time, and length of stay. Copyright © 2021.

Zhang"	Development of Bariatric and Metabolic Endoscopy	2018	https://dx.doi.org/10.4103/0366-6999.221283		"Objective: With the evolution of society and changes in human lifestyle, obesity is becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide, and obesity-related comorbidities such as diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and coronary heart disease are more common. As a result, new devices and methods for bariatric and metabolic endoscopy are being developed for clinical use, offering new options for patients. This review discussed the progress in bariatric and metabolic endoscopy. Data Sources: This review was based on data in articles published in the PubMed database up to September 2017, with the following keywords: 'obesity', 'endoscopy', 'weight loss', and 'metabolism'. Study Selection: Original articles about various endoscopic methods of weight loss and other reviews of bariatric and metabolic endoscopy were included and analyzed. Result(s): The technology of bariatric and metabolic endoscopy has advanced rapidly in recent years. The intragastric balloon (IGB), with its comparatively long period of development, is the most mature and widely used instrument. Multiple new endoscopic devices have been created in recent years, with different targets to achieve weight loss. Despite the proliferation of new devices, the lack of clinical data results in a shortage of clinical experience and instruction in the use of this new equipment. Conclusion(s): Bariatric and metabolic endoscopy would help obese people lose weight or prepare for bariatric surgery and hopefully alleviate some of the complications of bariatric procedures. Adequate studies and data are still needed for the new endoscopic devices."

Demographic characteristics, metabolic parameters and cardiac structure/function along with inflammatory cytokines were measured and compared before and after 12 months., RESULTS: At 12 months, diabetes remission had occurred in no patients in groups A and B versus 90% in group C, and there was a significant decrease in requirement of antihypertensive drugs in group C compared with groups A and B (P<0.05). Other parameters (body mass index, hemoglobin A1c, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, lipids), inflammation index (high sensitivity C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, high molecular weight adiponectin) and cardiac structure (left ventricular mass index) were significantly improved in groups B and C, but patients in group C had the greatest degree of improvement (P<0.05)., CONCLUSION: RYGB surgery improves a number of parameters including cardiovascular function in obese hypertensive people with T2DM. This is likely to be due to, at least in part, an improvement in the abnormal metabolic panel and to reduced inflammation. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."

Controlled hypertension under hemostasis prevents post-gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection bleeding: a prospective randomized controlled trial	2021	10.1007/s00464-020-08256-2	CN-02246854	"Background: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a prominent minimally invasive operative technique for treating early gastrointestinal tumors but can result in postoperative bleeding. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine whether increasing blood pressure under hemostasis during gastric ESD to identify potential bleeding spots reduces the risk of post_ESD bleeding. Methods: In this randomized, controlled, single_blinded clinical trial, 309 patients with early gastric cancer who were admitted to a hospital to undergo ESD were recruited from March 2017 to February 2018 and were randomized into intervention and control groups. In the control group, patients underwent normal ESD. In the intervention group, we increased patientsÕ blood pressure to 150 mmHg for 5 min using a norepinephrine pump (0.05 _g/kg/min initial dose) after the specimen was extracted during the ESD operation to identify and coagulate potential bleeding spots with hot biopsy forceps. Our primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative bleeding over 60_day follow_up. Results: The incidence of post_ESD bleeding was lower in the intervention group (1.3%, 2/151) than in the control group (10.1%, 16/158, p = 0.01). Deeper tumor invasion was associated with a higher risk of post_ESD bleeding (5.3% in mucosal/submucosal layer 1 group vs. 12.5% in submucosal layer 2/muscularis propria group, p < 0.001). Multi_factor but not univariate analysis showed that proton pump inhibitor administration three times per day may be a better choice than twice per day. Conclusion: Increasing blood pressure under hemostasis during ESD to identify and coagulate potential bleeding spots could reduce the risk of delayed bleeding after gastric ESD."

POD may be affected by different fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of different FiO2 on POD. Patients and Methods: A randomized, double_blind controlled trial was performed in Qingdao Municipal Hospital Affiliated to Qingdao University. A total of 662 patients aged 65 to 85 years old underwent isolated laparoscopic radical gastrectomy, radical resection of colon cancer, or radical resection of rectal cancer only. A random number table method was used to divide the patients into two groups: 40% FiO2 (group A) and 80% FiO2 (group B). The primary endpoint was the incidence of POD, which was assessed by the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) twice daily during the first 7 postoperative days, and POD severity was measured by the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS). The secondary endpoints were the intraoperative regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2), Bispectral (BIS) index, invasive arterial blood pressure (IABP), oxygen saturation (SpO2), end_tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure (PETCO2), the number of atelectasis cases and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores on days 1_7 after surgery. Results: The incidence of POD was 19.37% (122/630), including 20.38% (64/314) in group A and 18.35% (58/316) in group B. No statistical significance was found in the incidence of POD between the two groups (P > 0.05); compared with group B, SpO2, rSO2 and PaO2 decreased at T2 to T4 time point (P < 0.01), and the incidence of postoperative atelectasis decreased (P < 0.05) in group A. Conclusion: The incidence of POD was not significantly affected by different FiO2 and the incidence of postoperative atelectasis was decreased at low FiO2."

METHODS: Thrity patients (60 approximately 75 years) undergoing elective noncardiac surgery were randomly divided into a metoprolol group (n = 15) and a control group (n = 15). In the metoprolol group, metoprolol (0. 5 mg and 1.5 mg) was slowly injected into the vein of patients before the induction of intravenous anesthesia and after the tracheal intubation. The hemodynamic indice (invasive BP, HR and rate pressure product_RPP), the myocardial ischaemia indice (reversible ST segment depression of ECG II, V5 leads more than 0.1 mv or reversible ST segment elevation more than 0.2 mv from the baseline, ST segment depression or elevation over 1 min), the myocardial damage indice (serum cardiac troponin I, cTn I), and the indice of metoprolol cardiac and the respiratory adverse effects (incidence of HR below 50 beats/min, average doses of atropine, airway peak pressure) were observed intraoperatively. RESULTS: The HR and RPP were lower before the tracheal induction than the baseline (before anesthesia) in all patients, but there is no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). During the tracheal intubation, the HR and RPP of the control group significantly increased, compared with the baseline (P < 0.05) and those of metoprolol group (P < 0.05). The incidence of perioperative hypertension was higher in the control group than that in the metoprolol group. The incidence of myocardical ischaemia episode was 30% in the control group, and 13% in the metoprolol group (P < 0.01). The release of cTn I was detected in 5 patients in the control group, and 2 patients in the metoprolol group (P < 0.05). The incidence of HR < 50 beats/min, and the average doses of atropine had no statistic difference between the two groups, but a tendency of high incidence of bradycardia in the metoprolol group occurred when abdominal viscera was tracted by surgical manupilation. There was no significant difference in airway peak pressure, SpO2 and PET CO2 between the two groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Intravenous administration of 0.5 mg and 1. 5 mg metoprolol before the induction of anesthesia and after the tracheal intubation has several advantages, including the decrease of myocardial oxygen consumption, the improvement of hemodynamic stability, and the lowering perioperative incidence of myocardial ischeamia and damage, but the tendency of high bradycardia incidence caused by peritoneal traction should be noticed."
E. H. Livingston	Obesity and its surgical management	2002			"Obesity is increasing in epidemic proportions world-wide. Even mild degrees of obesity have adverse health effects and are associated with diminished longevity. For this reason aggressive dietary intervention is recommended. Patients with body mass indices exceeding 40 have medically significant obesity in which the risk of serious health consequences is substantial, with concomitant significant reductions in life expectancy. For these patients, sustained weight loss rarely occurs with dietary intervention. For the appropriately selected patients, surgery is beneficial. Various operations have been proposed for the treatment of obesity, many of which proved to have serious complications precluding their efficacy. A National Institutes of Health Consensus Panel reviewed the indications and types of operations, concluding that the banded gastroplasty and gastric bypass were acceptable operations for treating seriously obese patients. Surgical treatment is associated with sustained weight loss for seriously obese patients who uniformly fail nonsurgical treatment. Following weight loss there is a high cure rate for diabetes and sleep apnea, with significant improvement in other complications of obesity such as hypertension and osteoarthritis."

We present efficacy and safety findings at 12 months post_coupler insertion. This open_label, multicenter, prospective, randomized trial enrolled patients with a baseline office systolic BP ³140 mm_Hg and average daytime ambulatory BP ³135/85 mm_Hg. Subjects were randomly allocated to coupler implantation and continuing previous pharmacotherapy or to maintain previous treatment alone. At 12 months, 39 patients who had coupler therapy were included in the intention_to_treat analysis. Office_based systolic BP reduced by 25.1±23.3 mm_Hg (baseline, 174±18 mm_Hg; P<0.0001) post_coupler placement, and office diastolic BP reduced by 20.8±13.3 mm_Hg (baseline, 100±13 mm_Hg; P<0.0001). Mean 24_hour ambulatory BP reduced by 12.6±17.4/15.3±9.7 mm_Hg (P<0.0001 for both). In a prespecified subset of patients who failed to respond adequately to prior renal denervation, coupler therapy led to highly significant reduction in office systolic/diastolic BP (30.7/24.1 mm_Hg) and significant reduction in 24_hour ambulatory systolic/diastolic BP (12.4/14.4 mm_Hg) at 12 months (n=9). After coupler therapy, 14 patients (33%) developed ipsilateral venous stenosis; all were treated successfully with venous stenting.

We assessed the safety and efficacy of a central iliac arteriovenous anastomosis to alter the mechanical arterial properties and reduce blood pressure in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. METHODS: We enrolled patients in this open_label, multicentre, prospective, randomised, controlled trial between October, 2012, and April, 2014. Eligible patients had baseline office systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher and average daytime ambulatory blood pressure of 135 mm Hg or higher systolic and 85 mm Hg or higher diastolic despite antihypertensive treatment. Patients were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to undergo implantation of an arteriovenous coupler device plus current pharmaceutical treatment or to maintain current treatment alone (control). The primary endpoint was mean change from baseline in office and 24 h ambulatory systolic blood pressure at 6 months. Analysis was by modified intention to treat (all patients remaining in follow_up at 6 months). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01642498. FINDINGS: 83 (43%) of 195 patients screened were assigned arteriovenous coupler therapy (n=44) or normal care (n=39). Mean office systolic blood pressure reduced by 26á9 (SD 23á9) mm Hg in the arteriovenous coupler group (p<0á0001) and by 3á7 (21á2) mm Hg in the control group (p=0á31). Mean systolic 24 h ambulatory blood pressure reduced by 13á5 (18á8) mm Hg (p<0á0001) in arteriovenous coupler recipients and by 0á5 (15á8) mm Hg (p=0á86) in controls. Implantation of the arteriovenous coupler was associated with late ipsilateral venous stenosis in 12 (29%) of 42 patients and was treatable with venoplasty or stenting. INTERPRETATION: Arteriovenous anastomosis was associated with significantly reduced blood pressure and hypertensive complications. This approach might be a useful adjunctive therapy for patients with uncontrolled hypertension. FUNDING: ROX Medical."

The aim of the study was to investigate whether the ulrashort_acting opioid remifentanil provide better cardiovascular and humoral response control than fentanyl during and after total gastrectomy in elderly parient. Methods: A total of 60 patients aged over 65 years (ASA II calssification) were randomised in two equal groups to receive remifentanil (0.1 _ g/kg continuous iv infusion) or fentanyl (1.5 _ g/kg iv bolus), as analgesic part of general balanced anaesthesia and continued postoperatively. The values of cardiovascular parameters _ blood pressure and heart rate and level of cortisol, glicemia was measured at six points in time: baseline value_before inducion in anaesthesia (0), after intduction (1), two minutes after intubation (2), after manipulation with abdominal organs (3), after extubation (4), after 12 h and 24 h postoperatively (5,6). Results: After induction of anaesthesia, a greater decrease of systolic pressure was found in the remifentanil group (32% ± 5 vs. 25 ± 4%). However, in the same group after the intubation of trachea a smaller increase of systolic pressure was registered (16% vs. 33%). Systolic blood pressure was less incressed during the phase of extubation in fentanyl group (24%). Diastolic pressure was significantly higher during the phase of extubation in fentanyl group. After induction in anaesthesia, a significant fall in diastolic blood pressure was found in remifentanil group Levels of cortisol were increased after extubation, but significantly more in the remifentanil group. Level was significantly increased after 12 h of the operation in the both groups. After 24 h was increased but not significantly. Glycaemia was without changes after intubation. After first incision and during procedure. Glucose level was significantly increased in phase of tracheal extubation only in remifentanil group. During the postoperative period was within the normal values in both groups. Conclusions: Fentanyl assured better cardiovascular and humoral stability than remifentanil in elderly gastrectomised patients."

The behavior of these indicators in bariatric patients with weight recidivism is unknown. We aimed to investigate both profiles in bariatric patients with high ratio of weight regain (RWR), comparing them with nonsurgical patients with obesity., METHODS: Forty patients with obesity subjected to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) with high RWR composed the bariatric group, and 40 controls matched for BMI, age, and gender were recruited as nonsurgical group. Between-group comparisons were performed for clinical history, physical examination, biochemical, metabolic, and inflammatory profiles., RESULTS: Bariatric group was composed of a group with an excess weight loss of 85.9 +/- 16.8%, a RWR of 56.5 +/- 19.7%, and a time since surgery of 10.7 +/- 4.3 years. We noticed a lower proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia (P <= 0.05) and lower neck and waist circumferences (P <= 0.05) in this group. No differences between groups were observed concerning hip circumference, blood pressure, heart rate, total cholesterol, LDL-c, acid uric, creatinine, ALT, ASP, interferon-gamma (INF-gamma), interferon gamma-induced protein-10 (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), TNF-alpha, interleukin-1beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-17 (IL-17), and interleukin-10 (IL-10). Of note, fasting glucose; HbA1c; triglycerides; and, surprisingly, IL-6 levels were lower (P <= 0.05) in the bariatric group than nonsurgical one while HDL-c level was higher (P < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: Expressive post-bariatric weight loss, even in patients with high RWR, suggests a possible metabolic benefit/protection in the long term.

The objective of this study was to compare the effect of one against two meal replacement strategies on body composition and cardiovascular risk parameters in patients with obesity., METHODS: A randomized clinical trial was designed with a modified hypocaloric diet with an artificial nutritional preparation replacing one or two meals for three months in patients with obesity and osteoarthritis pending orthopedic surgery. An anthropometric evaluation and a measurement of the body composition were done with bioelectrical impedance measurement at the beginning and at three months., RESULTS: A total of 112 patients were recruited. Fifty-two patients (46.4%) were randomized to one replacement and 60 patients (53.6%) to two meal replacements. Eighty-one patients (72.3%) were women, and the average age was 61 (11.03) years. The percentage of weight loss at three months was 8.27 (4.79)% (one meal replacement: 7.98 (5.97)%; two meal replacements: 8.50 (3.48)%; p = 0.56).

Thus, an advanced hemodynamic monitoring including continuous cardiac index (CI) assessment is desirable. While invasive catheterization may bear technical difficulties, transesophageal echocardiography is contraindicated due to the surgical procedure. Evidence on the clinical reliability of alternative semi- or non-invasive cardiac monitoring devices is limited. The aim was to compare the non-invasive vascular unloading to a semi-invasive pulse contour analysis reference technique for continuous CI measurements in bariatric surgical patients., METHODS: This prospective observational study included adult patients scheduled for elective, laparoscopic bariatric surgery after obtained institutional ethics approval and written informed consent. CI measurements were performed using the vascular unloading technique (Nexfin R) and semi-invasive reference method (FloTrac TM). At 10 defined measurement time points, the influence of clinically indicated body posture changes, passive leg raising, fluid bolus administration and pneumoperitoneum was evaluated pre- and intraoperatively. Correlation, Bland-Altman and concordance analyses were performed., RESULTS: Sixty patients (mean BMI 49.2 kg/m2) were enrolled into the study and data from 54 patients could be entered in the final analysis. Baseline CI was 3.2 +/- 0.9 and 3.3 +/- 0.8 l/min/m2, respectively. Pooled absolute CI values showed a positive correlation (rs = 0.76, P < 0.001) and mean bias of of - 0.16 l/min/m2 (limits of agreement: - 1.48 to 1.15 l/min/m2) between the two methods. Pooled percentage error was 56.51%, missing the criteria of interchangeability (< 30%). Preoperatively, bias ranged from - 0.33 to 0.08 l/min/m2 with wide limits of agreement. Correlation of CI was best (rs = 0.82, P < 0.001) and percentage error lowest (46.34%) during anesthesia and after fluid bolus administration. Intraoperatively, bias ranged from - 0.34 to - 0.03 l/min/m2 with wide limits of agreement. CI measurements correlated best during pneumoperitoneum and after fluid bolus administration (rs = 0.77, P < 0.001; percentage error 35.95%). Trending ability for all 10 measurement points showed a concordance rate of 85.12%, not reaching the predefined Critchley criterion (> 92%)., CONCLUSION: Non-invasive as compared to semi-invasive CI measurements did not reach criteria of interchangeability for monitoring absolute and trending values of CI in morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery., TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered retrospectively on June 12, 2017 with the registration number NCT03184272 ."

Importantly, there are limited data on therapeutic strategies for vitamin D deficiency in bariatric patients, and the procedure-specific guidelines may not be sufficient. To improve long-term outcomes, nutritional screening and appropriate supplementation to prevent nutrient deficiencies are urgently needed. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine effects and safety of a forced dosing regimen of vitamin D versus conventional dose supplementation on vitamin D levels and other parameters in bariatric patients., METHODS/DESIGN: The study includes loading plus repeat dosing compared with repeated administration of vitamin D without a loading dose, according to guidelines, in a prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Up to a triple oral loading dose is given on day 1, then 2 and 4 weeks after surgery (100,000 IU dose each time), followed by an oral maintenance dose (3420 IU/day). The control group (n = 25) will receive placebo, followed by administration of a standard dose (3420 IU/day). We hypothesize that a significant increase in vitamin D levels will occur in patients in the treatment group (n = 25) by 24 weeks after surgery. Further measurements are aimed at evaluating changes in inflammation, bone turnover, insulin resistance, blood pressure, liver, mental health, and gut microbiota of patients undergoing omega-loop gastric bypass surgery. Furthermore, possible associations between concentrations of vitamin D, the involved enzymes, or vitamin D receptor in adipose and/or liver tissues will be determined., DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this trial is the first of its kind with this type of vitamin D supplementation in bariatric patients. Its major strength is the design and implementation of evaluation of influencing factors such as liver function, bone health, inflammation, insulin resistance, blood pressure, symptoms of depression, or microbiota. This alternative vitamin D dosing regimen has the potential to be a safe, fast, evidence-based treatment of vitamin D deficiency in bariatric patients. Owing to the increasing number of bariatric patients, it is also of interest to elucidate the link between obesity and vitamin D., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02092376 .

Diagnosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) requires liver biopsy. We estimated the prevalence of NASH and fibrosis in morbidly obese patients. Method(s): In this randomized controlled trial (NCT02092376) liver biopsy was performed at the time of bariatric surgery and Bedossa's SAF (Steatosis, Activity, Fibrosis) score was used for categorizing liver lesions1. Additionally, total body fat content by dual-energy-absorptiometry and serum liver enzymes were examined. Result(s): 35 patients [71% women, age 43(13) years, mean(SD)] with a BMI of 44.1(4.7) kg/m2, waist circumference (WC) of 128.2(11.0) cm, and total body fat of 42.8(7.0)%, were analyzed. The following risk factors were present: diabetes 26%, hyperlipidemia 23%, and hypertension 43%. Moreover, 80% had some degree of steatosis (S>=1), 77% had NASH (A>=2), 31% demonstrated significant liver fibrosis (F2-F3), and 6% had cirrhosis (F4). Total body fat and diabetes were significantly associated with fibrosis (r=-0.543, p = 0.001 and r=0.584, p = 0.001). WC was related to degrees of steatosis (r=0.363, p = 0.01). Furthermore, patients with NASH compared to those without had significantly higher alanine transaminase (ALAT) levels [40.6(21.4) vs. 21.3(6.8) U/l, p = 0.001]. Conclusion(s): In this study, NASH and significant liver fibrosis are present in a high percentage of morbidly obese patients. Fibrosis and steatosis seem to be associated with total body fat, diabetes and WC. Furthermore, patients suffering from NASH demonstrated higher levels of ALAT."

Endoscopic resection has been the preferred method for treating gastric polyps since the late 1960s. Surgical removal of polyps continues to play an important role in the treatment of polyps; however, the efficacy of such treatment cannot be guaranteed, and polyps may recur. Case presentation: Here, we report a 44_year_old man suffering from gastrointestinal polyps who refused surgical treatment and instead was treated with traditional Chinese herbal medicine (TCHM) for approximately 1 year. The patient was diagnosed with Òqi deficiency and dampness syndromeÓ based on traditional Chinese medicine theory and was treated with the TCHM Òstrengthen qi and remove dampness formulaÓ, referred to as the shen_ling_bai_zhu powder/decoction. Conclusion: This case suggests that TCHM may play an important role in the treatment of gastrointestinal polyps. Relevant data are, however, limited and a randomized controlled trial is needed to confirm TCHM efficacy in a larger population."

Higa"	Revisional Bariatric/Metabolic Surgery: What Dictates Its Indications?	2016	https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11883-016-0592-3		"Bariatric/metabolic surgery is currently the only effective long-term treatment for morbid obesity- and obesity-related diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and dyslipidemia. In addition, bariatric/metabolic surgery has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of diabetes and cancer and prolong life when compared to non-surgical therapies. However, as obesity is a chronic disease, recidivism of weight and comorbid conditions can occur. In addition, the surgical construct can lead to long-term consequences such as marginal ulceration, bowel obstruction, reflux, and nutritional deficiencies. Despite these drawbacks, prospective randomized controlled studies and long-term longitudinal population-based comparative studies greatly favor surgical intervention as opposed to traditional lifestyle, diet, and exercise programs. Revisional surgery can be quite complex and technically challenging and may offer the patient a wide variety of solutions for treatment of weight recidivism and complications after primary operations. Given the paucity of high quality published data, we have endeavored to provide indications for revisions after bariatric surgery.Copyright © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Single-component versus multicomponent dietary goals for the metabolic syndrome: a randomized trial	2015	10.7326/M14-0611	CN-01052336	"BACKGROUND: Few studies have compared diets to determine whether a program focused on 1 dietary change results in collateral effects on other untargeted healthy diet components. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a diet focused on increased fiber consumption versus the multicomponent American Heart Association (AHA) dietary guidelines. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial from June 2009 to January 2014. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00911885). SETTING: Worcester, Massachusetts. PARTICIPANTS: 240 adults with the metabolic syndrome. INTERVENTION: Participants engaged in individual and group sessions. MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcome was weight change at 12 months. RESULTS: At 12 months, mean change in weight was _2.1 kg (95% CI, _2.9 to _1.3 kg) in the high_fiber diet group versus _2.7 kg (CI, _3.5 to _2.0 kg) in the AHA diet group. The mean between_group difference was 0.6 kg (CI, _0.5 to 1.7 kg). During the trial, 12 (9.9%) and 15 (12.6%) participants dropped out of the high_fiber and AHA diet groups, respectively (P = 0.55). Eight participants developed diabetes (hemoglobin A1c level ³6.5%) during the trial: 7 in the high_fiber diet group and 1 in the AHA diet group (P = 0.066). LIMITATIONS: Generalizability is unknown. Maintenance of weight loss after cessation of group sessions at 12 months was not assessed. Definitive conclusions cannot be made about dietary equivalence because the study was powered for superiority. CONCLUSION: The more complex AHA diet may result in up to 1.7 kg more weight loss; however, a simplified approach to weight reduction emphasizing only increased fiber intake may be a reasonable alternative for persons with difficulty adhering to more complicated diet regimens.

Childhood hypertension can be classified as primary or secondary, depending on the etiology. Primary or essential hypertension still has its pathophysiology not fully elucidated, and there is no consensus in the literature on most underlying mechanisms. In this review, genetic and environmental factors, including sodium and potassium intake, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, family structure, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, prematurity and low birth weight, prenatal and postnatal exposures are highlighted. Objective(s): The present study aimed to perform an update on primary hypertension in childhood, providing clinicians and researchers an overview of the current state of the literature regarding the influence of genetic and environmental factors. Method(s): This integrative review searched for articles on genetic and environmental factors related to primary hypertension in pediatric patients. The databases evaluated were PubMed and Scopus. Result(s): The studies have provided insights regarding many genetic and environmental factors, in addition to their association with the pathophysiology of primary hypertension in childhood. Findings corroborated the idea that primary hypertension is a multifactorial disease. Further studies in the pediatric population are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Conclusion(s): The study of primary hypertension in pediatrics has utmost importance for the adoption of preventive measures and the development of more efficient treatments, therefore reducing childhood morbidity and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases and other health consequences later in life.Copyright © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers."

The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a risk stratification model of composite adverse events related to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery., METHODS: The study population included 36,254 patients from the Bariatric Outcomes Longitudinal Database (BOLD) registry who were 18-70 years old and had RYGB between June 11, 2007, and December 2, 2009. This population was randomly divided into a 50% testing sample and a 50% validation sample. The testing sample was used to identify significant predictors of 90-day composite adverse events and estimate odds ratios, while the validation sample was used to assess model calibration. After validating the fit of the risk stratification model, the testing and validation samples were combined to estimate the final odds ratios., RESULTS: The 90-day composite adverse event rate was 1.48%. The risk stratification model of 90-day composite adverse events included age (40-64, >= 65), indicators for male gender, body mass index (50-59.9, >= 60), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, back pain, diabetes, pulmonary hypertension, ischemic heart disease, functional status, and American Society of Anesthesiology classes 4 or 5. Our final gastric bypass model was predictive (c-statistic = .68) of serious adverse events 90 days after surgery., CONCLUSIONS: With additional validation, this risk model can inform both the patient and surgeon about the risks of bariatric surgery and its different procedures, as well as enable valid outcomes comparisons between surgeons and surgical programs.

Patients suffer from debilitating headaches, pulsatile tinnitus, nausea, vomiting, photophobia and radicular pain. At this rate, treatment cost will increase to 462.7 million pounds sterling annually by 2030. Weight loss is the only proven disease-modifying therapy for reversal of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Bariatric surgery leads to superlative weight loss and reversal of related comorbidities. The case series and literature review aim to raise awareness of bariatric surgery as a safe and effective treatment modality for idiopathic intracranial hypertension., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The literature review comprises three systematic analysis and one randomised control trial which were identified after a PubMed search. In the case series, we have included four patients with a preoperative diagnosis of long-standing idiopathic intracranial hypertension. They were referred to our department for bariatric surgery by the neuro-ophthalmologist between January and December 2018. They were followed up for 2 years after bariatric surgery., RESULTS: All four patients were women with a mean age of 34 years. Mean body mass index reduced from 47.3 kg/m2 before surgery to 30 kg/m2 at the end of 2 years after surgery. They showed significant improvement or resolution in their symptoms related to idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and none of them required further cerebrospinal fluid pressure reducing procedures., CONCLUSION: Bariatric surgery is a safe and effective method of treating idiopathic intracranial hypertension. It is superior compared to medical management and cerebrospinal fluid pressure reducing procedures which have high rates of recurrence. Copyright © 2021.

Sympatholytic drugs might decrease the need for intravenous or inhalation anaesthetics and opioids and also decrease postoperative adverse events. Method: Sixty patients were included. Propofol, fentanyl and rocuronium were used for induction. Study groups were as follows; group E, esmolol infusion was added to sevoflurane and fentanyl, group N only sevoflurane and fentanyl was used during maintenance of anaesthesia. Patients were monitored during the intraoperative period and postoperatively for 24 h for analgesic requirements and PONV. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain was also assessed. Results: Analgesic and anaesthetic requirements were significantly lower in group E than in group N (P_value <0.05). VAS scores were significantly lower in group E than in group N (Pvalue <0.05). PONV incidence was significantly lower in group E than in group N (Pvalue <0.05). Heart rates and blood pressures were significantly lower in group E compared to group N (P_value <0.05) Conclusion: Using esmolol during anaesthetic maintenance of laparoscopic bariatric surgery significantly decreases anaesthetic and analgesic requirements, postoperative pain, PONV and postoperative hypoxia."

Fasting alters the gut microbiome reducing blood pressure and body weight in metabolic syndrome patients	2021	10.1038/s41467-021-22097-0	CN-02266117	"Periods of fasting and refeeding may reduce cardiometabolic risk elevated by Western diet. Here we show in the substudy of NCT02099968, investigating the clinical parameters, the immunome and gut microbiome exploratory endpoints, that in hypertensive metabolic syndrome patients, a 5_day fast followed by a modified Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension diet reduces systolic blood pressure, need for antihypertensive medications, body_mass index at three months post intervention compared to a modified Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension diet alone. Fasting alters the gut microbiome, impacting bacterial taxa and gene modules associated with short_chain fatty acid production. Cross_system analyses reveal a positive correlation of circulating mucosa_associated invariant T cells, non_classical monocytes and CD4+ effector T cells with systolic blood pressure. Furthermore, regulatory T cells positively correlate with body_mass index and weight. Machine learning analysis of baseline immunome or microbiome data predicts sustained systolic blood pressure response within the fasting group, identifying CD8+ effector T cells, Th17 cells and regulatory T cells or Desulfovibrionaceae, Hydrogenoanaerobacterium, Akkermansia, and Ruminococcaceae as important contributors to the model.

Results of a multicenter, randomised controlled study"	2016	10.1159/000446744	CN-01167760	"Background and Aims: The growing prevalence of obesity is followed by increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Currently, the two most common surgical procedures for obesity are Roux_en_Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Few randomized controlled studies have compared these procedures in the treatment of obese patients with T2DM. The aim of the study was to compare diabetes remission rate (HbA1c < 42 mmol/mol, with or without diabetes medications) in obese T2DM patients (BMI 35_50) undergoing RYGB or SG. Material and Methods: Forty_nine patients were included in four bariatric surgery centers in Sweden. Twenty_six were randomized to RYGB and 23 to SG. There were no difference between groups regarding patients characteristics, duration of T2DM, use of antidiabetic medications or glycemic control. Complete one_year follow_up data was available for 16 SG and 19 RYGB patients. Results: At one_year postoperatively, patients in the RYGB group had significantly higher %EWL as compared to SG, 77.1% vs 62.6% (p = 0.04). There was no difference between groups regarding reduced use of medications lowering glucose, lipids and blood pressure. The T2DM remission rate after RYGB was 68% as compared to 50% after SG (p = 0.268). Glycemic control improved significantly in both groups with mean HbA1c of 40.5 ± 6.8 and 42.1 ± 8.6 mmol/mol after RYGB and SG, respectively (p = 0.544). There were no severe complications or deaths. Conclusion: T2DM remission rate did not differ between RYGB and SG despite significantly higher %EWL after RYGB. Long_term follow_up data are needed to define the role of SG in the treatment of patients with obesity and T2DM."

J. Manni	Does obesity management impact significantly on morbidity?	2010	https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-789X.2010.00763-3.x		"Given the unequivocal association between a wide range of morbidity and increasing adiposity, advice to lose weight is the obvious therapeutic measure for those who are overweight or obese. However, several observational studies suggest that intentional weight loss may at least in some circumstances be associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In some settings, the findings are more reassuring than others. Among those at risk of diabetes, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that lifestyle interventions resulting in weight loss can reduce progression of type 2 diabetes over a prolonged period and quasi-experimental studies that in the morbidly obese, bariatric surgery can similarly reduce risk of progression or even normalisation of blood glucose in those with type 2 diabetes. Limited observational data suggest some prolongation of survival time in those with diabetes who have lost weight compared with those who have not. The findings in observational studies that overweight patients with established coronary heart disease, heart failure and hypertension have a better prognosis than those who are not overweight or obese has been a cause of concern. This paradox can be explained by the effects of unintentional weight loss or pre-existing disease but plausible mechanisms have been suggested. The issue can only be fully resolved by RCTs and investigations such as the Swedish obese subjects study which has already demonstrated that those who have had bariatric surgery have improved mortality from myocardial infarction and cancer over a 10-year period compared with matched controls. The totality of evidence currently available continues to justify the recommendation that most overweight and obese patients should be advised to lose weight."

Methods: Prospective randomized controlled trial. Obese patients (body mass index >50 Kg/m 2 ) undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomies were recruited and provided an informed signed consent. Patients were randomized using a computer generated randomization table to receive either opioid or non_opioid based anesthesia. The patient and the investigator scoring patient outcome after surgery were blinded to the anesthetic protocol. Primary outcomes were hemodynamics in the form of ""heart rate, systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure"" on induction and 1/2 hourly thereafter. Pain monitoring through visual analog scale (VAS) 30 min after recovery, hourly for 2 h and every 4 h for 24 h was also recorded. Pain monitoring through VAS and post_operative nausea and vomiting 30 min after recovery were also recorded and finally patient satisfaction and acute pain nurse satisfaction. Results: There was no difference in background characteristics in both groups. There were no statistically significant differences in different outcomes as heart rate, mean blood pressure, O 2 saturation in different timings between groups at any of the determined eight time points but pain score and nurse satisfaction showed a trend to better performance with non_opioid treatment. Conclusion: Nonopioid based general anesthesia for Bariatric surgery is as effective as opioid one. There is no need to use opioids for such surgery especially that there was a trend to less pain in non_opioid anesthesia."

Body composition, cardiometabolic risk factors, physical fitness, basal metabolic rate, and quality of life were assessed at baseline and at the end of the study., RESULTS: After the exercise program, the EG achieved significant reductions in total weight (- 7.3 +/- 4.1 kg, P < 0.01), fat mass (- 7.1 +/- 4.7 kg, P < 0.01), and waist circumference (- 5.3 +/- 2.1 cm, P < 0.01), while they maintained their fat-free mass and basal metabolic rate levels. Only the EG showed reductions in HbA1c (- 0.4 +/- 0.45%, P < 0.05), systolic (- 10.5 +/- 12.7 mmHg), and diastolic blood pressure (- 3.9 +/- 5.2 mmHg, P < 0.05), as well as a decrease in waist-to-height ratio (- 0.032 +/- 0.12, P < 0.01) and an improvement in quality of life., CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of an exercise program prior to bariatric surgery reduces fat mass and central obesity and improves cardiometabolic risk factors and quality of life, especially in the physical scales., TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03613766)."

Bariatric surgery decreases the burden of cardiovascular disease in obese patients through complex mechanisms, of which weight loss is merely the most evident epiphenomenon. The aim of this study is to evaluate C-IMT variations in patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and possible correlations with biometric parameters and cardiovascular risk factors., METHODS: Thirty patients undergoing RYGB for morbid obesity were enrolled for carotid artery B-mode ultrasound evaluation before surgery and at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up; C-IMT was recorded at three levels (bulb, common, and internal carotid). At each one of the follow-ups, biometric and serohematic parameters were also collected., RESULTS: The 22 patients who completed the follow-up and were included in the study showed significant C-IMT reduction at all three levels at 12-month follow-up (p < 0.001). Along with a significant BMI reduction and diabetes/hypertension remission, we found a considerable decrease in total cholesterol (219 vs 164 mg/dl; p < 0.001) and uric acid (5.6 vs 4.5 mg/dl; p < 0.01) and a significant increase in HDL cholesterol (43.9vs59.2 mg/dl; p < 0.001). The data imply that the mean 10-year cardiovascular risk score drops by nearly 50 % (5.7 +/- 5.6 vs. 2.9 +/- 2.7 %, p < 0.001) according to Framingham cardiovascular risk stratification., CONCLUSIONS: RYGB is associated with significant decrease in C-IMT at 1 year. Pathophysiologic processes underlying such a variation, probably involving lipid and urate metabolism and their correlation with cardiovascular risk reduction should be confirmed by long-term prospective trials."

Exercise, Exercise and Group Therapy, or Conventional Waiting: a Randomized Controlled Trial"	2017	https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11695-016-2365-z		"OBJECTIVE: This trial's objective was to investigate the effect of an exercise program with and without cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), compared by a control group, on weight, functional capacity, and cardiometabolic profile of morbidly obese individuals while waiting for bariatric surgery., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized controlled trial investigated the effect of a 4-month low-intensity exercise program (two weekly sessions of 25 min each) on 66 morbidly obese individuals awaiting bariatric surgery. Participants were randomly divided into three groups: EXER, exercise program; EXER + CBT, exercise program plus support group sessions for lifestyle modification, with a CBT; and CONTROL, routine treatment. They were compared on weight, functional capacity, and cardiometabolic profile., RESULTS: The weight change (Kg) was -7.4 (-9.6 to 5,1); -4,2 (-6,8 to -1.6) and 2.9 (0.4 to 5.3) and the BMI change (kg/m2) was -2.7 (-3.6 to -1.8); -1.4 (-2.4 to -0.4) and 1.1 (0.1 to 2.1) for groups EXER, EXER + CBT, and CONTROL, respectively. Changes were significant when compared to the control group (p < 0.001), but there were no differences between the two intervention arms (p = 0.2). Functional capacity and cardiometabolic parameters significantly improved in the intervention arms and worsened in the control group. The adherence to the exercise program in both groups was above 78 %., CONCLUSION: A 4-month, twice-weekly supervised program of low-intensity physical activity that encourages individuals to adopt a more active lifestyle can positively interfere with weight loss and improvement in functional capacity and cardiometabolic parameters of morbidly obese individuals with and without the aid of support group sessions."

Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) is a novel, minimally invasive endoscopic procedure thought to mimic some of the effects of a more common surgery, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Patient factors affecting procedural choice are unexplored., OBJECTIVE: This formative study aimed to determine the preoperative and early postoperative characteristics of adults matched for age, sex, and BMI who chose ESG versus LSG., METHODS: This prospective cohort study recruited ESG and matched LSG adults in Australia. Preoperative outcomes were medical history, glycemic biomarkers, blood lipids, liver function enzymes, albumin, blood pressure, hepatic steatosis index, the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale, the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite questionnaire, and body composition via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Adverse events were recorded preoperatively and up to 2 weeks postoperatively. SPSS was used to test if there were differences between cohorts by comparing means or mean ranks, and binary regression was used to understand how characteristics might predict procedure choice., RESULTS: A total of 50 (including 25 ESG and 25 LSG) patients were recruited, who were primarily White (45/50, 90%) and female (41/50, 82%) with a mean age of 41.7 (SD 9.4) years. Participants had a mean of 4.0 (SD 2.2) active comorbid conditions, with the most common being nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (38/50, 76%), back pain (32/50, 64%), anxiety or depression (24/50, 48%), and joint pain (23/50, 46%). The LSG cohort had higher hemoglobin A1c (5.3%, SD 0.2%) than the ESG cohort (5%, SD 0.2%; P=.008). There was a 2.4 kg/m2 difference in median BMI (P=.03) between the groups, but fat and fat-free mass had no meaningful differences. Comparing the LSG and ESG groups showed that the LSG group had lower total quality of life (49.5%, SD 10.6% vs 56.6%, SD 12.7%; P=.045), lower weight-related self-esteem (10.7%, IQR 3.6%-25% vs 25%, IQR 17.9%-39.3%; P=.02), and worse abdominal pain (38.9%, IQR 33.3%-50% vs 53.9%, SD 14.2%, P=.01). For every percent improvement in weight-related self-esteem, the odds for selecting ESG increased by 4.4% (95% CI 1.004-1.085; P=.03). For every percent worsening in hunger pain, the odds for selecting ESG decreased by 3.3% (95% CI 0.944-0.990; P=.004)., CONCLUSIONS: There was very little evidence that Australian adults who chose an endoscopic versus surgical sleeve had different rates of comorbidities, body fat percentage, or weight-related quality of life. There was evidence against the test hypothesis, that is, there was evidence suggesting that lower self-esteem predicted choosing a more invasive sleeve (ie, LSG rather than ESG)., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12618000337279; https://anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=374595.

A systematic review and meta-analysis"	2020	https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/obr.13012		"This systematic review and meta-analysis of intervention studies aims to evaluate the effect of preoperative and/or post-operative support for adults who elect bariatric surgery delivered by a multidisciplinary team (MDT) on post-operative body composition, mental health, co-morbidities, quality of life, and side effects. Six electronic databases were searched. Revman and GRADE were used to assess confidence in pooled effects. Included interventions (N = 1533 participants in total) focused on lifestyle counselling (n = 4 studies), psychology (n = 4 studies), or exercise (n = 10 studies); comparator groups were less intensive usual care. Intensive MDT interventions increased post-operative weight loss (SMD: -0.94; 95% CI: -1.27 to -0.61) if delivered post-operatively. Preoperative and post-operative intensive interventions improved symptoms of depression and anxiety, quality of life, diastolic blood pressure, and resting heart rate but not lipids or glycaemic measures. Whilst usual MDT care is important preoperatively, this review conditionally recommends intensive MDT interventions for enhanced post-operative weight loss if delivered in the post-operative period, led by any health professional, based on moderate evidence.

Bariatric surgery is associated with improved long-term cardiovascular and renal outcomes., AREAS COVERED: All major case-control, cohort, and randomized controlled trial studies of bariatric surgery in adults with T2DM were screened and data on prespecified cardiovascular and renal outcomes collated. Bariatric surgery reduces all-cause mortality and risk of cardiovascular disease, albuminuria and progressive chronic kidney disease. Patients with poorer glycemic control and established microvascular disease preoperatively may stand to benefit the most from the surgical approach. Reduced sympathetic drive, remission of glomerular hypertension, enhanced natriuresis, gut microbiota shifts, reduced systemic and renal inflammation, improved lipoprotein profiles, and reductions in chronic cardiac remodeling may all be implicated., EXPERT COMMENTARY: Ongoing RCTs of bariatric surgery selectively recruiting patients with class 1 obesity and established microvascular complications of diabetes will help to better characterize which subgroups of patients benefit most from this effective therapy."

Urinary Metabolomic Changes Accompanying Albuminuria Remission following Gastric Bypass Surgery for Type 2 Diabetic Kidney Disease	2022	10.3390/metabo12020139	CN-02385239	"In the Microvascular Outcomes after Metabolic Surgery randomised clinical trial (MOMS RCT, NCT01821508), combined metabolic surgery (gastric bypass) plus medical therapy (CSM) was superior to medical therapy alone (MTA) as a means of achieving albuminuria remission at 2_year follow_up in patients with obesity and early diabetic kidney disease (DKD). In the present study, we assessed the urinary1H_NMR metabolome in a subgroup of patients from both arms of the MOMS RCT at baseline and 6_month follow_up. Whilst CSM and MTA both reduced the urinary excretion of sugars, CSM generated a distinctive urinary metabolomic profile characterised by increases in hostÐmicrobial co_metabolites (N_phenylacetylglycine, trimethylamine N_oxide, and 4_ aminobutyrate (GABA)) and amino acids (arginine and glutamine). Furthermore, reductions in aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine and tyrosine), as well as branched_chain amino acids (BCAAs) and related catabolites (valine, leucine, 3_hydroxyisobutyrate, 3_hydroxyisovalerate, and 3_methyl_ 2_oxovalerate), were observed following CSM but not MTA. Improvements in BMI did not correlate with improvements in metabolic and renal indices following CSM. Conversely, urinary metabolites changed by CSM at 6 months were moderately to strongly correlated with improvements in blood pressure, glycaemia, triglycerides, and albuminuria up to 24 months following treatment initiation, highlighting the potential involvement of these shifts in the urinary metabolomic profile in the metabolic and renoprotective effects of CSM."

The molecular mechanisms involved in the metabolic improvement after BS are not completely resolved. Epigenetic modifications could have an important role. Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different BS procedures (Roux_en_Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy) on global DNA methylation (long interspersed nucleotide element 1 [LINE_1]) in a group of nondiabetic and diabetic severely obese patients. Setting University hospital, Spain. Methods This study included 60 patients (30 nondiabetic and 30 diabetic severely obese patients) undergoing BS: 31 patients underwent Roux_en_Y gastric bypass and 29 underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Before and 6 months post_BS, anthropometric data, blood pressure, and metabolic parameters were determined. LINE_1 DNA methylation was quantified by pyrosequencing. We used the methylation levels of tumor necrosis factor_alpha as a control gene promoter. Results There were no differences between LINE_1 methylation levels at baseline and at 6 months after surgery (66.3+/_1.6 versus 66.2+/_2.06). Likewise, there was no statistically significant difference on LINE_1 methylation levels when we stratified according to metabolic status (diabetic versus nondiabetic), nor was there regarding the BS procedure. A strong correlation was shown between LINE_1 methylation levels and weight at baseline both in diabetic and nondiabetic obese patients (r = .486; P<.001). Tumor necrosis factor_alpha methylation levels increased significantly after BS in the group of diabetic obese patients. Conclusion After BS, global LINE_1 methylation is not modified in the short term. More studies are required to determine if LINE_1 is a stable epigenetic marker, or, on the contrary, if it is susceptible to modification by external factors such as changes in lifestyle or a surgical intervention.

K. Masuo	Treatments for obesity-related hypertension	2011	http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/1573402111107030184		"Obesity, hypertension and obesity-related hypertension are growing health problems. Several epidemiological studies have shown a high prevalence of cardiovascular complications and all cause of mortality in obesity and hypertension. Obesity and hypertension are important and independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease development. An integrated cardiovascular risk management approach involving aggressive blood pressure (BP) control should be adopted in patients at high cardiovascular risk (i.e. those with ischemic heart disease, end-organ damage, type 2 diabetes) and the use of well-tolerated antihypertensive agents with protective benefits beyond BP lowering. The identification and management of risk factors is an important part of the overall management of hypertensive patients. Given that obese patients are more predisposed to target organ damage development, stringent targets for blood pressure control have been set in clinical guidelines, including those of the Joint National Committee (JNC-7) [1], the World Health Organisation and the International Society of Hypertension (WHO/ISH) [2], the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) [3] and the Japanese Society of Hypertension (JSH-2009) [4]. Pertinently, clinical trials and real-life evidence suggest that these targets are difficult to achieve. Hypertension in obesity is characterized by stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), elevated sympathetic activity, insulin resistance and selective leptin resistance. Importantly, these characteristics, even in isolation constitute risk factors for cardiovascular disease development and progression. It is therefore imperative that pharmacological treatments should be selected based on favourable effects on these factors. Furthermore, in choosing an antihypertensive agent, effectiveness needs to be accompanied by favourable metabolic, cardioprotective, and renal protective properties. Recent pharmacogenetic studies have shown that several polymorphisms may contribute to antihypertensive effectiveness. Weight loss is recommended as the first line of treatment for hypertension associated with obesity. Indeed, lifestyle modification including a low caloric diet, reducing sedentary behaviour and exercise form the foundation of all therapy. For the subjects who are more severe obesity or inability to undertake an exercise program, bariatric surgery are recommended. Anti-obesity drugs have been developed but unfortunately some were associated with significant side effects and were recently withdrawn from the markets in the United States, Europe and Australia. Leptin administration has a theoretical basis in obesity therapy and, while it has been examined in overweight and obese human subjects and in animal models, the anti-obesity effects of leptin administration are controversial. The combination of high blood pressure with obesity, for a variety of reasons, renders the hypertension difficult to control, with patients frequently requiring two or more types of medications to achieve blood pressure goals. Many large cohort studies have compared the efficacies of antihypertensive drug classes in hypertensive patients with the metabolic syndrome, however, there are few systemic reviews of antihypertensive drug treatments for patients with obesity. Moreover the mechanisms underlying both obesity and hypertension remain to be elucidated therby making it difficult to achieve blood pressure goals. In this review I aim to provide a synthesis of the current data examining both pharmacological and nonpharmacological antihypertensive treatments in those patients with obesity-related hypertension. © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers."
L. Mattar and N. Zeeni	"Effect of movie violence on mood, stress, appetite perception and food preference: a randomized controlled trial"	2015		CN-01160597	"Background: TV/movie watching has been associated with increased risk for obesity. Weight gain is promoted due to both the sedentary behavior aspect of watching TV/movies and the increase in energy intake while doing the activity (snacking, eating alone, impulsive eating). Violence has become a major component of media content and it results in an increase in heart rate, blood pressure, and a general effect on cardiovascular health. Yet, few studies have investigated media violence and its effect on appetite, eating behavior and food preferences specifically. Two studies conducted on playing violent video games, which is a participatory game, indicated that such violence exposure was associated with elevated markers of stress and appetite, and an increased consumption of food during a test meal. he present study aimed at investigating the immediate acute effect of violence in movies, on appetite and stress hormones, heart rate and blood pressure, along with food preferences and intakes in young normal weight individuals. Methods: Eligible participants (n=45) age between 18_40, normal BMI, are randomized to either control group (watching a non_violent narrative movie) or the experimental group (watching a violent movie). Subjects are required to fast and to avoid drinking caffeinated beverages for 12 hours prior to their visit in which assessments and movie watching occurs. Upon arrival, height, weight, and waist circumference are measured. Baseline measurements are taken after subjects consume a standardized breakfast which include Heart Rate (HR), Blood Pressure (BP), Grip Strength, and appetite and stress perception using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Saliva sample collection is performed too for the alpha_amylase analysis. Similar measurements are performed after movie viewing. Subjects are then provided with a snack tray after the movie containing various items (salty, sweet, fatty, healthy, etc) to be consumed ad libitum whereby ingested quantities are calculated afterwards. Study is performed at the Lebanese American University. Preliminary Results: 22 participants have so far completed the trial, data collection will be done by June 1st. Preliminary results showed that passive exposure to movie violence lead to an elevated HR (p=0.04), Grip Strength (p=0.032) (indicator of stress and glucose release in the muscle) and stress (measured by the VAS) in the experimental group compared to the control. No changes has been noted in blood pressure. An increase in appetite and a preference for fatty foods was observed. Results of the salivary amylase will help us understand the relation between changes in eating behavior in relation to stress. Conclusion: This very novel trial will help us in understanding the effect of violence in movies (and other medium) on food preferences, appetite and eating behavior. Violence has become a major component in media and might be affecting weight balance in high consummers. The study is a replica of real life environement/experience and could hold promising results."

We investigated the short_term effects of MAP of 65 or 85 mmHg on splanchnic oxygen flux, metabolic function, mucosal perfusion and cytokine regulation. Methods A single_center, randomized controlled, double cross_over trial was performed. Patients were randomized to: HLH (high_low_ high) where MAP targets were 85_65_85 mmHg in sequence, with each lasting 2 hours, or LHL (low_high_low) where MAP targets were 65_ 85_65 mmHg. Blood pressure was adjusted with noradrenalin infusion. Results Six + six patients were included in the study. MAP targets were achieved in all patients at all time points (64 +/_ 3, 84 +/_ 4; 65 +/_ 5 mmHg in the LHL group and 84 +/_ 3; 66 +/_ 2; 85 +/_ 5 mmHg in the HLH group at the first, second and third time points), with corresponding changes in filling pressures. Cardiac output did not change over time. Hepatic venous saturation was 41 +/_ 15; 58 +/_ 24; 56 +/_ 21% in the LHL group and 50 +/_ 19; 43 +/_ 20; 41 +/_ 18% in the HLH group at the first, second and third time points, with a significant time group interaction (P <0.05). No changes were observed in global or trans_splanchnic lactate levels and cytokine levels or in gastric tonometry CO2. Conclusion Increasing MAP with norepinephrine has some effects splanchnic oxygenation, but has no impact on metabolic or biochemical function and key cytokine removal or release. MAP targets of 60 to 65 mmHg or 80 to 85 mmHg appear physiologically equivalent for the splanchnic circulation."

This review examines evidence for screening and treating obesity in adults. Data Sources: MEDLINE and Cochrane Library (January 1994 through February 2003). Study Selection: Systematic reviews; randomized, controlled trials; and observational studies of obesity's health outcomes or efficacy of obesity treatment. Data Extraction: Two reviewers independently abstracted data on study design, sample, sample size, treatment, outcomes, and quality. Data Synthesis: No trials evaluated mass screening for obesity, so the authors evaluated indirect evidence for efficacy. Pharmacotherapy or counseling interventions produced modest (generally 3 to 5 kg) weight loss over at least 6 or 12 months, respectively. Counseling was most effective when intensive and combined with behavioral therapy. Maintenance strategies helped retain weight loss. Selected surgical patients lost substantial weight (10 to 159 kg over 1 to 5 years). Weight reduction improved blood pressure, lipid levels, and glucose metabolism and decreased diabetes incidence. The internal validity of the treatment trials was fair to good, and external validity was limited by the minimal ethnic or gender diversity of volunteer participants. No data evaluated counseling harms. Primary adverse drug effects included hypertension with sibutramine (mean increase, 0 mm Hg to 3.5 mm Hg) and gastrointestinal distress with orlistat (1% to 37% of patients). Fewer than 1% (pooled samples) of surgical patients died; up to 25% needed surgery again over 5 years. Conclusion(s): Counseling and pharmacotherapy can promote modest sustained weight loss, improving clinical outcomes. Pharmacotherapy appears safe in the short term; long-term safety has not been as strongly established. In selected patients, surgery promotes large amounts of weight loss with rare but sometimes severe complications."
"K. M. McTigue, R. Hess and J. Ziouras"	Obesity in older adults: a systematic review of the evidence for diagnosis and treatment	2006			"OBJECTIVE: Although obesity is increasing in older U.S. adults, treatment is controversial in this age group. We sought to examine evidence concerning obesity's health-related risks, diagnostic methods, and treatment outcomes in older individuals., RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: We searched MEDLINE and Cochrane Library databases, consulted with experts, and examined bibliographies for English language studies discussing obesity in older adults (mean age > or = 60), published between January 1980 and November 2005. Inclusion criteria were met by 32 longitudinal analyses, seven diagnostic studies, and 17 randomized controlled trial articles. At least two authors independently reviewed and abstracted study design, population, results, and quality information., RESULTS: Correlations between body fat and three anthropometric measures (BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio) decrease with age but remain clinically significant. Obesity contributes to risk for several cardiovascular endpoints, some cancers, and impaired mobility but protects against hip fracture. The association between obesity and mortality declines as age increases. Intensive counseling strategies incorporating behavioral, dietary, and exercise components promote a weight loss of 3 to 4 kg over 1 to 3.3 years. The loss is linked with improved glucose tolerance, improved physical functioning, reduced incidence of diabetes and a combined hypertension and cardiovascular endpoint, and reduced bone density., DISCUSSION: In older adults, obesity can be diagnosed with standard clinical measures. Intensive counseling can promote modest sustained weight loss, but data are insufficient to evaluate surgical or pharmacological options. Obesity treatment is most likely to benefit individuals with high cardiovascular risk. Limited data suggest possible functional improvement. Treatment should incorporate measures to avoid bone loss."

Methods: Each recommendation was evaluated and updated based on new evidence from 2013 to the present and subjective factors provided by experts. Results: New or updated topics in this CPG include: contextualization in an adiposity-based chronic disease complications-centric model, nuance-based and algorithm/checklist-assisted clinical decision-making about procedure selection, novel bariatric procedures, enhanced recovery after bariatric surgery protocols, and logistical concerns (including cost factors) in the current health-care arena. There are 85 numbered recommendations that have updated supporting evidence, of which 61 are revised and 12 are new. Noting that there can be multiple recommendation statements within a single numbered recommendation, there are 31 (13%) Grade A, 42 (17%) Grade B, 72 (29%) Grade C, and 101 (41%) Grade D recommendations. There are 858 citations, of which 81 (9.4%) are evidence level (EL) 1 (highest), 562 (65.5%) are EL 2, 72 (8.4%) are EL 3, and 143 (16.7%) are EL 4 (lowest). Conclusion: Bariatric procedures remain a safe and effective intervention for higher-risk patients with obesity.

S. Medical Advisory	Bariatric surgery: an evidence-based analysis	2005			"OBJECTIVE: To conduct an evidence-based analysis of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery., BACKGROUND: Obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of at last 30 kg/m(2). () Morbid obesity is defined as a BMI of at least 40 kg/m(2) or at least 35 kg/m(2) with comorbid conditions. Comorbid conditions associated with obesity include diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemias, obstructive sleep apnea, weight-related arthropathies, and stress urinary incontinence. It is also associated with depression, and cancers of the breast, uterus, prostate, and colon, and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Obesity is also associated with higher all-cause mortality at any age, even after adjusting for potential confounding factors like smoking. A person with a BMI of 30 kg/m(2) has about a 50% higher risk of dying than does someone with a healthy BMI. The risk more than doubles at a BMI of 35 kg/m(2). An expert estimated that about 160,000 people are morbidly obese in Ontario. In the United States, the prevalence of morbid obesity is 4.7% (1999-2000). In Ontario, the 2004 Chief Medical Officer of Health Report said that in 2003, almost one-half of Ontario adults were overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m(2)) or obese (BMI >= 30 kg/m(2)). About 57% of Ontario men and 42% of Ontario women were overweight or obese. The proportion of the population that was overweight or obese increased gradually from 44% in 1990 to 49% in 2000, and it appears to have stabilized at 49% in 2003. The report also noted that the tendency to be overweight and obese increases with age up to 64 years. BMI should be used cautiously for people aged 65 years and older, because the ""normal"" range may begin at slightly above 18.5 kg/m(2) and extend into the ""overweight"" range. The Chief Medical Officer of Health cautioned that these data may underestimate the true extent of the problem, because they were based on self reports, and people tend to over-report their height and under-report their weight. The actual number of Ontario adults who are overweight or obese may be higher. Diet, exercise, and behavioural therapy are used to help people lose weight. The goals of behavioural therapy are to identify, monitor, and alter behaviour that does not help weight loss. Techniques include self-monitoring of eating habits and physical activity, stress management, stimulus control, problem solving, cognitive restructuring, contingency management, and identifying and using social support. Relapse, when people resume old, unhealthy behaviour and then regain the weight, can be problematic. Drugs (including gastrointestinal lipase inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and appetite suppressants) may be used if behavioural interventions fail. However, estimates of efficacy may be confounded by high rates of noncompliance, in part owing to the side effects of the drugs. In addition, the drugs have not been approved for indefinite use, despite the chronic nature of obesity., THE TECHNOLOGY: Morbidly obese people may be eligible for bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgery for morbid obesity is considered an intervention of last resort for patients who have attempted first-line forms of medical management, such as diet, increased physical activity, behavioural modification, and drugs. There are various bariatric surgical procedures and several different variations for each of these procedures. The surgical interventions can be divided into 2 general types: malabsorptive (bypassing parts of the gastrointestinal tract to limit the absorption of food), and restrictive (decreasing the size of the stomach so that the patient is satiated with less food). All of these may be performed as either open surgery or laparoscopically. An example of a malabsorptive technique is Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Examples of restrictive techniques are vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) and adjustable gastric banding (AGB). The Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) Schedule of Benefits for Physician Services includes fee code ""S120 gastric bypass or p rtition, for morbid obesity"" as an insured service. The term gastric bypass is a general term that encompasses a variety of surgical methods, all of which involve reconfiguring the digestive system. The term gastric bypass does not include AGB. The number of gastric bypass procedures funded and done in Ontario, and funded as actual out-of-country approvals,() is shown below. Number of Gastric Bypass Procedures by Fiscal Year: Ontario and Actual Out-of-Country (OOC) ApprovalsData from Provider Services, MOHLTCCourtesy of Provider Services, Ministry of Health and Long Term Care, REVIEW STRATEGY: The Medical Advisory Secretariat reviewed the literature to assess the effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery to treat morbid obesity. It used its standard search strategy to retrieve international health technology assessments and English-language journal articles from selected databases. The interventions of interest were bariatric surgery and, for the controls, either optimal conventional management or another type of bariatric procedure. The outcomes of interest were improvement in comorbid conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension); short- and long-term weight loss; quality of life; adverse effects; and economic analysis data. The databases yielded 15 international health technology assessments or systematic reviews on bariatric surgery. Subsequently, the Medical Advisory Secretariat searched MEDLINE and EMBASE from April 2004 to December 2004, after the search cut-off date of April, 2004, for the most recent systematic reviews on bariatric surgery. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria. One of those 10 was the Swedish Obese Subjects study, which started as a registry and intervention study, and then published findings on people who had been enrolled for at least 2 years or at least 10 years. In addition to the literature review of economic analysis data, the Medical Advisory Secretariat also did an Ontario-based economic analysis., SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: Bariatric surgery generally is effective for sustained weight loss of about 16% for people with BMIs of at least 40 kg/m(2) or at least 35 kg/m(2) with comorbid conditions (including diabetes, high lipid levels, and hypertension). It also is effective at resolving the associated comorbid conditions. This conclusion is largely based on level 3a evidence from the prospectively designed Swedish Obese Subjects study, which recently published 10-year outcomes for patients who had bariatric surgery compared with patients who received nonsurgical treatment. (1)Regarding specific procedures, there is evidence that malabsorptive techniques are better than other banding techniques for weight loss and resolution of comorbid illnesses. However, there are no published prospective, long-term, direct comparisons of these techniques available.Surgery for morbid obesity is considered an intervention of last resort for patients who have attempted first-line forms of medical management, such as diet, increased physical activity, behavioural modification, and drugs. In the absence of direct comparisons of active nonsurgical intervention via caloric restriction with bariatric techniques, the following observations are made:A recent systematic review examining the efficacy of major commercial and organized self-help weight loss programs in the United States concluded that the evidence to support the use of such programs was suboptimal, except for one trial on Weight Watchers. Furthermore, the programs were associated with high costs, attrition rates, and probability of regaining at least 50% of the lost weight in 1 to 2 years. (2)A recent randomized controlled trial reported 1-year outcomes comparing weight loss and metabolic changes in severely obese patients assigned to either a low-carbohydrate diet or a conventional weight loss diet. At 1 year, weight loss was similar for patients in each group (mean, 2-5 kg). There was a favourable effect on triglyceride levels and glycemic control in the low-carbohydrate diet group. (3)A decision-analysis model showed bariatric surg ry results in increased life expectancy in morbidly obese patients when compared to diet and exercise. (4)A cost-effectiveness model showed bariatric surgery is cost-effective relative to nonsurgical management. (5)Extrapolating from 2003 data from the United States, Ontario would likely need to do 3,500 bariatric surgeries per year. It currently does 508 per year, including out-of-country surgeries."
L. F. Meneghini	Impact of bariatric surgery on type 2 diabetes	2007			"The management and prevention of diabetes through lifestyle modifications and weight loss should be the mainstay of therapy in appropriate candidates. Although the results from the Diabetes Prevention Trial and the Finnish Prevention Study support this approach, over 95% of patients not participating in a prevention research study are unable to achieve and maintain any significant weight loss over time. Bariatric surgery for weight loss is an emerging option for more sustainable weight loss in the severely obese subject, especially when obesity is complicated by diabetes or other co-morbidities. The two most common types of procedures currently used in the United States are adjustable gastric bands and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. These procedures can be performed laparoscopically, further reducing the perioperative morbidity and mortality associated with the surgery. While the gastric bypass procedure usually results is greater sustained weight loss (40-50%) than adjustable gastric banding (20-30%), it also carries greater morbidity and nutritional/metabolic issues, such as deficiencies in iron, B12, calcium, and vitamin D. Following bariatric surgery most subjects experience improvements in diabetes control, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and other obesity-related conditions. In patients with impaired glucose tolerance most studies report 99-100% prevention of progression to diabetes, while in subjects with diabetes prior to surgery, resolution of the disease is reported in 64-93% of the cases. While improvements in insulin resistance and beta-cell function are related to surgically induced weight loss, the rapid post-operative improvement in glycemia is possibly due to a combination of decreased nutrient intake and changes in gut hormones as a result of the bypassed intestine. Post-prandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia associated with nesidioblastosis has been described in a series of patients following gastric bypass surgery, and may be related to the described changes in GLP-1 and other gut hormones."

Aim of the present systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies. Method(s): Studies were grouped into 15 different strategies: 1: diet plus physical activity; 2: physical activity; 3-6: anti-diabetic drugs [glitazones, metformin, beta-cell stimulating drugs (sulphanylureas, glinides), alfa-glucosidase inhibitors]; 7-8: cardiovascular drugs (ACE inhibitors, ARB, calcium antagonists); 9-14 [diets, lipid-affecting drugs (orlistat, bezafibrate), vitamins, micronutrients, estrogens, alcohol, coffee]; 15: bariatric surgery. Only controlled studies were included in the analysis, whether randomized, non-randomized, observational studies, whether primarily designed to assess incident cases of diabetes, or performed with other purposes, such as control of hypertension, of ischemic heart disease or prevention of cardiovascular events. Appropriate methodology [preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement] was used. Seventy-one studies (490813 subjects), published as full papers, were analysed to identify predictors of new cases of T2DM, and were included in a meta-analysis (random-effects model) to study the effect of different strategies. Intervention effect (new cases of diabetes) was expressed as odds ratio (OR), with 95% confidence intervals (C.I.s). Publication bias was formally assessed. Result(s): Body mass index was in the overweight range for 13 groups, obese or morbidly obese in lipid-affecting drugs and in bariatric surgery. Non-surgical strategies, except for beta-cell stimulating drugs, estrogens and vitamins, were able to prevent T2DM, with different effectiveness, from 0.37 (C.I. 0.26-0.52) to 0.85 (C.I. 0.77-0.93); the most effective strategy was bariatric surgery in morbidly obese subjects [0.16 (C.I. 0.11,0.24)]. At meta-regression analysis, age of subjects and amount of weight lost were associated with effectiveness of intervention. Conclusion(s): These data indicate that several strategies prevent T2DM, making it possible to make a choice for the individual subject. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
A. Merrill and S. Jones	Effectiveness of surgical weight loss on the remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review	2011			"BACKGROUND: Purpose ful weight loss resulting in loss of excess body fat contributes to enhanced health outcomes such as lower blood pressure, lower cholesterol, reduced blood glucose levels, and reduced mortality. REVIEW OBJECTIVE: To synthesize the best available evidence regarding the effectiveness of surgical weight loss procedures on the remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients 18 years of age and older, females and males with a prior diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus who have undergone a bariatric or surgical weight loss procedure. This review considered surgical weight loss procedures. This review considered as outcome measures: weight loss, body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin A1C values, fasting blood glucose levels, and/or reduction/elimination of antidiabetic medications. This review included randomized controlled trials SEARCH STRATEGY: The search strategy aimed to find both published and unpublished studies in English language only from April 2006 through May 2011. The search used multiple databases including MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, EBSCO, ProQuest, and Science Direct. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: The studies were critically appraised using the standardized instruments provided by the Joanna Briggs Institute. DATA COLLECTION: Data was extracted using standardised data extraction form provided by the Joanna Briggs Institute. DATA SYNTHESIS: Due to the heterogeneous nature of the study methods meta-analysis was considered not appropriate. The results are presented in a narrative summary. RESULTS: Five studies compared varying operative techniques, and results substantiate improvement in dynamics directly linked to T2DM: weight loss, BMI, HbA1c values, and utilization of medications for control. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this review surgical weight loss should be considered a best practice recommendation to patients for the treatment and remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as evidenced by short term effects on weight reduction, change in hemoglobin A1c values, and decrease or elimination of medications to control diabetes IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Patients with T2DM should receive counseling from their practitioner to include surgical weight loss as a means to control the untoward effects of this disease with proven short term results when other weight loss attempts fail. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Further studies are warranted to compare the various procedures (LAGB, LRYBG, and LSG) to one another and to conventional therapy with a larger subset of T2DM participants. It would also be important to follow these patients long term in order to adequately assess efficacy on a continuum. Furthermore, researchers need to establish set methods for outcome definition and measurement in order to allow for meta-analysis and better translation into practice."

We hypothesized that the hypoxia of OSA increases hepatic production of lysyl oxidase (LOX), an enzyme that cross-links collagen, and that LOX may serve as a biomarker of hepatic fibrosis. Design(s): Thirty-five patients with severe obesity underwent liver biopsy, polysomnography, and serum LOX testing. A separate group with severe OSA had serum LOX measured before and after 3 mo of CPAP or no therapy, as did age-matched controls. LOX expression and secretion were measured in mouse hepatocytes following exposure to hypoxia. Setting(s): The Johns Hopkins Bayview Sleep Disorders Center, and the Hypertension Unit of the Heart Institute at the University of Sao Paulo Medical School. Measurements and Results: In the bariatric cohort, the apnea-hypopnea index was higher in patients with hepatic fibrosis than in those without fibrosis (42.7 +/- 30.2 events/h, versus 16.2 +/- 15.5 events/h; P=0.002), as was serum LOX (84.64 +/- 29.71 ng/mL, versus 45.46 +/- 17.16 ng/mL; P < 0.001). In the sleep clinic sample, patients with severe OSA had higher baseline LOX than healthy controls (70.75 ng/mL versus 52.36 ng/mL, P=0.046), and serum LOX decreased in patients with OSA on CPAP (mean decrease 20.49 ng/mL) but not in untreated patients (mean decrease 0.19 ng/mL). Hypoxic mouse hepatocytes demonstrated 5.9-fold increased LOX transcription (P=0.046), and enhanced LOX protein secretion. Conclusion(s): The hypoxic stress of obstructive sleep apnea may increase circulating lysyl oxidase (LOX) levels. LOX may serve as a biomarker of liver fibrosis in patients with severe obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease."

Van Gaal"	Can Bariatric Surgery be Considered Standard Therapy to Treat Type 2 Diabetes?	2013	https://dx.doi.org/10.17925/EE.2013.09.02.86		"With the rapid increase in obesity there has been a pronounced increase in obesity-related metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dyslipidaemia and hypertension. Bariatric surgery is a highly effective treatment for achieving long-term weight loss and is increasingly recognised to have benefits in diabetes treatment and cause improvement in other metabolic factors. Recent small randomised trials reported better glycaemic control after surgical intervention compared to pharmacological therapy. Physiological studies suggest a surgery-specific, weight-independent effect on glucose homeostasis. Long-term efficacy is to be proven. Consensus on definition of diabetes and diabetes remission must be achieved. Larger multicentre, randomised trials need to be done to clarify the place of metabolic surgery in diabetes treatment algorithms."

Design and Methods In this prospective, multicenter, interventional cohort study, subjects with a BMI between 30 and 39.9 who had failed prior weight loss attempts were recruited from 7 surgical centers. The primary effectiveness endpoint required that >40% of subjects achieve >30% excess weight loss (EWL) at 1 year. Secondary endpoints included assessment of comorbidities and quality_of_life. Results Of 149 subjects, 90.6% were female, with mean BMI of 35.3kg/m2. At 1 year, 84.6% of subjects achieved >30% EWL (P < 0.0001), with 65.0% mean EWL; 66.4% of subjects were no longer obese (BMI < 30). Baseline comorbidities improved at 1 year for 64.4% with dyslipidemia, 59.6% with hypertension, and 85.7% with diabetes. Quality_of_life (IWQOL_Lite) also improved (P < 0.0001). The Year 1 results were maintained or improved at 2 years. Regression analysis indicates that each additional 10% weight loss at Year 2 was associated with an increase in IWQOL_Lite by 7.1 points and a decrease in triglycerides by 13.7 mg/dL, fasting glucose by 3.5 mg/dL, and systolic blood pressure by 3.3 mmHg. Most adverse events were mild to moderate and resolved without sequelae within 1 month. Five subjects (3.4%) had explantations.

Orlic"	Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: Emerging targeted therapies to optimize treatment options	2015	https://dx.doi.org/10.2147/DDDT.S64877		"Diet and lifestyle changes have led to worldwide increases in the prevalences of obesity and metabolic syndrome, resulting in substantially greater incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is considered a hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome and is related to diabetes, insulin resistance, central obesity, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an entity that describes liver inflammation due to NAFLD. Growing evidence suggests that NAFLD is a multisystem disease with a clinical burden that is not only confined to liver-related morbidity and mortality, but that also affects several extra-hepatic organs and regulatory pathways. Thus, NAFLD is considered an important public health issue, but there is currently no effective therapy for all NAFLD patients in the general population. Studies seeking optimal therapy for NAFLD and NASH have not yet led to development of a universal protocol for treating this growing problem. Several pharmacological agents have been studied in an effort to improve insulin resistance and the proinflammatory mediators that may be responsible for NASH progression. Cardiovascular risk factors are highly prevalent among NASH patients, and the backbone of treatment regimens for these patients still comprises general lifestyle interventions, including dietary changes and increased physical activity. Vitamin E and thiazolidinedione derivatives are currently the most evidence-based therapeutic options, but only limited clinical evidence is available regarding their long-term efficacy and safety. Vitamin D and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers are promising drugs that are currently being intensively investigated for use in NAFLD/NASH patients.Copyright © 2015 Milic et al."

Our aim was to describe the long-term outcomes of bariatric surgery in a cohort of patients with liver cirrhosis submitted to bariatric surgery., METHODS: This was a multicenter, retrospective observational study performed by the Obesity Group of the Spanish Society of Endocrinology and Nutrition (GOSEEN), with a review of patients with cirrhosis who had undergone bariatric surgery during the period from April 2004 to March 2017 in ten public reference hospitals in Spain., RESULTS: Data on 41 patients with cirrhosis submitted to obesity surgery were collected (mean age 53.8 +/- 7.9 years, 46.3% women, presurgical BMI 45 +/- 8.3 kg/m2). All but one patient belonged to Child-Pugh class A, and sleeve gastrectomy was conducted in 68.3% of cases. Percentage of total weight loss (%TWL) was 26.33 +/- 8.3% and 21.16 +/- 15.32% at 1 and 5 years after surgery, respectively. This was accompanied by a significant reduction of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and dyslipidemia and by an improvement of liver enzymes over time.

Objective(s): Our aim was to analyze the NBSR to determine whether the effects of obesity surgery on associated co-morbidities observed in small randomized controlled clinical trials could be replicated in a ""real life"" setting within U.K. healthcare. Setting(s): United Kingdom. Method(s): All NBSR entries for operations between 2000 and 2015 with associated demographic and co-morbidity data were analyzed retrospectively. Result(s): A total of 50,782 entries were analyzed. The patients were predominantly female (78%) and white European with a mean age of 45 +/- 11 years and a mean body mass index of 48 +/- 8 kg/m2. Over 5 years of follow-up, statistically significant reductions in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, sleep apnea, asthma, functional impairment, arthritis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease were observed. The ""remission"" of these co-morbidities was evident 1 year postoperatively and reached a plateau 2 to 5 years after surgery. Obesity surgery was particularly effective on functional impairment and diabetes, almost doubling the proportion of patients able to climb 3 flights of stairs and halving the proportion of patients with diabetes related hyperglycemia compared with preoperatively. Surgery was safe with a morbidity of 3.1% and in-hospital mortality of.07% and a reduced median inpatient stay of 2 days, despite an increasingly sick patient population. Conclusion(s): Obesity surgery in the U.K. results not only in weight loss, but also in substantial improvements in obesity-related co-morbidities. Appropriate support and funding will help improve the quality of the NBSR data set even further, thus enabling its use to inform healthcare policy.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Bariatric Surgery"

Ongoing studies are needed for routine adoption of this practice given the multiple issues patients face with following difficult preoperative weight loss protocols., OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterize the prevalence of preoperative weight loss and evaluate its impact on outcomes following elective bariatric surgery., SETTING: This retrospective study was conducted using the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) data registry from 2015-2018., METHODS: All primary Roux-en-Y (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) procedures were included, whereas prior revisional surgeries and emergency surgeries were excluded. Cases were then divided into preoperative weight loss (PWL) and control cohorts. PWL was defined categorically if the highest 30-day preoperative weight was greater than the closest recorded weight before surgery. Primary outcomes included identifying the impact of PWL on postoperative complications. Multivariable logistic regression modelling was used to examine the influence of PWL on serious complications and mortality after adjusting for patient co-morbidities and procedure type., RESULTS: A total of 548,597 patients were identified with the majority experiencing preoperative weight loss (n= 459,500; 83.8%). The PWL cohort was older (44.8 +/- 12.0 versus 43.2 +/- 11.9 yr), had a reduced body mass index (BMI) (45.0 +/- 7.4 versus 46.1 +/- 7.6 kg/m2), and was more likely to be male (20.3% versus 18.7%). Patients with preoperative weight loss also were more likely to have metabolic co-morbidities including medication and insulin-dependent diabetes (27.0% versus 23.2%), hypertension (HTN) (48.9% versus 44.7%), dyslipidemia (DLP ) (24.6% versus 21.0%), and sleep apnea (39.6% versus 32.3%). No clinically significant differences were observed for operative length between cohorts (85.3 +/- 46.9 min PWL versus 83.9 +/- 46.2 min control). The protective benefit was found to be most significant for patients experiencing greatest weight loss with those experiencing a >10% PWL showing 30% decreased odds of leak (OR .68%; 95% CI [confidence interval] .56-.84; P < .0001) and a 40% decrease in odds of mortality versus those with no PWL (OR .60; 95% CI .39-.92; P = .02)., CONCLUSION: Preoperative weight loss before bariatric surgery is common, occurring in >80% of elective cases. Our findings suggest that preoperative weight loss is associated with improved odds of 30-day mortality and leaks but no differences in bleeds or overall serious complications. Additional prospective trials are needed to further evaluate the role of routine PWL in addition to ongoing development of tolerable preoperative weight-loss protocols.

Result(s): Modelling the trial outcomes demonstrated that greater reduction in ICP was predicted with greater weight loss, with 24% weight loss resulting in normalisation of ICP in this population. The effect on ICP further improves between 12 to 24 months as the participants continue to lose weight. For expected ICP values to cross the threshold for normal, at 25cmCSF within 2 years, it is generally required that the patient would be allocated to the bariatric surgery arm and achieve a weight of 110kg. Those with a higher starting weight needed to lose more weight to meaningfully reduce ICP. This model also demonstrated that in the CWI arm if no or little weight loss was achieved in those with a high baseline weight an increase in ICP would be expected. Conclusion(s): There should be care when exposing women with IIH and BMI>=35kg/m2 to repeated cycles of lifestyle interventions that fail to achieve adequate weight loss, as this approach is unlikely to achieve sustained remission of disease."

Sustained weight loss among patients with IIH is necessary to modify the disease and prevent relapse. Objective(s): To compare the effectiveness of bariatric surgery with that of a community weight management (CWM) intervention for the treatment of patients with active IIH. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This 5-year randomized clinical trial (Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Weight Trial) enrolled women with active IIH and a body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 35 or higher at 5 National Health Service hospitals in the UK between March 1, 2014, and May 25, 2017. Of 74 women assessed for eligibility, 6 did not meet study criteria and 2 declined to participate; 66 women were randomized. Data were analyzed from November 1, 2018, to May 14, 2020. Intervention(s): Bariatric surgery (n = 33) or CWM intervention (Weight Watchers) (n = 33). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was change in intracranial pressure measured by lumbar puncture opening pressure at 12 months, as assessed in an intention-to-treat analysis. Secondary outcomes included lumbar puncture opening pressure at 24 months as well as visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, perimetric mean deviation, and quality of life (measured by the 36-item Short Form Health Survey) at 12 and 24 months. Because the difference in continuous outcomes between groups is presented, the null effect was at 0. Result(s): Of the 66 female participants (mean [SD] age, 32.0 [7.8] years), 64 (97.0%) remained in the clinical trial at 12 months and 54 women (81.8%) were included in the primary outcome analysis. Intracranial pressure was significantly lower in the bariatric surgery arm at 12 months (adjusted mean [SE] difference, -6.0 [1.8] cm cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]; 95% CI, -9.5 to -2.4 cm CSF; P =.001) and at 24 months (adjusted mean [SE] difference, -8.2 [2.0] cm CSF; 95% CI, -12.2 to -4.2 cm CSF; P <.001) compared with the CWM arm. In the per protocol analysis, intracranial pressure was significantly lower in the bariatric surgery arm at 12 months (adjusted mean [SE] difference, -7.2 [1.8] cm CSF; 95% CI, -10.6 to -3.7 cm CSF; P <.001) and at 24 months (adjusted mean [SE] difference, -8.7 [2.0] cm CSF; 95% CI, -12.7 to -4.8 cm CSF; P <.001). Weight was significantly lower in the bariatric surgery arm at 12 months (adjusted mean [SE] difference, -21.4 [5.4] kg; 95% CI, -32.1 to -10.7 kg; P <.001) and at 24 months (adjusted mean [SE] difference, -26.6 [5.6] kg; 95% CI, -37.5 to -15.7 kg; P <.001). Quality of life was significantly improved at 12 months (adjusted mean [SE] difference, 7.3 [3.6]; 95% CI, 0.2-14.4; P =.04) and 24 months (adjusted mean [SE] difference, 10.4 [3.8]; 95% CI, 3.0-17.9; P =.006) in the bariatric surgery arm. Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, bariatric surgery was superior to a CWM intervention in lowering intracranial pressure. The continued improvement over the course of 2 years shows the impact of this intervention with regard to sustained disease remission.

This study aimed to evaluate the amount of weight loss required to reduce ICP in IIH. Method(s): Adult women with active IIH and a body mass index >= 35 kg/m2 were recruited. The relationship between ICP and weight loss was evaluated and categorised by the weight loss methods. A linear hierarchical regression model was used to fit the trial outcomes, adjusted for time, treatment arm and weight. Result(s): Weight loss was significantly associated with reduction in ICP (R2 = .4734, p <= .0001). Weight loss of 13.3 kg (standard deviation 1.76) was associated with disease remission (ICP <25 cmCSF). Normalisation of ICP occurred with 24% weight loss. At 12 months weight loss of between 5-10% caused a mean reduction in ICP of 4.4 cmCSF (standard error [SE] +/- 2.15); whereas weight loss of 20-30% caused a greater mean reduction in ICP of -15.4 cmCSF (SE +/- 2.89). Roux-en-Y gastric bypass achieved superior, more rapid and sustained ICP reduction in IIH. Conclusion(s): The extent of weight loss can predict reduction in ICP in IIH. The amount of weight loss needed (24%) is unlikely to be achieved through diet alone, and early referral to a bariatric pathway should be considered. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was the most effective surgical intervention to achieve remission in IIH."

This substudy aimed to evaluate the amount of weight loss required to reduce intracranial pressure and to explore the effect of different bariatric surgical approaches., METHODS: IIH:WT was a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Adult women with active idiopathic intracranial hypertension and a body mass index >=35 kg/m2 were randomized to bariatric surgery or a community weight management intervention (1:1). This per-protocol analysis evaluated the relationship between intracranial pressure, weight loss, and the weight loss methods. A linear hierarchical regression model was used to fit the trial outcomes, adjusted for time, treatment arm, and weight., RESULTS: Sixty-six women were included, of whom 23 had received bariatric surgery by 12 months; the mean age was 31 (SD 8.7) years in the bariatric surgery group and 33.2 (SD 7.4) years in the dietary group. Baseline weight and intracranial pressure were similar in both groups with a mean weight of 119.5 (SD 24.1) and 117.9 (SD 19.5) kg and mean lumbar puncture opening pressure of 34.4 (SD 6.3) and 34.9 (SD 5.3) cmCSF in the bariatric surgery and dietary groups, respectively.

The purpose of this study was to assess whether preoperative mandated weight loss goals lead to improved perioperative morbidity, postoperative weight loss, and resolution of comorbidities., METHODS: Data from patients who underwent primary laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) between October 2012 and October of 2015 was reviewed. Patients were divided in two groups: those with BMI of 35-45 were not required to achieve a weight loss goal prior to surgery (no-WLG group) while those with BMI > 45 were given a weight loss goal proportionate to their weight (WLG group). Body mass index (BMI), history of diabetes mellitus type-II (DM-II), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) were recorded at baseline and 4 years postoperatively. Length of hospital stay (LOS) and reinterventions were considered proxies for postoperative morbidity., RESULTS: A total of 776 patients, 81.4% LRYGB, were included in the study (age 45.1 +/- 11.9). There was no difference in %DELTABMI, DM-II, HDL, HTN, LOS, or reinterventions among the two groups at 4 years postoperatively in both LRNY and LSG patients. This lack of difference persisted even when patients with similar BMI (43-45 vs 45.01-47) were compared., CONCLUSION: WLG group did not have decreased perioperative morbidity, nor improved weight loss and comorbidity resolution 4 years after surgery. While these findings should also be confirmed by multicenter trials, they question the value of mandated WLG prior to bariatric surgery as they seem ineffective and may limit patient access to surgery."

The present study primarily investigates the difference between Vertical Sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) and Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) in achieving the composite target one year after the surgery. The secondary outcome assessed the success rate in achieving the separate components' target at months 6, 12 and 24 post-surgery. Method(s): This retrospective observational study evaluated 103 patients with obesity and T2D. At each visit, anthropometric measurements were recorded, and the metabolic and lipid profile was evaluated before surgery and subsequently during the follow-up visits at 6, 12 and 24 months postsurgery. Result(s): Twelve months after surgery, patients undergoing RYGB did not show a significant difference compared to those undergoing VSG in achieving the composite target (P =.57) . Patients undergoing RYGB showed greater LDL target achievement at 6 months post-surgery than the VSG (P=.005) . Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were significantly reduced over time in the RYGB compared to the VSG (P=.023 and P=.010 respectively) . Conclusion(s): RYGB and VSG showed similar efficacy in reaching the cardiometabolic ADA composite target in subjects with T2D undergoing bariatric surgery. Patients undergoing RYGB showed a significant reduction over time in LDL and total cholesterol compared to the VSG group. More extended randomized studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the two surgical procedures in the improvement and remission of cardiovascular risk factors associated with obesity."

We hypothesised that chewing gauze soaked with lidocaine would decrease the gag reflex during awake videolaryngoscope tracheal intubation. Twenty four morbidly obese patients assessed as having a potential difficult tracheal intubation were randomised to chew gauze soaked with 20 ml of 2% lidocaine or saline for 3 minutes. All patients then received 20 ml of aerosolised 2% lidocaine and underwent awake videolaryngoscope assisted tracheal intubation. Gagging scores, heart rate and blood pressure were assessed when best laryngeal view was obtained, when the tracheal tube was positioned at the cords, and when the tube was advanced into the trachea. In addition, serum lidocaine levels were measured. The primary outcome was the gagging score at best laryngeal visualisation, which was compared between groups with a Student's t_test. Gagging scores and hemodynamic parameters did not differ between groups, but the saline group had lower plasma levels of lidocaine after the intubation procedure. When used for awake videolaryngoscope assisted tracheal intubation of the morbidly obese, chewing lidocaine soaked gauze does not decrease the amount of gagging as compared to lidocaine aerosolisation, but does increase the plasma levels of lidocaine."

Mandated preoperative weight loss with a specific time frame remains a requirement for many bariatric surgery patients. There are limited Level 1 data for pre_operative weight loss for bariatric surgery. Here we present the first randomized trial examining the impact of adjuvant pharmaceutical therapy upon preoperative weight loss. Methods: 24 patients in one month consented to participate in the study with an enrollment goal of 70 patients. Study participants were randomized to low_dose phentermine (Lomaira¨) or placebo. Treatment was designated to be completed within a 60_90 day preoperative time period. Patients and surgeons were blinded regarding treatment assignment. Demographic and clinical data were collected at the patients' consult visit. On a weekly basis, dietary intake and physical activity were assessed with the HealthWatch 360 smartphone application and weight loss was recorded via a digital, connected scale. CT scans to assess liver volume and serological exams were scheduled at initial consult and again at preoperative visit. Mann_Whitney and Wilcoxon ttests were used to assess weight loss. Results: 14 and 10 patients were assigned to the Low_Dose Phentermine (LDP) treatment and placebo groups respectively. LDP and Placebo patients were on average 26 and 29 days respectively into their treatment. LDP patients were on average 43.42 ± 3.9 years old, and Placebo patients were on average 46.33 ± 3.5 (p=0.5974). LDP and Placebo patients had similar BMI (50.0 ± 2.3 vs. 47.0 ± 3.0, p=0.4259) and systolic blood pressure (136.4 ± 5.4 vs. 144.8 ± 8.8 mmHg, p=0.4025) at the first clinic visit. There were no differences between LDP and Placebo patients in initial liver volume (2131 vs. 2273 CC, p=0.8480) or daily caloric intake (1678 ± 215 vs. 1517 ± 224 calories, p=0.6888). LDP patients showed significant weight loss in terms of a change in BMI within a month of treatment (_1.4, p=0.0066), unlike Placebo patients (_0.3, p=0.2852). Additionally, there was a significant difference between LDP and Placebo patients in percentage of excess body weight loss within one month (6.3 ± 1.5% vs. 1.4 ± 1.5%, p=0.0465). Only one patient in the treatment group discontinued treatment, due to a feeling of noncardiac chest discomfort. Conclusions: This first randomized, double_blinded pharmaceutical pre_operative weight loss trial demonstrates in preliminary results that Low Dose Phentermine is a safe and effective in delivering significant weight loss within a month of treatment."

This report summarizes the safety and efficacy of vBloc therapy in the prespecified subgroup of patients with moderate obesity., METHODS: The ReCharge Trial is a double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial of participants with body mass index (BMI) of 40-45 or 35-40 kg/m(2) with at least one obesity-related comorbid condition. Participants were randomized 2:1 to implantation with either a vBloc or sham device with weight management counseling. Eighty-four subjects had moderate obesity (BMI 35-40 kg/m(2)) at randomization., RESULTS: Fifty-three participants were randomized to vBloc and 31 to sham. Qualifying obesity-related comorbidities included dyslipidemia (73%), hypertension (58%), sleep apnea (33%), and type 2 diabetes (8%). The vBloc group achieved a percentage excess weight loss (%EWL) of 33% (11% total weight loss (%TWL)) compared to 19% EWL (6% TWL) with sham at 12 months (treatment difference 14 percentage points, 95% CI, 7-22; p < 0.0001). Common adverse events of vBloc through 12 months were heartburn/dyspepsia and implant site pain; the majority of events were reported as mild or moderate., CONCLUSIONS: vBloc therapy resulted in significantly greater weight loss than the sham control among participants with moderate obesity and comorbidities with a well-tolerated safety profile."

Dexmedetomidine when used as an additive to general anesthesia blocks stress response to various noxious stimuli, maintains perioperative hemodynamic stability. Settings and design: Sixty patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy were divided randomly into two groups. The dexmedetomidine group (Group D), received dexmedetomidine infusion, while the control group (Group C) received normal saline 0.9% in the same amount and rate as placebo. In group D, dexmedetomidine was given intravenously (IV) as loading dose of 1 mug/kg over 10 min prior to induction. After induction, it was given as infusion at a dose of 0.5 mug/kg/h for maintenance. Perioperative blood sugar levels were analyzed preoperatively, at 30 min after beginning of surgery then hourly till surgery ends, and six h after surgery. Anesthetic and surgical procedures were standardized. All patients were also assessed for intraoperative hemodynamic changes at specific timings, intraoperative narcotic consumption and recovery profile. Results: Perioperative administration of dexmedetomidine infusion had essentially weakened the stress response. In the C group there was significantly higher blood sugar values compared to group D one hour after start of surgery up to 6 h later. Also, regarding hemodynamics there was significant reduction in heart rate (HR) and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) in D group. Conclusions: During the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, dexmedetomidine premedication has effectively regulated the neuroendocrine stress response of general anesthesia as analyzed by perioperative blood sugar variation. Also, it maintained the hemodynamic stability. Copyright © 2018"

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is the most widely performed bariatric surgery. Aim of the Work To evaluate patients who failed to lose weight or regained weight after perfonning sleeve gastrectomy and how to manage them. Patients and Methods This study has been conducted at Ain Shams university hospital (Al Demerdash hospital) Ain Shams University. This is a prospective randomized controlled study (RCT) where 30 patients (20 females and 10 males) attended the outpatient clinic of the bariatric surgery unit complaining of failure of sleeve gastrectomy defined as: (failure to lose 500 0 of excess body weight or regain up to 200 0 of lost excess weight within one year or more from sleeve gastrectomy). Results All three operations have promising outcomes regarding weight loss and comorbidities resolution like diabetes mellitus and hypertension in morbidly obese patients. When compared to RE-LSG, SADI and OAGB have better results regarding weight loss. Conclusion Weight loss failure and revisional surgery remain primary long term concern after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. There are currently no guidelines or systemic reviews directing the standered of practice tor revisional surgery in patients with failed primary sleeve gastrectomy."

The aim of this multicentre, RCT was to evaluate the impact of intraoperative GDT on major morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing transthoracic oesophagectomy. Methods: Adult patients undergoing transthoracic oesophagectomy were randomised to receive either minimally invasive intraoperative GDT (stroke volume variation <8%, plus systolic BP maintained >90 mm Hg by pressors as necessary) or haemodynamic management left to the discretion of attending senior anaesthetists (control group; systolic BP >90 mm Hg alone). The primary outcome was the incidence of death or major complications (reoperation for bleeding, anastomotic leakage, pneumonia, reintubation, >48 h ventilation). A Cox proportional hazard model was used to examine whether the effects of GDT on morbidity and mortality were independent of other potential confounders. Results: A total of 232 patients (80.6% male; age range: 36Ð83 yr) were randomised to either GDT (n=115) or to the control group (n=117). After surgery, major morbidity and mortality were less frequent in 22/115 (19.1%) subjects randomised to GDT, compared with 41/117 (35.0%) subjects assigned to the control group {absolute risk reduction: 15.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.7Ð27.2%); P=0.006}. GDT was also associated with fewer episodes of atrial fibrillation (odds ratio [OR]: 0.18 [95% CI: 0.05Ð0.65]), respiratory failure (OR: 0.27 [95% CI: 0.09Ð0.83]), use of mini_tracheotomy (OR: 0.29 [95% CI: 0.10Ð0.81]), and readmission to ICU (OR: 0.09 [95% CI: 0.01Ð0.67]). GDT was independently associated with morbidity and mortality (hazard ratio: 0.51 [95% CI: 0.30Ð0.87]; P=0.013). Conclusions: Intraoperative GDT may reduce major morbidity and mortality, and shorten hospital stay, after transthoracic oesophagectomy. Clinical trial registration: UMIN000018705"

Background(s): Obesity surgery can achieve remission of T2DM and its comorbidities. Metabolic surgery has been proposed as a treatment option for diabetic patients with BMI less than 35 kg/m2 but the efficacy of metabolic surgery has not been conclusively determined. Method(s): A systematic literature search identified randomized (RCT) and nonrandomized comparative observational clinical studies (OCS) evaluating surgical versus medical T2DM treatment in patients with BMI less than 35kg/m2. The primary outcome was T2DM remission. Additional analyses comprised glycemic control, BMI, HbA1c level, remission of comorbidities, and safety. Random effects meta-analyses were calculated and presented as weighted odds ratio (OR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Result(s): Five RCTs and 6 OCSs (706 total T2DM patients) were included. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 36 months. Metabolic surgery was associated with a higher T2DM remission rate (OR: 14.1, 95% CI: 6.7-29.9, P < 0.001), higher rate of glycemic control (OR: 8.0, 95% CI: 4.2-15.2, P < 0.001) and lower HbA1c level (MD: -1.4%, 95% CI -1.9% to -0.9%, P < 0.001) than medical treatment.

However, a large variation in postsurgery weight loss is seen. Physical activity promotes weight loss in nonsurgically treated subjects with obesity. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 6 months of supervised physical training following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) on body weight and cardiovascular risk markers., METHODS: Sixty participants eligible for RYGB were included. Six months post surgery, the participants were randomly assigned to either twice-weekly supervised physical training sessions in a fitness center (INT) or a control group (CON) for 26 weeks. Before surgery and 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery, the participants underwent an examination program that included anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, heart rate, blood samples, and an abdominal computed tomography scan., RESULTS: RYGB significantly reduced body weight and improved cardiovascular risk markers (all P < 0.01). The supervised physical training intervention resulted in a 4.2-kg (CI: -0.2 to -8.3 kg) lower body weight in INT compared with CON at the study end (P = 0.042). The high-density lipoprotein concentration was significantly higher in INT than in CON at the termination of the intervention, but this was not maintained at the 24-months examination., CONCLUSIONS: Physical training following RYGB improves weight loss and cardiovascular health.

Mild-obese patients appear to have more severe forms of T2D, where the mechanisms of glycemic control after a standard-RYGB may be insufficient. The elongation of the biliopancreatic limb may lead to greater stimulation of the distal intestine, alterations in bile acids and intestinal microbiota, among other mechanisms, leading to better metabolic outcomes. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the RYGB with a biliopancreatic limb of 200 cm in the control of T2D in patients with BMI 30-35 kg/m2., METHODS: From January 2011 to May 2015, 102 T2D patients with BMI from 30 to 34.9 kg/m2 underwent laparoscopic RYGB with the biliopancreatic-limb of 200 cm and the alimentary-limb of 50 cm., RESULTS: There were no deaths or reoperations. The mean follow-up was 28.1 months. The mean BMI dropped from 32.5 to 25.1 kg/m2, while the mean fasting glucose decreased from 182.9 to 89.8 mg/dl and the mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) went from 8.7 to 5.2%. During follow-up, 92.2% had their T2D under complete control (HbA1c < 6%, no anti-diabetic medications), while 7.8% were under partial control. Control of hypertension and dyslipidemia were 89.4 and 85.5%, respectively. No patient developed hypoalbuminemia, and there were mild micronutrient deficiencies., CONCLUSIONS: RYGB with long-biliopancreatic and short-alimentary limbs is safe and seems effective in achieving complete control of T2D in patients with BMIs between 30 and 35 kg/m2."

Even in the absence of hypertension, adiposity induces structural and functional changes in the heart through hemodynamic and non hemodynamic factors. In the ""obese"" heart, besides the growth of cardiomyocytes, interstitial fat infiltration and triglyceride accumulation in the contractile elements importantly contribute to left-ventricular mass (LVM) accrual, hypertrophy (LVH) and geometric pattern. In harmony with this, the likelihood of LVH is greater in either obese normotensive or hypertensive individuals than in their non-obese counterparts. Interestingly, recent observations highlight the increasing prevalence of the ""concentric"" (ie, combined remodeling and hypertrophy), rather than ""eccentric"" pattern of LV geometry in obesity. Nonetheless, obesity is linked with lack of decrease, or even increase, of LVM over time, independently of blood pressure control and hypertensive treatment. Although obesity-related LV changes result in progressive systolic and diastolic heart failure, the assessment of LVM and LVH in obese individuals still remains a difficult task. In this scenario, it is tempting to speculate that therapeutic interventions for reversal of LVH in obesity should either overcome the ""non-hemodynamic"" factors or reduce the hemodynamic load. Indeed, weight loss, either achieved by lifestyle changes or bariatric procedures, decreases LVM and improves LV function regardless of blood pressure status. These and other mechanistic insights are discussed in this review, which focuses on ""adipose dysfunction"" as potential instigator of, and putative therapeutic target for, LVH regression in the setting of obesity.Copyright © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland."

IHC was introduced in randomly chosen eight patients and, in the remaining five patients, chemotherapy was designed under conventional conditions. A common regimen comprising 5_fluorouracil, adriamycin, mitomycin C was applied in both the IHC and non_IHC groups. The clinical effect in these patients, assessed prior to surgery, gave rise to the confirmation of three CR patients in the IHC group, while in the non_IHC, PR was the highest score. Histological examination illuminated a patient in the IHC group in whom no viable carcinoma cell proved to remain in the excised stomach, a state meeting the requirements for the highest (Grade 3) effectiveness according to the standard given by the Japanese Research Society for Gastric Cancer. In another two patients of the same group, the effect was Grade 2, i.e., the degeneration and loss of carcinoma cells in the major part of tumor. In contrast, the effect in the non_IHC group was Grade 1b at the highest, where chemotherapy_associated degeneration and necrosis did not predominate over one third of tumor area. Thus, the mean histological score was apparently higher in the IHC than in the non_IHC group, with a difference significant at p less than 0.05 by Wilcoxon's test. Patients clinically evaluated as effective tended to be so pathologically as well, as shown by Spearman's rank correlation test which gave a significant correlation between the clinical and pathological scores."

Evidence suggests that this disease commonly progresses more rapidly in youth compared with adults and is associated with high rates of early microalbuminuria, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) study was the first multiethnic, multicenter randomized trial in the United States to compare 3 treatment approaches in obese youth with new-onset type 2 diabetes (n=699; ages 10-17 years): monotherapy with metformin, metformin with rosiglitazone, and metformin with an intensive lifestyle intervention. The primary outcome was glycemic control. Diabetes-related complications and cardiovascular risk factors were also examined. Approximately half of the participants could not maintain glycemic control by using metformin alone. Combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone resulted in better durability of glycemic control, and metformin plus intensive lifestyle intervention was intermediate but not superior to metformin alone. Deterioration in glycemic control was associated with rapid loss of beta cell function, not worsened insulin sensitivity, and could not be explained by differences in adherence or body mass index. After 3.9 years, 236 (33.8%) of participants had hypertension and 116 participants (16.6%) had microalbuminuria. Only 55.9% of participants had a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level less than 100 mg/dL (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259) after 3 years, and 71 of 517 participants (13.7%) had retinopathy. The significance of the findings from this important trial for the management of youth and young adults with youth-onset type 2 diabetes and its complications is discussed.

Nct	LOSS- Louisiana Obese Subjects Study	2005		CN-02030717	"LOSS is a pragmatic clinical trial designed to evaluate intensive medical treatment for patients with severe obesity who would otherwise qualify as candidates for obesity surgery and who are covered by the Louisiana Office of Group Benefits (OGB) Health Insurance. LOSS will track the efficacy, safety and costs to compare two patient management approaches _ intensive medical treatment, or a usual medical care treatment model. Recruitment will be done by mailers to insured patients to identify eligible candidates. We will randomly assign eligible volunteers to intensive medical treatment (n=240) or usual care (n=240). Patients will be evaluated annually and medical treatments are given in eight clinics around Louisiana. The eight sites are in Alexandria, Baton Rouge, Lafayette, Lake Charles, Monroe, Hammond, New Orleans and Shreveport. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that we can achieve weight loss after two and five years that exceeds 20% from baseline with intensive medical management of persons with class III obesity and that this weight loss is greater than that achieved with usual medical care including access to a weight management web site. Our secondary hypotheses are: 1) that the weight loss at year 2 and 5 in the intensive medical group is associated with improvements in blood pressure, fasting glucose, lipids, health_related quality of life and psychosocial measures and is greater improvement than that achieved with usual medical care and access to a website; and 2) that total medical costs in the intensive medical management group will compare favorably to total medical costs in the usual care group (i.e., total reimbursement from insurance costs will be less, even when the expense of the treatment is considered). Overall Aim: The overarching aim of this study is to observe the effect of an intensive medical management program versus usual care for class III obesity on weight loss, total medical costs and, on measures of health risks associated with weight loss (blood pressure, blood glucose, blood lipids, and health_related quality of life). Specific Aims: Primary: The primary specific aim of the LOSS study is to test the hypothesis that the weight loss efficacy at years 2 and 5 for an intensive medical treatment program for Class III obesity produces greater weight loss, as compared to a condition of usual care. Secondary: The secondary aims of the study are: _ To evaluate the percent change in body weight, absolute change in body weight (kilograms) and percent excess weight lost from baseline at months 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 for medically treated patient groups, and at years 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 for both groups. _ To evaluate the number and proportion of subjects who maintain 100% and 80% of 12 months weight lost at months 24, 36, 48 and 60 for medically treated patients and at years 2, 3, 4 and 5 for both groups. _ To evaluate the changes from baseline in blood pressure, pulse rate, and efficacy laboratory parameters at visits on months 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 for the medically treated patient group, and at years 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 for both groups. _ To assess the safety and tolerability of the intervention regimens at months 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 for the medically treated patient group. _ To assess the total medical costs of the participants treated with intensive medical treatment and for the patients receiving usual care at years 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. _ To assess additional psychosocial and economic measures (health_related quality of life, pain, depression, and stress) for the intervention group at months 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months for both groups at years 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. _ To compare subgroups of patients with class III obesity to determine if differences in outcome exist for gender, race, education level, decades of age and presence of co_morbid conditions.

Nct	Organ Protection for Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG): propofol Versus Desflurane	2006		CN-01513459	"Aims To investigate whether there are differences in postoperative cognitive function, total morbidity or cost, following cardiac surgery determined by the use of either propofol or desflurane as the primary anaesthetic agent. Hypothesis The null hypothesis is that there are no differences in postoperative cognitive function, total morbidity or economic cost based on the type of primary anaesthetic delivered. Participants: Following human ethics committee approval, and informed written consent, 180 patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery will be randomized to receive desflurane or propofol as the primary anaesthetic agent during surgery. This will be conducted at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Data will be collected preoperatively, intraoperatively and throughout the entire hospital stay, and including a three_month follow_up. Eligibility criteria Inclusion Criteria Adult male and female patients aged 18 years or older, undergoing on_pump elective coronary artery bypass surgery with general anaesthesia. 1. Off_pump cardiac surgery 2. Require surgery for acute coronary syndrome 3. Dialysis dependent renal dysfunction 4. Severe liver dysfunction as determined by liver transaminases 1.5X greater than normal. 5. Pre_existing diagnosis of schizophrenia, dementia recent stroke or cognitive disorder 6. Recent alcohol/drug abuse/intoxication 7. Re_do Coronary Artery Grafts 8. Coronary Artery Grafts plus other surgery Interventions Patients will receive either propofol or desflurane as the primary anaesthetic agent for the duration of this surgery. The following minor differences between groups are outlined: 1. For anaesthesia induction, the desflurane group will receive inhalational sevoflurane, as desflurane is pungent and irritant to the airway making inhalational induction of anaesthesia difficult. Following induction of anaesthesia with sevoflurane, the anaesthetic will be changed to desflurane at 0.5_2 MAC as necessary (this will include desflurane administration during cardiopulmonary bypass via the oxygen inlet to the circuit). 2. Patients in the propofol group will have general anaesthesia induced and maintained by propofol (effect site steering using an Asena TCI pump and levels maintained from 1.5_3µg/ml using the Marsh pharmacokinetic profile). No volatile anaesthesic agent will be allowed in this group including during CPB. The following anaesthesia, surgery, cardiopulmonary bypass, and sedation techniques will be common for both groups: 1. Anaesthesia co_induction / sedation with fentanyl (2_5 ug/kg) and midazolam (0.025_ 0.05mg/kg). Following induction of anaesthesia, patients will be maintained on a combined intravenous infusion of fentanyl (1.5 ug/kg/hr) and midazolam (0.025_0.05 mg/kg/hr) with Fi02=1. 2. Anaesthesia monitoring: In addition to specified routine anaesthetic monitoring as per Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists guidelines for general anaesthesia (38), all patients will have intra_arterial pressure monitoring, pulmonary artery (PA) pressure monitoring, nasopharyngeal temperature monitoring and transoesophageal echocardiography. These are standard monitoring for patients undergoing cardiac surgery at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Endpoints Primary Endpoint _ neurological protection 1. Neurocognitive function testing (preoperative, prior to hospital discharge, and at 3 months postoperation) Secondary Endpoints 1. Delirium as assessed by confusion assessment method (CAM). 2. In_hospital morbidity as determined by composite morbidity score Tertiary endpoints 1. Cost of post_operative care The following endpoints are cumulative and reported for the entire hospital stay: 3. Hemodynamic management: metaraminol or nitro_glycerin can be administered to control systemic arterial blood pressure within a systolic arterial pressure range of 100_140 mmHg. Beta blockade can be used at the anaesthetists discretion for either haemodynamic control, or management of ventricular arrhythmias. 5. Post CPB hemodynamic management: Cardiac output will be measur d by a thermodilution technique. Dobutamine can be administered for low cardiac output (cardiac index less than 2.0 L/min/m2) and noradrenaline can be used for low SVR syndrome if felt appropriate by anaesthetist, surgeon, or intensivist concerned. 6. Postoperative sedation: following skin closure, all anaesthesia agents will be ceased. A low dose propofol infusion will be permitted for postoperative ICU sedation until they are suitable for extubation.The aim is for a Ramsay sedation score of 2 upon initial return to ICU then once haemodynamically stable, to aim for a score of 4. Patients will be escorted to the intensive care unit and will be ventilated until they have achieved accepted standard criteria for extubation (awake and co_operative, warm, haemodynamically stable, PaCO2<50mmHg, PaO2> 100 on FiO2 = 0.4). Patients will be allowed to awaken in ICU and extubated. 7. Rescue protocol: In both groups additional rescue analgesia will be allowed in the form of fentanyl, or morphine, paracetamol, tramadol, or indomethacin as necessary to provide adequate analgesia. Composite morbidity/mortality score This will be a weighted morbidity score. It will score 3 points for death, 2 points for a major morbid outcome and 1 point for any minor outcome. Major morbid outcome is defined as any outcome that is permanent (e.g. stroke) or has a natural history in that it could lead to death, but without actually causing death. It is derived from morbidity likely to result from inadequate tissue perfusion or immunomodulation. Economics Hospital economics will be assessed on multiple criteria; 1. Time spent in ICU 2. Time spent in hospital 3. Cost of all blood products 4. Re_operation 5. Pathology and other investigations needed while in hospital 6. Cost of drugs administered Cost/economics estimations are taken from Australian published studies and index to 2006 prices. Investigation tests are based on rebates from the Medical benefit schedule. Both are listed below. The cost of re_operation is based on theatre time for four hours indexed to 2006 prices, and do not include doctors fees. The number of hospital days which will be charged as the hospital length of stay _ ICU time. The actual cost of the operation are ""fixed costs"" (this only relates to the primary operation and not to reoperations). The cost that we are looking at, therefore are potentially variable costs which may be impacted upon by the possible use of volatile anaesthesia, or propofol. Obviously a return to OR would involve costs involving OR time, disposables including CPB circuits, and drugs (including aprotinin and recombinant factor VIIa). Sample size Estimates of power and minimal group size were obtained by performing a forward looking power analysis based upon the ability to show a significant difference in neurocognitive testing. This is based on our previous study showing a 38% incidence of neurocognitive abnormality in a group consistent with the propofol arm, and aiming for an effect size reduction of 50%. For an 80% power to reject the null hypothesis of no significance (P<0.05) in each group, the sample size is 90 patients in each group. Randomization The treating anaesthetist will allocate randomization by the sealed envelopes method. Implementation The patients will be recruited by professional research staff. Randomization will be implemented by the treating anaesthetist. 4. Cardiopulmonary bypass: the venous reservoir of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit will be primed with 2L of crystalloid solution (Plasma_lyte(R) Baxter Healthcare) and maintained at a temperature of 35 degrees Celsius. Cardiopulmonary bypass will be performed in a standardized technique with cannulation of the ascending aorta and with a single two_staged right atrial_caval cannula with non_assisted venous drainage. After initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass the patient's nasopharyngeal temperature will be allowed to drift progressively down to 34 degrees Celsius at which point it will be maintained by a heat exchanger until rewarming is initiated. Patients' haemoglo in will be maintained above 70 g/l. The ascending aorta will be cross_clamped and cardiac arrest will be induced by administration of tepid blood cardioplegia at a temperature ranging from 20_25 degrees Celsius. The ratio of blood to the initial crystalloid cardioplegia required to achieve arrest will be 4:1 in order to obtain a potassium concentration in the induction cardioplegia of at least 20 mmol/l. Arrest will be achieved by antegrade administration of cardioplegia through an aortic root catheter, followed by retrograde administration through a coronary sinus catheter. Left ventricular distension will be monitored for by transoesophageal echocardiography. Further doses of maintenance cardioplegia are given following completion of graft anastomoses. Rewarming of the patient will commence at the beginning of the last distal anastomosis (or 15 minutes prior to aortic cross clamp removal). The temperature of the heat exchanger used to achieve this will not exceed 37 degrees Celsius. Atrial pacing wires will be attached if electrical activity has not been established after 5 minutes of reperfusion or if pre_operative heart rate is less than 60 per minute or if the patient is on B_adrenergic antagonists. The patient will remain on full cardiopulmonary bypass support for a period of time approximately equal to 20_25% of cross clamp time or until the anaesthetist, perfusionist, and surgeon are satisfied that cardiac function is appropriate to achieve separation. Blinding The study will be open label for the treating anaesthetist who will also collect intraoperative data, and patient (as they will either have an inhalational induction or an intravenous induction, blinding is not possible), Preoperative and postoperative data will be collected by professional research staff who will be blinded to the treatment protocol. Statistical methods Continuous data collected over repeated measurement intervals will be examined by repeated measures ANOVA and adjusted for multisample asphericity by applying the Greenhouse Geisser correction. Categorical data will be analysed using Fischer's Exact test. Data will be corrected for multiple comparisons within families of endpoints using the Ryan_Holm Bonferroni correction. Intention to treat analysis will be performed. A blinded interim analysis of results will be performed by the data safety monitoring committee upon conclusion of enrolment of 80 patients. Stopping values to terminate the study will be set at a P value < 0.001 for primary endpoints. Timeline We anticipate initial recruitment will be complete 15_18 months following trial commencement. Follow up will be complete 3 month after the last enrollment. Data validation, statistical analysis and manuscript preparation will be complete by 24 months."
Nct	Antenatal Rescue Course of Glucocorticoids in Threatened Premature Birth	2006		CN-02013198	"RANDOMIZED TRIAL ON EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF THE ANTENATAL RESCUE COURSE OF GLUCOCORTCOID IN THREATENED PREMATURE BIRTH (ACG trial) Introduction Prematurity is the main cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Immature infants have many serious diseases such as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), chronic lung disease (CLD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Corticosteroids have the maturational effects on fetal cardiovascular, respiratory, nervous and gastrointestinal systems (1). Antenatal corticosteroids (ANC) have been widely used for prevention of RDS and other serious diseases in preterm infants since 1972Õs, when the controlled trial of antepartum glucocorticoid treatment was published. Administration of s of 12 mg of betamethasone given twice intramuscularly 24 hours apart has shown to be effective (2,3,4,39). Strong evidence exists for neonatal benefits from a complete course of ANC starting at 24 hours and lasting up to 7 days after treatment (2,39). Betamethasone and dexamethasone have similar biological activity and both are associated with a significant reduction in the risk of RDS, but only betamethasone with a significant decrease of the neonatal mortality. The clinical benefit had not been documented beyond 7 days after the onset of ANC therapy. (1,2) Several randomized studies have shown that a single course of antenatal corticosteroid treatment improves the survival of preterm infants born at 24_34 weeks gestation and decreases the incidence of RDS, ICH and NEC. ANC therapy reduces the incidence of RDS by approximately 50%.(1,2) ANC treatment also reduces the need of exogenous surfactant (4). The protective effect against RDS is thought to be due to the structural maturation of the lungs, increased surfactant synthesis, improved resistance to lung injury and improved cardiovascular adaptation. Glucocorticoid speeds up the normal thinning of the gas_exchange walls with double capillary loops between the air sacs. ANC thus accelerates the structural development of the respiratory airways, but reduces the number of alveoli. Glucocorticoid increases surfactant synthesis by enhancing maturation of the surfactant_ producing type II pneumocytes and stimulating the secretion of surfactant complex (1,6,7,8,9,40). Serial doses of ANC may possibly downregulate steroid receptors resulting in decreased or disordered surfactant production.(ref) ANC has not been shown to decrease the incidence of CLD at 28 days of age either in the meta_analysis or in the recent retrospective studies (2,13,14,15). ANC treatment is associated with maturation of the cardiovascular system and normalisation of the low blood pressure in the small premature infant at birth.(ref) This influence was evident after administration of surfactant.(4) According to meta_analysis, ANC had no effect on the incidence of PDA. However in several studies, use of ANC was associated with increased spontaneous closure of PDA(2,3,4, ). ANC decreases the incidence of ICH in preterm infants (2,3,4). Severe prematurity decreases autoregulation of the cerebral circulation and predisposes to ICH or cerebral ischemia. Glucocorticoids accelerate differentiation of neuronal cells and possibly enhance maturation of germinal matrix vessels (1,33,34). ANC therapy has been associated also with a lower incidence of periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) and cerebral palsy (CP), but these effects were not significant in CrowleyÕs meta_analysis (2,3,4,5). In a recently published retrospective study, antenatal administration of betamethasone was associated with a decreased risk of PVL compared to antenatal dexamethasone or no treatment (17). Specific aim and hypothesis Study design Present study is a multicenter, randomized, blinded, placebo_controlled trial comparing the benefits and side effects of single vs. second rescue course of antenatal corticosteroid. Betamethasone is clinically used as a mixture of betamethasone phosphate (6 mg) and betamethasone acetate (6 mg), providing a rapi exposure from the phosphate form and a sustained exposure from the acetate form. Maximal fetal serum level of betamethasone was attained 1_2 hours after ANC treatment (27). The half life of antenatally administered betamethasone is about 12 hours in fetal circulation (1,36). Decrease in the incidence of RDS is evident when ANC is administered between 24 hours and 7 days before delivery. However, the incidence of ICH is decreased even with treatment initiated less than 24 hours prior to delivery (2,3,4). According to the animal studies the short term ANC (<24 hours) improves the postnatal lung function, decreases the protein leak into the lung and alters postnatal blood pressure regulation in the premature. ANC also seems to augment the postnatal neuroendocrine and endocrine responses to hypoxic challenge (28,29,30). According to meta_analysis there is no significant decrease in birthweight and in physical or psychological development at the age 3_12 years following a single course of ANC treatment of fetuses (2,18,19). According to follow_up studies, prenatal single course of steroid treatment is safe and enhanced survival is not associated with a higher incidence of disabilities or developmental disturbances in survivors during childhood and young adulthood (2,3,5,18,19,35). Single course of ANC treatment did not increase the risk of fetal or neonatal infections or the incidence of maternal infections (2). When administered during the subclinical chorioamnionitis, ANC treatment seem to decrease the incidence of RDS, ICH, PVL and neonatal mortality without apparent increase in neonatal sepsis (32). However, there is concern about possible negative effect of multiple course of ANC on birthweight, head circumference and growth later in childhood. Data from numerous animal studies suggest that ANC has a negative effect on pre_ and postnatal growth. Most studies deal with rodents who have a short gestation and period of growth (10,11,12,37). In animal studies multidose ANC exposure has also decreased lung growth, which seems to be irreversible and persistent into adulthood (10,11,12). Also, in several animal studies ANC exposure has shown decreased brain growth and cell proliferation, which may also be due to short duration of gestation and long duration of exposure (10,11,12,37). There are concerns about potential suppressive effects of ANC on the fetal hypothalamus_pituitary_adrenal axis. Transient suppression of the pituitary_adrenal glands in preterm infants whose mothers have received 1_2 doses of antenatal glucocorticoid, reportedly recovers within 7 days of life (23,24,25,26,36). Infants delivered shortly after one course of ANC are normally responsive to stress after birth (e.g. RDS and asphyxia).(36) Clinical practice administering antenatal corticosteroids varies greatly between individual centers during the late 1990Õs. The practice of repeating the course of ANC has become widespread. However the safety or efficacy of serial courses of glucocorticoid is not known. According to recently published non_randomized studies there is conflicting data on growth and neonatal morbidity of infants exposed to single vs. multiple course of ANC (13,14,15). There is also concern particularly in women with prolonged premature rupture of fetal membranes (PPROM) that repetitive doses may increase maternal and fetal infections (21,22). In a retrospective study the multiple course of ANC was associated with an increased incidence of maternal postpartum infections (13). Entry criteria The pregnant women will be eligible for the trial entry if all following criteria are met: _ administration of a course of antenatal corticosteroid at least 7 days before the trial entry The effect of multiple courses of ANC on the HPA_axis is not well known. In recent studies a mild adrenal suppression was evident in some of the preterm infants whose mothers received more than eight courses of ANC (15). It has also been proposed that perinatal stress and exposure to corticosteroids induces long lasting changes in HPA_axis a d is associated with a decrease in stress induced CRH release in adulthood (24,34). However, there is no existing data about function of HPA_axis in young adults, who have been exposed to antenatal corticosteroids during fetal life. There is insufficient data about optimal interval of ANC administration. According to recent studies there is not additive positive effects of the practice of repeating the course of ANC at 7 days intervals. However, it is known that the positive influence of the one course of ANC is not evident after 7 days of administration. It is interesting whether one additional rescue course of ANC given within 24 hours before premature delivery is more effective than single course of ANC. No prospective studies or randomized, controlled trials comparing single versus second rescue course of antenatal corticosteroids have been published. The present aim is to study whether in recipients of ANC a single dose of betamethasone given shortly before spontaneous or elective premature birth (gestation 24 + 0 Ð 33 + 6 wk) improves the neonatal outcome without causing serious side effects. According to protocol, aim is to start the placebo or the second rescue course of ANC in 48 hours before expected delivery. The first hypothesis states that administration of second rescue course of ANC is more effective than the single course of ANC in increasing the intact survival at term of all infants without major neonatal morbidity, defined by the protocol. The principal outcome is survival of premature infants without major morbidity until the age of 36+0 weeks and survival of infants born at term during early neonatal period without the major morbidity, as defined by the protocol. _ gestational age is less than 33.0 weeks 6 days* _ very high risk of premature delivery** _ none of the following therapies complications or therapies maternal long term systemic corticosteroid therapy severe clinical chorioamnionitis (maternal fever, increased CRP or another acute phase protein, uterine tenderness) lethal disease of the fetus _ informed consent obtained _ premature rupture of membranes is not contraindication for the trial entry *Gestational age will be calculated from the motherÕs last menstrual period and confirmed by ultrasound before 20 weeksÕ gestation. In case the discrepancy in the estimates exceeds two weeks, ultrasound date is accepted. **Very high risk of premature delivery is described as follows: _ elective delivery within within 4_48 hours, as indicated by the obstetrician on the basis of the clinical status of the mother and/or the fetus _ very high risk of spontaneous delivery within 4_48 hours, i.e. _ cervix is open > 3 cm _ contractions of the uterus at 5_10 min intervals _ rupture of the membranes after the first course of ANC _ fetal and/or maternal indication for elective premature delivery or cesarean section Trial entry The investigator or his/her designated representative will evaluate the pregnant women for the above eligibility criteria. Administration of one course of antenatal glucocorticoid identifies the pregnant mothers that are potentially eligible to present study. Oral and written informed consent will be obtained from the women (if appropriate). The study entry (randomization and administration of the drug) takes place when all entry criteria are met. The parturient and her randomization number will be recorded on the trial data form and on patient records to enable later description of the women and to assist follow up. At the time of delivery the infants of the trial participants will be recorded to the trial data form and on patient records. Randomization The eligible women will be randomly and blindly assigned to receive either betamethasone or saline placebo. The randomization will take place separately in each Center according to the following strata: I gestation at entry less than 28.0 weeks + 0 days and singleton pregnancy II gestation at entry 28.0 weeks + 0 days or more but less than 33.0 weeks + 6 days and singleton pregnancy III gestation at ntry less than 28.0 weeks + 0 days and multiple pregnancy IV gestation at entry 28.0 weeks + 0 days or more but less than 33.0 weeks + 6 days and multiple pregnancy Study intervention The first course of ANC prior to the trial entry will be given according to the clinical indications of the Center. Administration of further courses of ANC before the trial entry will disqualify the mother from the ACG trial. The study course of betamethasone or placebo will be given to each eligible woman at least 7 days after the first course of ANC. After the entry criteria are met betamethasone (12mg) or placebo (normal saline) will be drawn to a sealed syringe containing the randomization number. The drug or placebo is administered intramuscularly. Within 1 hour the betamethasone dose increases the fetal serum levels of glucocorticoid to those obtained during neonatal stress Other obstetric and neonatal management Other management given to the participating women will be decided by the obstetrician. After the entry to the trial administration of ANC outside study protocol is not allowed. In an event premature delivery did not occur after ACG, any further administration of ANC is not indicated. The premature infants are treated in whatever way their condition demands, the decision is made by pediatrician. The ACG trial infants born after 33.0 + 6 weeks of pregnancy are included in the neonatal and the follow_up studies. Fetuses that died after the trial entry will be recorded. The pathologic examination of these fetuses is strongly encouraged. Measurement of outcome Primary outcome of the trial: Term birth or survival of the infants at the gestational age of 36.0 weeks + 0 days without any of the following: RDS need of supplemental oxygen > 48 h or surfactant therapy and characteristic radiographic findings Severe ICH (grades 3_4) infants born in term will be evaluated by ultrasound Maternal_antenatal outcomes: Clinical chorioamnionitis Any maternal infection Fetal death Secondary outcomes after birth: Treatments requirements: surfactant postnatal steroids indomethacin for PDA PDA surgery Primary outcome at follow up study Secondary outcomes during the follow_up: Growth characteristics during the first two years of corrected age Recurrent infections Reactive airway disease Hospital treatment during early childhood Data collection Clinical status will be assessed at the time of discharge. The cause of death will be defined when possible at autopsy. The surviving children will be studied at two years of age (corrected for gestational age). Their growth and neurodevelopment will be evaluated using a questionnaire and a clinical evaluation. CLD requirement of supplemental oxygen at 36 weeksÕ postmenstrual age PVL (gr 3_4) Severe NEC (Bell stages 3_4) perforation of the intestine intestinal pneumatosis air in portal vein ROP according to The International Classification of Retinopathy of Prematurity Neonatal infections early neonatal infections (onset < 72 hours) proven nosocomial bacterial or fungal sepsis during neonatal period (days 3_28) Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation Number of days on assisted ventilation Number of days on supplemental oxygen Duration of primary hospital stay Growth characteristics at birth Survival without neurologic, sensory or neuromotor impairment at the age 2 years, corrected for gestation. All infants will be studied. For the high_risk group, the following indices and studies will be performed: Mental Development Index (MDI) (<70) Psychomotor development will be measured by Bayley Scale (PDI) Behavioral development index (percentile) Definition of abnormalities in neurological status, speech development, major visual handicap and hearing defect Information will be collected at the time of delivery, during the hospital stay and when the baby leaves the hospital or dies. Perinatal data will include prenatal history, assessment of entry criteria and following information of postnatal condition: blood pressure monitoring, assessment of growth at birth, day 28 and at 36 weeks gestational ag (height, weight and head circumference). Cranial ultrasound will be made on all infants at least between days 4_8 of life and at 36.0 w + 0 d (± 3 days) gestational age or before discharge. The worst grade of ICH and PVL will be reported. The first ophthalmologic examination for retinopathy of prematurity will be done 4 to 7 weeks after birth or at 32 weeks gestational age. Sample size justification The primary goal of the study is to detect the effects of two vs. single course of ANC on survival without RDS and/or severe ICH (grade 3_4) by 36 weeks + 0 days of gestational age. Sample size analysis is based on morbidity and mortality from the Finnish perinatal statistics (National Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health) and from Vermont Oxford Network Database (VON). We estimate that a second additional dose of betamethasone would increase the survival without RDS and severe ICH from 50% to 62.5%. According to power analysis the sample size of 220 women would be required in each arm to reject the null hypothesis with and _ of 0.05 and power of 80%. The aim of the follow up study is to find out that one course of ANC result in equal or better neurodevelopmental outcome at the corrected age of two years, compared a single course of ANC. Statistical analysis Primary outcome Analysis of the primary outcomes will be based on an intention to treat analysis of all randomized subjects. Another analysis will be performed excluding infants who had congenital lethal malformation that was not detected at the onset. The outcome will be compared for the two vs. single course of ANC using the Mantel_Haenszel chi square test stratifying by the prenatal variables. Secondary outcomes The frequencies of categorical outcomes will be compared using appropriate chi square tests. The growth parameters, duration of ventilation, supplemental oxygen administration and hospitalization will be compared using analysis of variance or nonparametric tests when applicable. Survival rate will be compared using chi square tests and survival to term using survival analysis. Interim analysis The neonatal and the follow_up results for adverse outcomes will be prepared by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee when altogether 350 study infants have reached to the term or when the trial has been going on for 24 months, whichever comes first. Ethical considerations A written informed consent will be obtained from all the parents of the infants before the enrollment. The participation in the study does not cause any extra cost to the mother or the family. Participation is voluntary and withdrawing from the study is possible whenever desired during the pregnancy, the hospital stay or during the follow up period. Withdrawal does not affect the treatment or the follow up of the infant or the mother. If desired, approval from the ethical committees of each participating center will be obtained. Publication policy The perinatal_neonatal trial and the follow up study will be published separately. The list of authors includes Antenatal Multiple Betamethasone Trial Study Group (AMBTS). Each participant of the study from each Center will be listed. Each Center has an antenatal and a postnatal trial coordinator. Ancillary studies The participants are free to perform ancillary studies provided that a separate protocol, submitted together with the present one, is accepted by the local ethics committees."
Nct	Stent vs. Angioplasty for Treatment of Thrombosed AV Grafts: long-Term Outcomes	2007		CN-01498093	"HYPOTHESES 1. The primary patency of grafts following thrombectomy and angioplasty is limited by the high re_stenosis rate. 2. Stent deployment reduces the likelihood of re_stenosis at the site of the stenotic lesion, thereby prolonging primary graft patency following thrombectomy, and decreasing or delaying the need for future interventions. 3. The cost savings arising from stent deployment (decrease in subsequent access procedures) outweigh the additional cost of the stent itself. AIMS 1. To evaluate whether stent placement in thrombosed grafts with underlying stenosis at the venous anastomosis results in longer primary graft patency, as compared with angioplasty alone. 2. To determine whether stent placement in thrombosed grafts with underlying stenosis at the venous anastomosis reduces the subsequent cost of access procedures in excess of the cost of the stent. To accomplish these goals, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial of hemodialysis patients who are referred for treatment of thrombosed A_V grafts. The patients will be randomized to be treated with thrombectomy + stent deployment or thrombectomy + angioplasty. The primary outcomes will be primary (unassisted) graft patency. The secondary outcomes will be secondary (assisted) graft patency and the cumulative cost of all access_related procedures, hospitalizations, and complications. SIGNIFICANCE AND BACKGROUND Most patients with end_stage renal disease undergo hemodialysis thrice weekly to optimize their survival, minimize medical complications, and enhance their quality of life. A reliable vascular access is a critical requirement for providing adequate hemodialysis. The ideal vascular access would be easy to place, ready to use as soon as it is placed, deliver high blood flows indefinitely, and be free of complications. None of the existing types of vascular accesses achieve this ideal. Among the three types of vascular access currently available, A_V fistulas are superior to A_V grafts, which in turn are superior to dialysis catheters. Recognizing the relative merits of the vascular access types, the NKF_DOQI guidelines recommend placement of A_V fistulas in 50% of hemodialysis patients, A_V grafts in 40%, and dialysis catheters in 10% [19]. The actual current distribution of vascular accesses among prevalent hemodialysis patients in the United States is 25_30% fistulas, 45_50% grafts, and 25% dialysis catheters [20, 21]. Vascular access procedures and their subsequent complications represent a major cause of morbidity, hospitalization and cost for chronic hemodialysis patients [22_26]. Over 20% of hospitalizations in hemodialysis patients in the United States are access_related, and the annual cost of access morbidity is close to $1 billion [25]. A small, randomized study comparing stents with conventional angioplasty found no difference in primary graft patency following the intervention [54]. However, this study enrolled a mixture of clotted grafts and patent grafts, and the stenotic lesions were at a variety of locations, limiting the interpretation of the findings. A recent, uncontrolled study reported the outcomes of clotted grafts undergoing thrombectomy, as well as stent placement at the venous anastomosis [50]. In this more homogeneous group of grafts, the primary graft patency was 63% at 6 months. Although there was no matched control group treated with angioplasty alone, the unassisted graft survival was far superior to that reported in several series (11 to 34% at 6 months)[10, 57_61] RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Methods: Angioplasty Arm: These patients will undergo the standard of care protocol: mechanical thrombectomy plus angioplasty of the stenosis at the venous anastomosis. Procedures: A_V grafts are more prone to recurrent stenosis and thrombosis than are fistulas, and require multiple radiologic or surgical interventions to ensure their long_term patency for dialysis [26]. A report from UAB observed that the first salvage procedure to maintain graft patency (thrombectomy, angioplasty, or surgic l revision) was required in 29% of grafts at 3 months, 52% at 6 months, 77% at 12 months, and 96% at 24 months [5]. Most grafts required multiple interventions over time to maintain their patency for dialysis. A mean of 1.22 interventions were required to maintain access patency per graft_year, including 0.51 thrombectomies, 0.54 angioplasties, and 0.17 surgical revisions. Secondary graft survival (time from initial placement to permanent failure, regardless of number of interventions) has ranged from 59 to 87% at one year, and 50 to 73% at two years [27_35]. A number of studies have examined the association of demographic and clinical factors with long_term graft survival, but no consistent clinical predictor of poor graft outcome has emerged. Windus et al [27] observed lower graft survival in diabetics as compared with nondiabetics. In contrast, three other studies observed no significant difference in graft survival between diabetic and nondiabetic patients [5, 35, 36]. Several investigators have reported a lack of association between patient age or sex and long_term graft survival [5, 35_37]. Windus et al [27] found that older age predicted lower graft survival in non_diabetics, but not in diabetic patients. Graft survival is similar between upper arm and forearm grafts [5, 29]. Finally, hypoalbuminemia has been associated with shorter A_V graft survival in 2 reports [5, 36]. The major cause of graft failure is thrombosis due to underlying stenosis of the venous anastomosis, draining vein, or central vein [10, 38]. When the stenosis is not detected and corrected in a timely fashion, grafts typically thrombose. Clotted grafts require thrombectomy by either Radiology or Surgery, most commonly in association with correction of the underlying stenosis. If graft patency cannot be restored, it becomes necessary to construct a vascular access at a new anastomotic site. Intervention_free graft patency is considerably lower following thrombectomy than after elective angioplasty [10]. A comparison of graft outcomes after radiologic interventions at our institution found that the primary (unassisted) patency was only 30% at 3 months for clotted grafts, as compared with 71% for patent grafts undergoing elective angioplasty [10]. Not surprisingly, graft survival was worse if there was a residual stenosis after the angioplasty. However, even in the subset of patients with no residual stenosis after the intervention, the primary 3_month patency was still lower in clotted grafts, as compared with patent grafts undergoing elective angioplasty (median survival, 2.5 vs 6.9 months). Design: This will be an open_label, prospective, randomized clinical trial comparing the outcomes of thrombosed AV grafts treated with mechanical thrombectomy and angioplasty (current standard of care), as compared with stent deployment after mechanical thrombectomy and angioplasty. Subjects: The subjects for this study will be recruited from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Nephrology practice. UAB provides medical care for approximately 500 hemodialysis patients, under the supervision of 12 full_time nephrologists. We average 150 graft thrombectomy procedures annually at our institution. All patients will receive 3000 to 4000 units of heparin during the procedure. All patient receive conscious sedation with Fentanyl and Versed, unless allergic to either one Because graft patency is much worse following thrombectomy than after elective angioplasty, the current state of clinical access management involves an ongoing surveillance program to monitor for evidence of hemodynamically significant graft stenosis, and referral of such patients for elective angioplasty or surgical revision. The rationale for this approach is that correction of graft stenosis in a timely fashion will decrease the risk of graft thrombosis and prolong the survival of the graft [19]. Substantial clinical research has been directed at evaluating the predictive values of several noninvasive screening tests to identify hemodynamically significant graft ste osis, so that the patients can be referred for angioplasty or surgical revision before the graft has a chance to clot. These surveillance methods have included: dynamic dialysis venous pressures, static dialysis venous pressures, recirculation, Doppler ultrasound, ultrasound dilution methodology, and access blood flow (Reviewed in [39]). Graft stenosis can also be predicted by aggressive clinical monitoring (looking for decreases in Kt/V, prolonged bleeding at graft needle sites, and abnormalities of graft inspection and auscultation [1, 40]. A number of observational studies have reported substantial (50_60%) reductions in the frequency of graft thrombosis using a variety of surveillance methods [40_43]; none have eliminated this problem. Four randomized studies evaluating the efficacy of access surveillance on graft outcomes have found that surveillance is an excellent tool for identifying hemodynamically significant graft stenosis. However, the higher frequency of preemptive angioplasty in the surveillance group did not appear to translate into a reduction in graft thrombosis or prolongation of graft survival [44_47]. This discrepancy suggests that preemptive angioplasty may not be effective in producing sustained improvement of the stenotic lesion. Stent deployment may improve the durability of graft angioplasty and decrease the variability between operators in graft patency following radiologic interventions. Thus, it is possible that more frequent use of stents might enhance the value of graft surveillance. Screening: After obtaining informed consent, the clinic chart will be reviewed for inclusion and exclusion criteria. The subject will undergo a screening evaluation including a history and physical prior to the intervention. Randomization: All subjects with a recent thrombosed AV graft who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria and consent to participation in the study will be randomized to either the angioplasty arm or the angioplasty plus stent deployment arm. Patients will be taken to the interventional suite in the Interventional Radiology department. Randomization will occur only after ascertaining that that graft flow has been restored and that there is a >50% stenosis at the venous anastomosis. Randomization will be accomplished by unsealing a sequentially numbered opaque envelope that contains the randomization allocation for that subject. Stent Deployment Arm: These patients will undergo the same protocol as the angioplasty arm but at the end a covered stent (wallgraft) will be deployed at the stenotic lesion of the venous anastomosis. Graft stenosis occurs as a consequence of aggressive myointimal hyperplasia, which occurs most commonly at the venous anastomosis [48]. Vascular injury resulting from the angioplasty may actually accelerate the process of myointimal hyperplasia, thereby resulting in early re_stenosis [49]. Endoluminal stents, by forming a rigid scaffold at the venous anastomosis, may slow the encroachment of the area of myointimal hyperplasia into the vascular lumen, thereby limiting the magnitude of recurrent stenosis. Thus, use of stents may be of utility in preventing restenosis following angioplasty. Stent placement has been attempted for treatment of grafts in which angioplasty results in suboptimal technical success or if the stenosis recurs rapidly. A number of small series have reported the outcomes of stent placement for vascular access with refractory stenosis [50_56]. Unfortunately, these studies have suffered from several methodologic limitations, including retrospective data collection, absence of a suitable control group, combining patent and thrombosed grafts, combining stents placed at a variety of stenotic sites, and combining grafts with fistulas. Angioplasty Arm: All patients diagnosed with a thrombosed graft will undergo mechanical thrombectomy within 48 hours of diagnosis in conjunction with angioplasty of the underlying stenotic lesion. The grafts are initially accessed with a single needle at the arterial limb of the graft. A glide wire is passed up to he central vessels and the needle exchanged for a 6_French catheter sheath. Mechanical thrombectomy is achieved with a Trerotola device. A second 6_French sheath is placed in the venous limb of the graft, and a glide wire passed into the arterial circulation. A Fogarty balloon is passed through the wire beyond the arterial anastomosis and pulled back to dislodge the clot. An anterograde and retrograde angiogram of the graft is performed to assess patency and to look and grade the stenotic lesions. Lesions at the venous anastomosis with at least 50% stenosis are considered hemodynamically significant. An angioplasty balloon is placed and inflated at the level of the stenotic site. Stent Arm: The procedure will be identical to that followed in the angioplasty arm. However, after the stenotic lesion has been angioplastied, the appropriate Bard Fluency_cPTFE Encapsulated Nitinol Stent will be deployed. In both randomized groups, a final angiogram of the graft will be performed, and the residual stenosis at the site of the angioplasty quantified. In addition, intra_graft and systemic blood pressures will be measured upon completion of the intervention. These pressures will be measured directly through a disposable pressure transducer. The ratio of graft to systemic systolic pressure will be calculated. This ratio has been previously shown to be predictive of subsequent primary graft patency [1, 10]. Subsequent Intervention for Either Arm: Subsequent graft interventions will be determined by the clinical judgment of the patient's nephrologists, independently of the study intervention. Such intervention may include mechanical thrombectomy with angioplasty if the graft re_thromboses; referral for diagnostic fistulogram with possible angioplasty if there is clinical suspicion o graft stenosis; surgical revision if the graft has a stenosis that is not amenable to radiologic intervention; and placement of a dialysis catheter if graft patency cannot be restored. All these events will be tracked prospectively. Completeness of information about subsequent access interventions will be optimized by a cross_check with the Division of Nephrology prospective, computerized, access database maintained by our Access Coordinators [40]. Endpoints. The primary end point will be the primary patency of the graft (time from the initial thrombectomy to the next graft intervention (angioplasty, thrombectomy, or surgical revision). The secondary end points are: 1. Secondary patency, (time from thrombectomy to permanent graft failure, regardless of number of subsequent salvage procedures) 2. Total cost of access procedures and access complications per year of followup. Follow_up Period: Subjects will be followed for a period of 2 years from the date of randomization. Prospective data will be collected on (1) all subsequent access procedures (angioplasty, thrombectomy, surgical revision, or placement of dialysis catheter), (2) all access_related hospitalizations (those due to an access complication or non_access related hospitalizations in which an access procedure is performed), and (3) all access_related complications, e.g., catheter_related bacteremia or metastatic infections. Statistical Analysis: Sample size: Power calculations were performed by the statistician (Jill Barker, Ph.D.) on the basis of our preliminary data from the outcome of thrombosed grafts at UAB. The estimated sample of 130 patients, evenly divided between the two groups, was sufficient to detect a tripling in median graft survival from 1 month on the control arm to 3 months on the stent arm, assuming an exponential distribution, 3 years of accrual, 1 year of followup, two_sided significance level of 0.05, and power of 0.80. Analysis: The statistical analysis will be done in collaboration with Jill Barker, Ph.D. (Consultant). Baseline patient characteristics between the 2 groups will be compared by unpaired Student t_tests or Chi_square analysis, as appropriate. Statistical analysis will be performed on an intent_to_treat basis. Primary and secondar graft survivals curves will be generated by the Kaplan_Meier method. The differences in graft survival between groups will compared by log rank test. In addition, the association between baseline clinical characteristics and graft survival will be analyzed by univariate and multi_variable regression analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model. The costs of all subsequent access_related procedures, hospitalizations, and complications will be determined using Medicare reimbursement rates in Alabama. The total cost of access care between groups will be compared by unpaired Student t_tests."
Nct	Impact of GBS on CVD in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	2008		CN-02021519	"Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are more likely to die from cardiovascular diseases (CVD) than people without diabetes. Furthermore, Patients with diabetes have not benefited from the advances in the management of CVD and/or its risk factors that have resulted in a decrease in mortality for CVD patients without diabetes. Short_term studies have demonstrated that weight loss in over weight or obese subjects with T2DM is associated with decreased insulin resistance, substantial improvements in glycemic and lipoprotein profile, and reduction in blood pressure. However, Long_term data substantiating that these improvements can be maintained are limited. Obesity, and susceptibility to weight gain, is a chronic condition. Continuous care is required to avoid weight regain especially after intensive weigh loss. Morbidly obese patients with body mass index (BMI) over 35 kg/m2 have significant difficulties maintaining weight loss adequate to resolve obesity_related medical conditions by changes in lifestyle or pharmacologic strategies. Currently, surgical treatment of morbid obesity, termed bariatric surgery, appears to be the only modality that results in significant and sustained weight loss along with reversal of diabetes and improvements in cholesterol biosynthesis, and lipoprotein metabolism in morbidly obese patients. Given these observations, we question if patients with T2DM who undergo gastric bypass surgery will significantly reduce levels of abnormalities in vascular structure and function that are central to the development of atherosclerosis. In specific aim 1, we will determine whether surgically induced weight loss decreases the risk of CVD in morbidly obese subjects with T2DM. . In specific aim 2, we will elucidate the mechanisms by which surgically induced weight loss reduces over time the risk of CVD in morbidly obsess subjects with T2DM. The proposed study is a prospective cohort clinic trial aimed to evaluate changes over time in cardiovascular structure and function of morbidly obese subjects with T2DM undergoing gastric bypass surgery compared to a matched control group who do not undergo gastric bypass surgery. The results of the proposed study will provide the foundation for a new clinic strategy aimed to prevent the development of CVD in obese patients with T2DM. Furthermore, it will serve as the baseline for future large scale longitudinal studies based on aggregate occurrence of severe cardiovascular events."
Nct	Comparison of the I-gel Laryngeal Mask and the Classic Laryngeal Mask in Patients With a BMI>25	2009		CN-01526514	"Inclusion criteria of this randomized cross_over study are: BMI > 25, elective surgery in supine position, age>18 years, ASA I_II; Exclusion criteria are: difficult airway, pregnancy, history of reflux or gastrointestinal disorders, abdominal or thoracic surgery; In this cross_over trial both airway devices are inserted in the same patient, the order of insertion is randomized. Patient receive monitoring with blood pressure, ECG and pulse oxymetry during operation. Anaesthesia is induced intravenously using fentanyl (0.001 mg/kg) and propofol (3_5 mg/kg). The I_gel laryngeal mask is inserted with a gastric tube. The classic laryngeal mask was cuffed after insertion with a cuff pressure of 60 cmH2O. The first device is removed 5 minutes after insertion and replaced by the second device. Ease of insertion is graded as very easy=1, easy=2, difficult=3 and very difficult=4. Leak pressure is measured by two tests: In the first test the spill valve is closed at a fresh gas flow of 6l/min and the minimum airway pressure at which gas leaked around the airway device is recorded by listening for an audible leak. In the second test leakage is measured during pressure controlled ventilation. Therefore we administer a fresh gas flow of 3l/min, FiO2 of 50%, inspiration to expiration ratio of 1:2 and a frequency of breathing of 12. Leakage can be measured by the respirator. We record inspiration pressure, mean pressure, plateau pressure, tidal volume and peep at which the first measurable leakage occurred. For statistical analysis we will use t_tests with a power of 80% and a p < 0.05."
Nct	Muscadine Grape Seed Supplementation and Vascular Function	2009		CN-01526718	"Study Participants Participants were adult male and non_pregnant female outpatients ages 18_65 with one or more of the following cardiovascular risk factors: hypertension (blood pressure ³ 140/90 or current treatment for hypertension); dyslipidemia (total cholesterol > 220 mg/dL + LDL cholesterol > 130 mg/dL, or current use of lipid_lowering medications); or controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (glycated hemoglobin < 8.0 % with or without medication). Subjects with a history of coronary artery disease (any history of myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization) were also eligible for participation. Subjects were excluded if they had a history of congestive heart failure (any classification), unstable angina or acute coronary syndrome within the last 30 days, uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure ³ 170/100 mm/Hg), type 1 diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (HbA1C ³ 8.0%), history of gastrointestinal disease or surgery affecting absorption, peripheral arterial disease, diagnosis of active cancer (excluding squamous cell or basal cell skin cancer), current use of long_acting nitrate compounds such as isosorbide dinitrate or nitroglycerin, recent change in any medications (last 30 days), active plan to change diet or exercise patterns, history of hypersensitivity to any compound in the intervention or placebo, or history of intolerance to nitrates. Study Design The study was a double_blind, randomized crossover design to evaluate the effects of muscadine grape seed supplementation (Nature's Pearl 650 mg, two capsules daily.) The phytochemical profile of the supplement is presented in Table 1. The trial consisted of a screening visit followed by baseline and closeout visits for two study treatment periods (4 weeks each), separated by a 4_week washout period (total of 5 visits over 14 weeks).Endothelial function was assessed at the beginning and end of each study period using brachial artery flow_mediated dilation (brachial FMD _ described below). A fasting blood sample was obtained at the open and close of each study period for measurement of lipids, inflammatory markers, and markers of antioxidant capacity and oxidative stress. Participants were asked to abstain from red wine, antioxidant vitamin supplements (including vitamin E, vitamin C, and beta_carotene supplements, more than 1 cup of black or green tea daily, and other grape seed supplements. Multivitamin supplements were permitted as long as they were taken for the study duration. Endothelial Function Study Protocol Details for the brachial FMD protocol, automated analysis and reproducibility have been published previously {Herrington 2001}. Briefly, subjects rested in a quiet, temperature_controlled room for 15 minutes. A standard (pediatric) cuff was placed on the right forearm 2 inches (5 cm) below the antecubital fossa. Once the transducer position was established over the left brachial artery, continuous scanning of the brachial artery was obtained for 2 minutes before the cuff occlusion, 4 minutes of cuff occlusion, and 2 minutes immediately after cuff release. Data were analyzed with an automated analysis system that determines changes in brachial artery diameter for 2 minutes after cuff release. Statistical Analysis The effects of supplementation with muscadine grape seeds and placebo were compared using paired t_tests and mixed linear models to take into account treatment order and period effects. The mixed linear models were also used to formally test for a residual effect of treatment in those subjects receiving active treatment in the first treatment period. Stratified analyses were performed to look for evidence of differential effects by age, gender, prevalent heart disease or heart disease risk factors. Nominal 2_tailed p_values are presented for the primary outcome (percent change in brachial diameter) and for all secondary outcomes. All analyses were performed using SAS v. 9.1 (Cary, NC)."
Nct	Gabapentin for Prophylaxis Intrathecal Morphine-Induced Pruritus	2010		CN-01501757	"The study was approved by the ethic committee of Songklanagarind Hospital in Songkhla, Thailand, and was designed as a randomized, double_blind, placebo_controlled trial. All patients gave their informed consent after receiving written information of the study. Orthopedic patients were invited to participated between September 2009 and August 2010. Patients were considered eligible if they were aged between 15_70 yr, ASA physical status I_III, and were scheduled for lower limb surgery under spinal anesthesia. Patients were excluded if they presented of any following reasons: contraindication for spinal anesthesia, known allergy history to gabapentin, complaint of pruritus before surgery, morbid obesity (BMI > 35), coexisting skin disorder, and any systemic disease associated with pruritus. Patients who had history of seizure attacks, mental illness, chronic headache, or neuropathic pain and were concomitantly using of anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antipsychotics, or antihistamine were also excluded. Patients were randomized into the treatment and the placebo groups according to a computer_generated randomization list and patients were allocated consecutively. The blinding was maintained by keeping the treatment code with one of the investigators, separating them from the investigator performing the assessments. Patients in the gabapentin group received two capsules of gabapentin 300 mg (Neurontin¨, Pfizer) at 2 h before operation. The patients in the placebo group received equal numbers of identical looking placebo, according to the same schedule. In order to prepare the identical looking medications, for gabapentin group we coated gabapentin capsules by other capsules and for placebo group we filled the identical looking capsules with flour. All patients did not receive any other sedative agents beside the study drugs. After standard monitoring (electrocardiogram, noninvasive arterial blood pressure, and pulse oximetry) was set_up in the operating room, each patient was received Ringer's lactate or normal saline solution 5_10 mL/kg, spinal anesthesia was performed at the L2_3 or L3_4 interspace with a 27_gauge Quincke_type needle using 0.5% isobaric bupivacaine plus 0.2 mg of preservative_free morphine. Midazolam, morphine, fentanyl and propofol were administered intravenously (IV) for intraoperative sedation at the discretion of the anesthesiologist. We excluded the patient who failed spinal block, inadequate block, and the patient who had prolong operative time which had to continue with general anesthesia because we could not evaluate pruritus. The sedation level was evaluated by the Ramsay Sedation Scale during the operation. The patients were followed for 24 h after intrathecal administration of morphine. Postoperative wound pain was assessed with a verbal numeric rating scale (VNRS). Rescue treatments for postoperative pain were provided with any medications ordered by anesthesiologists or orthopedists. Pruritus was evaluated at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 24 h after intrathecal administration of morphine by a blinded investigator. The patients were questioned about the presence and degree of pruritus. The degree of pruritus was classified as 0 = absent, 1 = mild (restricted to one area such as face or arms, not troubling the patient, often reported only after prompting), 2 = moderate (affecting a larger area such as face and arms or face and anterior surface of thorax, not disturbing the patient, therefore not requiring treatment), or 3 = severe (extensive or generalized, often disturbing the patient to the point of necessitating treatment). Severe pruritus was treated with 10 mg IV chlopheniramine. Patients were also evaluated the severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) which graded on a four point scale as 0 = no nausea or vomiting, 1 = mild nausea only, 2 = nausea or vomiting responding to initial treatment, and 3 = nausea or vomiting requiring repeat treatment, the presence of urinary retention and the other side effects of drug treatment. Patients who reported v miting received 4 mg IV ondansetron or 10 mg IV metoclopramide. The primary outcome measure of the study was the incidence of pruritus during the 24 h follow_up period. The difference of onset time and severity of pruritus in the gabapentin and placebo groups served as the secondary outcome measure. Additional secondary outcome measures were side effects of the gabapentin group. There was an intention_to_treat in our study. Statistical analysis was performed using the R 2.11.1 software. We considered a 35% reduction in the incidence of pruritus to be clinically important according to the previous study's result showed that gabapentin 1200 mg could reduce incidence of intrathecal morphine_induce pruritus by 38%12. In our study we reduced the dose of gabapentin to 600 mg as describe previously so we think the efficacy of the drug may decrease so we assumed that gabapentin 600 mg could reduced incidence of intrathecal morphine_induced pruritus by 35%. Power analysis was performed to determine the sample size with a probability for a type II error of 0.2 and type I error of 0.05. To detect a 35% reduction in the incidence of pruritus, using the incidence of pruritus in Songklanagarind Hospital which was 63%, a sample size of 80 patients in each group was estimated to be required. To accommodate for 10% patient dropouts and failure of spinal anesthesia, 88 patients were enrolled in each group. Incidence of pruritus was measured by using Chi_Square test. The onset time and severity of pruritus was analyzed by means of Kaplan_Meier probability curves. Continuous data were analyzed using un_paired student T_test for normal distribution data such as BMI and by Mann_Whitney U test for non normal distribution data such as age, operative time, postoperative verbal numeric rating pain score. Comparison of the categorical data was performed using chi_square test such as incidence of PONV, hypotension, and shivering and by Fisher's exact test if expected value < 5 such as type of operation, incidence of bradycardia, and ASA classification. Results are expressed as mean+SD for normal distribution data and median (range) for non normal distribution. For all determinations, P values of < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant."
Nct	"Apnea, Bariatric Surgery Versus Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) Trial"	2010		CN-01531161	"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is one of the most common complications of obesity, resulting in excessive sleepiness and daytime functional impairment as well as acting synergistically with obesity in predisposing to hypertension, insulin resistance, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and stroke. The current first line treatment for moderate to severe OSA, nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is extremely effective but is often not well tolerated, leading to low adherence rates in many patients. Bariatric surgery has been approved as treatment for OSA in patients with co_morbid obesity and in small studies, appears to produce substantial improvements. However, no trials directly comparing bariatric procedures with standard CPAP treatment yet exist to guide clinicians and patients in choosing the most appropriate first line treatment. This trial will address the feasibility and safety, and estimate the effect sizes for a subsequent Phase 3 trial. We will recruit 80 patients with severe OSA and morbid obesity (body mass index, BMI, of 35_45 kg/m2) from two large clinical sleep programs that together care for a wide spectrum and demographically diverse group of OSA patients. After establishing patient and physician equipoise, subjects will be randomized to a trial of CPAP or laparoscopic gastric banding as first line treatment for OSA. The primary outcome measures will be improvement in OSA severity under both ideal and real life conditions (i.e., in the CPAP arm, while using CPAP in a controlled environment vs. while using prescribed therapy in the usual home environment, respectively), which will allow for assessments of both comparative efficacy and effectiveness. Outcomes will be assessed at 9 months to quantify the early effectiveness of each treatment strategy as well as to demonstrate clinical equipoise in conducting a future larger long term trial using these two arms. Further follow_up will occur at 18 months in a subset of 40 patients to determine effect sizes for the subsequent study at a point where the bariatric arm has neared a plateau in weight. Secondary outcomes will include patient_related outcomes including sleepiness, quality of life, and an index of health service utilization. In addition, changes in biomarkers related to inflammation, insulin resistance, lipids, blood pressure, and arterial stiffness will be assessed in each group, and in relationship to changes in BMI and OSA, to identify promising outcome measures for future trials. Incurred costs will be collected in all subjects in order to establish the parameters needed for a cost effectiveness analysis. This pilot study will represent the first controlled comparison of medical and surgical treatments for OSA and in addition, will provide the necessary data to develop the optimal study design for a subsequent long term multi_center comparative effectiveness study to better understand the potential role that bariatric surgery may offer in the management of OSA."

Nct	The ACT-OUT Trial: aCTivity OUTcomes Based on High Carbohydrate or High Fat Diet in Metabolic Syndrome	2011		CN-01486601	"1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE: Current obesity prevention emphasizes increasing physical activity and a low_fat, calorie restricted diet to produce a negative caloric balance. Caloric restriction is associated with decreases in energy expenditure. The other mainstay of obesity prevention increasing levels of physical activity is associated with greater caloric intake. Failure of the eat less_exercise more strategy is evident with epidemic of obesity, metabolic syndrome (MetS) and type II diabetes. Moreover, the displacement of dietary fat in the diet has led to compensatory increases in carbohydrate intake that is associated with untoward metabolic effects. Carbohydrate restricted diets are controversial despite benefits of this approach. The controversy stems from a compensatory increase in dietary fat intake associated with carbohydrate restriction and fears that greater fat intake increases risk of cardiovascular disease. Carbohydrate restriction decreases insulin resistance and ameliorates MetS. This protocol aims to establish a greater evidence base for carbohydrate restricted diets as a therapeutic option for MetS. The investigators will review current knowledge with respect to: (i) obesity and insulin resistance in Canada, (ii) positions of major medical organizations (iii) shortcomings of the current obesity prevention paradigm (iv) why carbohydrate restricted diets work. 1.1) Obesity and insulin resistance in Canada In the 1980s low fat, caloric restricted diets became the cornerstone of dietary advice to reduce obesity. This approach successfully reduced the percent of calories from fat with a consequential increase in carbohydrate consumption. In the ensuing years, obesity become epidemic. In Canada, the prevalence of obesity (BMI ³ 30 kg/m2) increased from 10% in 1970s to 23% in 2004 with an additional 36% considered overweight (BMI 25_29.9). As obesity is a risk factor for MetS and type II diabetes, the prevalence of these disorders has also reached epidemic proportions. Approximately 2 million Canadians were living with diabetes in 2007 and by 2012 it is estimated that 2.8 million Canadians will be living with diabetes. First Nations communities have been especially hard hit, with a prevalence 3_4 times higher and a younger age of onset than non_First Nations individuals. Novel chronic disease prevention strategies are needed to address this crisis. Insulin resistance underpins the pathophysiology of obesity, Insulin resistance is a condition in which normal amounts of insulin are inadequate to produce a normal insulin response from fat, muscle and liver cells. As a result, insulin resistant individuals have both elevated blood glucose, fasting insulin and secrete greater amounts of insulin in response to dietary carbohydrate. This compensatory hyperinsulinemia is associated with adverse effects in tissues which retain their sensitivity to insulin. Elevated blood glucose levels are associated with advanced glycation end products, reactive oxygen species and low grade inflammation. These exposures are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease & diabetes. Despite the evidence associating elevated insulin levels to atherogenic changes in the vasculature, it remains a matter of controversy as to whether persistently elevated insulin levels are pathogenic. The diagnosis of MetS represents an entry_point for disease prevention efforts in individuals with diabetes and cardiovascular disease. MetS is defined as a high waist circumference in addition to two of the following: high triglycerides, low HDL and elevated blood pressure. Other pathophysiologic changes are also observed including low grade inflammation, increased uric acid, prothrombotic state, elevated ApoB, small dense atherogenic LDL and endothelial dysfunction. First line treatment for MetS is weight loss leading to reductions in insulin resistance. Intensive lifestyle interventions reduce diabetes in high risk subjects. Most lifestyle interventions for MetS are predicated on the hypothesis that individuals can initiate and maintain weight loss by restricting calories and increasing physical activity. The Diabetes Prevention Program showed that intensive intervention including a low_fat calorie reduced diet and increase in physical activity was associated 1.5 kg/m2 decrease in BMI and a 58% reduction in incidence of diabetes in individuals at high risk of diabetes. Less intensive interventions are associated with more modest changes. A study of nutritional counselling was associated with a 0.4 kg/m2 decrease in BMI. Thus, lifestyle interventions which emphasize 'eating less or exercising more have limited value. The optimal diet for subjects with MetS has not been examined with hard end_points. Small trials have compared carbohydrate restricted diets and low fat diets using surrogate markers. A trial of severely obese subjects found greater weight loss and greater improvements in lipid levels and hemoglobin A1c on carbohydrate restricted diet than low fat/calorie restricted diets. In a study of adults with MetS, those randomized to the carbohydrate restriction had greater weight loss, lower triglycerides and lower insulin levels than individuals on a calorie restricted, low fat diet. These results are consistent with a meta_analysis where carbohydrate restricted diets were associated with improvements in atherogenic dyslipidemia, greater weight loss and better compliance than low fat, calorie restricted diets. These studies highlight the advantages of carbohydrate restriction. 1.2) Fat, sugar and positions of major medical organizations One of the principal barriers to the widespread implementation of carbohydrate restricted diets is the fear that increase in saturated fat consumption with its association with increase in LDL_chol, will result in greater risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This diet_heart hypothesis has formed the cornerstone of dietary advice for prevention of chronic disease. The avoidance of saturated fat has led to general avoidance of dietary fat. There is weak and contradictory evidence that both saturated fat and dietary fat restriction are associated with health benefits. The largest test of the diet_heart hypothesis was the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). This study randomized women to either a low saturated fat diet or a regular diet. After 8 years, women randomized to the low fat diet had lower LDL_chol but no decrease in CVD mortality, incidence of breast or colorectal cancer. Consistent with the results of the WHI, a meta_analysis which included 347,747 subjects found no relationship between saturated fat intake and CVD. While most experts would agree that it's too early to vindicate saturated fat as the foremost dietary evil, evidence is accumulating highlighting the obesigenic and atherogenic nature of refined carbohydrates. A trial aiming to decrease sweetened beverage consumption found the intervention group had 7.7% less overweight and obese children than controls. In NHANES (2006), consumption of added sugar was associated with higher triglycerides and lower HDL. A prospective study of Dutch adults found that replacing 5% of calories from saturated fat with high glycemic carbohydrates was associated with a 33% increase in risk of myocardial infarction. The current state of scientific confusion over the health effects of (refined) carbohydrates is reflected in the diversity of dietary recommendations. American Diabetes Association (ADA) dietary guidelines have suggested that carbohydrate restricted diets are an option for weight loss for up to 1 year. In contrast, Canadian Diabetes Association recommends a diet with 45%_60% of calories from carbohydrate with a sucrose intake up to 10% of daily intake. The contradictory nature of these positions highlights the need for more research into the health effects of carbohydrate restricted diets. The endorsement of carbohydrate restriction by ADA suggests that these diets are valid therapeutic options. 1.3) Shortcomings of the traditional obesity prevention paradigm The current obesity prevention paradigm emphasizes caloric reduction and/o increased physical activity to produce negative caloric balance. While physical activity has established benefits, increasing physical activity as a weight loss strategy has met with disappointing results. Observational studies associating high levels of physical activity with lower adiposity are difficult to interpret as individuals with higher physical activity also benefit from other (unmeasured) health promoting behaviours. In randomized trials, physical activity interventions have shown equivocal results with respect to weight loss. The physiologic limitation of this approach is that it is difficult to augment physical activity without a compensatory increase in dietary intake. In studies where physical activity is directly supervised and in the absence of a compensatory increase in caloric intake, physical activity has been associated with weight loss < 3% of initial body weight. In physical activity interventions of lower intensity, results are less promising. A meta_analysis of school based physical activity interventions in youth found no effect on BMI. The ineffectiveness of physical activity as a means of weight loss is reflected in the American Heart Association and American College of Sports of Sports Medicine position statements where they recommend 60_90 minutes of moderate intensity activity/day to lose or maintain weight loss. Not surprisingly, there is a very low prevalence of individuals who are moderately active for 60_90 minutes/day in the general population. Ironically, insulin resistant individuals who would reap the greatest health benefits from physical activity may have a reduced physiologic tolerance for it as insulin resistance has been associated with reduced exercise tolerance through reversible changes in muscle mitochondria, reduced VO2 max and possibly other mechanisms. The failure of low fat, calorie restricted diets to curb the prevalence of obesity is exemplified by the WHI. After 7.5 years of follow_up, the women randomized to the low fat group decreased their weight by 0.8 kg but had a 1 cm increase in waist circumference despite a reported decrease in caloric intake of 360 calories. Weight loss in the low fat group was not different than women in the control group, who were consuming a typical American diet. Calorie restricted diets emphasize the avoidance of energy dense foods high in dietary fat. While avoidance of dietary fat has intuitive appeal, calorie restriction is associated with a corresponding decrease in energy expenditure, in effect, stimulating a starvation response. The compensatory decrease in energy expenditure is associated with a plateauing of weight loss, an increased desire to eat and weight gain. Low fat/high carbohydrate diets require weight loss to produce positive metabolic effects. This dependence on weight loss for health benefits combined with the inevitable rebound weight gain associated with this dietary strategy has the potential to worsen metabolic markers over the long term. The untoward metabolic changes associated with a high carbohydrate intake are particularly deleterious in individuals with MetS. This contrasts with the physiologic effects of carbohydrate withdrawal in insulin resistant subjects that mirrors reversal of MetS. In addition to improvements of MetS, carbohydrate restricted diets are associated with less dense and therefore less atherogenic LDL particles and decreases in inflammatory markers. A final limitation of the current obesity prevention paradigm is that macronutrients (fat, protein and carbohydrates) are assumed to have equivalent metabolic effects. The investigators will review metabolic effects of macronutrients relating to the insulin response and energy balance. Carbohydrates are potent secretagogues of insulin that is the primary regulator of adipose tissue metabolism and partitions dietary energy into either storage (higher insulin) or oxidation (lower insulin). Mice genetically engineered to lack the insulin receptor on fat cells consume more calories per gram of body weight but are resistant to obesity. In ty e II diabetics, administrations of exogenous insulin or drugs which stimulate insulin release from the pancreas are associated with weight gain. Dietary fat has no effect on insulin secretion but delays gastric emptying. Dietary protein lowers the glucose response to insulin 2_3 times more effectively than dietary fat and plays an important role in appetite suppression and potentially weight regulation. The addition of dietary fat, protein and fiber to dampen the untoward effects of dietary carbohydrate in a meal is the concept behind the glycemic index. Low glycemic index diet may be of less relevance to type II diabetics, however, as the effect of dietary fat and protein in blunting glucose responses is attenuated or absent. If obesity prevention is indeed evidence base then there are only two tools left in the public health arsenal, bariatric surgery or carbohydrate restriction. 1.4) Why do carbohydrate restricted diets work? There are at least two physiologic characteristics of carbohydrate restricted diets which contribute to weight loss. First, ad lib carbohydrate restricted diets have been associated with spontaneous reductions in caloric intake. Second, these diets are associated with greater weight loss per calorie than low_fat diets with an unexplained caloric deficit of about 200 kcal/day. The preferential weight loss of carbohydrate restricted diets was termed 'the metabolic advantage'. The concept of a metabolic advantage associated with carbohydrate restricted diets has been controversial among experts. While there is evidence supporting its existence in animal models and in humans, this phenomena remains poorly understood. Ad lib carbohydrate restricted diets are often associated with spontaneous decreases in caloric intake. This is caused by the insulin lowering effects of carbohydrate restricted diets as high insulin levels have been associated with partitioning of metabolic fuels into adipose tissue and greater food intake. A trial of obese subjects found that those consuming a carbohydrate restricted diet had nearly a 30% decrease in fasting insulin levels and a 570 kcal decrease in energy intake. Thus lower insulin levels are a key mediator between lower carbohydrate consumption and weight loss. A study in men found that 70% of the variability in weight loss from a carbohydrate restricted diet was explained by changes in fasting insulin. A number of trials have shown a metabolic advantage of carbohydrate restricted diets compared to low fat diets. There are three possible explanations. First, there might be greater energetic costs associated with metabolic interconversions of nutrients on carbohydrate restricted diets. Second, individuals on a lower carbohydrate diet may have higher energy expenditure due to a greater resting metabolic rate and/or greater levels of physical activity. A final possibility is that lower weight loss is due to the selective under_reporting of dietary intake in individuals randomized to low fat diets. This latter explanation is not likely as this finding has been observed in numerous randomized controlled trials. Diet induced thermogenesis may have a small contribution to the metabolic advantage of carbohydrate restricted diets. It accounts for 5_15% of total energy expenditure. The energetic costs to metabolize macronutrients vary from 2.5% with dietary fat, 7_15% with carbohydrate and 28_35% with protein. One study found that energy expenditure was 4% higher in a diet containing 30% compared to 10% of calories from protein. Thus the modest increase in energy expenditure due to a higher protein intake would not likely be enough to account for the metabolic advantage of carbohydrate restricted diets. Physical activity is the greatest modifiable source of energy expenditure. The hypothesis that the metabolic advantage of carbohydrate restricted diets could explain lower insulin levels associated with spontaneous increases in physical activity has received scant attention. This hypothesis is based on a number of well established observations. First, type II diabet cs taking exogenous insulin have decreases in energy expenditure and weight gain. When insulin levels are lowered through carbohydrate restriction or pharmacotherapy there is an attendant loss of fat mass and some evidence for a modest increase in energy expenditure. A short study of obese individuals found that a ketogenic, low carbohydrate diet with a 30% decrease in insulin resistance was associated with a 20% increase in resting energy_expenditure, though physical activity was not assessed in this study. Similarly, in a 6 month randomized trial of obese women, those on the carbohydrate restricted diet had a non_significant 5% increase in resting energy expenditure per kg of body weight compared to baseline. This study also assessed physical activity using pedometers and found no difference in steps/day between the carbohydrate restricted group and the low_fat group despite a 3.7kg greater weight loss in the former and no difference in reported caloric intake between groups. Measurement of physical activity in free_living individuals is complex. Pedometers are an objective assessment of physical activity but are unable to assess intensity, frequency and duration of activity. They are also unsuitable for estimation of energy expenditure. In summary, intensive lifestyle interventions reduce the incidence of type II diabetes in individuals with metabolic syndrome. Central to the therapeutic effect of these interventions is weight loss. There is a lack of consensus over what constitutes 'best practices' for lifestyle interventions. Physical activity is associated with numerous health benefits but is not an efficacious prescription for weight loss or weight maintenance. Moreover, the optimal dietary prescription is controversial; some experts suggest individuals with MetS should restrict their dietary fat intake while other experts suggest dietary carbohydrate should be restricted. This controversy in dietary prescription is reflected in the positions of major medical organizations. The American Diabetes Association has endorsed carbohydrate restriction for weight loss since 2008. The Canadian Diabetes Association, however, favours lower glycemic index foods and the restriction of dietary fat. Despite the equivocal evidence, a low fat, calorie restricted diet coupled with increased physical activity are considered the standard lifestyle interventions for MetS. 2. OBJECTIVES This protocol has three aims. First, the investigators hypothesize that adherence to a lower carbohydrate diet in individuals with MetS, resulting in lower insulin resistance; will cause an increase in levels of spontaneous physical activity, independent of changes in weight. Second, the investigators will examine changes in cardiometabolic risk factors (ApoB, TG, HDL, blood pressure, CRP) when individuals are randomized to either a carbohydrate restricted diet or a low fat/high carbohydrate diet. Finally, the investigators will interview a sub_sample of participants from both study arms (5 in each arm) to conduct open_ended interviews to better understand quality of life issues with respect to the dietary assignment or lifestyle intervention. 3. RESEARCH PLAN Our group has generated cross_sectional data showing a clinically meaningful association between higher carbohydrate intake and lower physical activity, assessed by accelerometer in glucose intolerant individuals. The limitation of these findings relate to the inability to assess causality; that is, if carbohydrate restriction causes increases in physical activity. The strength of the ACTout study is its ability to delineate causal direction using a prospective design and randomization to control for known and unknown confounders. Study design and participants: Study participants will be randomized to an ad lib carbohydrate restricted group or a low fat, calorie reduced diet for 6 months. The investigators will recruit individuals with metabolic syndrome (MetS) from St. Paul's Metabolic Syndrome Program. Inclusion criteria include a diagnosis of MetS defined as an increased waist cir umference and two or more of the following: fasting blood sugar greater than 5.6 mmol/L, fasting triglycerides greater than 1.7 mmol/L, high density lipoprotein (HDL) less than 1.0 mmol/L in men and less than 1.3 mmol/L in women and blood pressure greater than 135/85 or on antihypertensive medication. Potential participants will be excluded if they are following a weight reducing diet, are abusing alcohol or other psychoactive substances, are on psychiatric medication associated with weight gain or have plans to travel during the study period. Randomization: The investigators will use block randomization to prevent the biasing of the randomization process. After each block of subjects is enrolled, the investigators will use a computerized randomization program to randomly assign participants to one of the two dietary assignments. Due to the difficulty in concealing the dietary assignment, the randomized trial will not be blinded; as both researchers and participants will be aware of their dietary assignment. To minimize the contamination of study groups, individual and group sessions will be scheduled at different times. Control group: The control group will be randomized to the intensive lifestyle intervention currently used by the Healthy Heart Program at St. Paul's Hospital to reduce symptoms associated with metabolic syndrome. Participants will be instructed to replace high fat, energy dense foods with foods rich in whole grains, fruits and vegetables. The macronutrient distribution of this diet will be approximately 55% carbohydrate, 15% protein and 30% fat. Individuals will also be instructed to reduce sodium intake to <2300 mg/day and in individuals with hypertension, <1500 mg/day. At the end of the study, participants will have the option to continue on either of the study diets. Measurement of body composition and estimation of resting energy expenditure: Sample size calculation: To calculate sample size the investigators used cross_sectional data with accelerometer measured physical activity and excellent quantitative measures of diet. The investigators assumed a 15% difference in calories consumed as carbohydrates between the dietary treatments. With a significance value of p < 0.05 (two sided test) the investigators found that 27 participants would be required in each group to detect a significant difference in accelerometer measured intensity of activity. To account for possible attrition the investigators will overestimate the sample size by 10 in each arm. The investigators will recruit 72 individuals with 36 in each arm. Based on our sample size calculation, the investigators expect to detect time and diet based differences in addition to a diet*time interaction. Recruitment strategy: The investigators will recruit individuals with metabolic syndrome from the Metabolic Syndrome Program. Flyers will be posted in the waiting room and the examination rooms of the Program. Flyers will also be given to the administrative assistants responsible for intake of participants into the Program who may choose to notify participants of the study. If a potential participant expresses interest the coordinator will explain the study in sufficient detail to enable informed consent. To assess diet prior to inclusion into the study the investigators will ask potential participants to complete a 3 day diet history and wear the accelerometer for 7 days to ensure that they are not already following a weight reducing diet and to assess baseline physical activity. Individuals compliant with both the dietary recall and baseline assessment of physical activity will be randomized into one of the two dietary assignments. Carbohydrate restricted diet: Participants will be instructed to restrict carbohydrate consumption to < 20 grams/day while not restricting their caloric intake. Participants will be encouraged to consume vegetables with low carbohydrate content every day including 2 cups of salad greens and 1 cup of vegetables 'that grow above the ground'. One of the physiologic changes associated with a low carbohydrate intake is loss of salt through the urine. If salt is not replaced participants may experience headaches, nausea, dizziness, lethargy and constipation. Participants will be counselled to increase their salt intake. This has been shown to correct the natiuresis associated with carbohydrate restriction which can cause the aforementioned side effects. Participants will be advised to continue their baseline level of physical activity. Methods to ensure compliance to the dietary assignment: The study coordinator will facilitate activities to support compliance to the dietary assignment, either one_on_one or in a group setting. Group meetings will reinforce compliance by sharing cooking tips, behaviour modification and relapse prevention strategies. In the one_on_one sessions, the study coordinator will review 3 day food records and discuss strategies to increase compliance. Participants from both groups will meet with their clinician after 3 months to assess health indicators and to assure participants of the safety of their dietary assignment. Qualitative interviews: The investigators will conduct hour long open_ended interviews with 8_10 participants from the study to understand the lived experience of a prudent diet and a carbohydrate restricted diet. Interviews will be recorded and transcribed. The investigators will use grounded theory to look for theories which emerge from the data as opposed to having interpreting the data with an a priori analysis. The investigators will then assign descriptive categories to themes which emerge from the data, such themes could include: effect of their diet on diabetes, perceptions of hunger, mood etc. These descriptive categories will then be placed into thematic categories and analyzed in light of the existing of the literature. The investigators will use bioelectrical impedance to assess body composition at baseline and at 6 months. Bioelectrical impedance has been shown to provide a reasonable assessment of body composition compared to DXA, which is considered a gold standard. The investigators will normalize fat mass and fat_free mass to height by using a fat_mass index and a fat_free mass index (kg/m2), respectively. Height will be measured with a stadiometer at baseline. Waist circumference will be assessed at baseline and at 6 months, after exhalation, using a flexible tape measure half way between the hip bone and the lowest rib. The investigators will estimate energy expenditure using previously published equations which take into account fat_free mass, fat mass, gender and age. Questionnaire: The investigators will use the Applied Health Indicators Questionnaire and the Patient Health Questionnaire, to collect relevant health information from the patient. These self_administered questionnaires will be completed at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Physical activity assessment: Participants will wear an accelerometer to assess physical activity at baseline and week of every month for 6 months. An accelerometer is a small electronic monitor worn on the waist that measures vertical accelerations and is thus considered an objective measure of physical activity. Patients will be instructed to wear the accelerometer during waking hours for 1 week of every month, exclusive of time spent bathing or when in water. Data will be downloaded in one_minute epochs and categorized as light, moderate or vigorous activity. Days will be excluded when the accelerometer is worn for less than 80% of the average time worn on the other days. The investigators will estimate activity_based energy expenditure using previously validated equations. As accelerometers do not capture activity associated with cycling, swimming or skiing the investigators will ask participants about the number of times they did these activities in the period that they wore the accelerometer. Cardiometabolic indices: Blood samples will be drawn and placed in individually labelled tubes with EDTA, centrifuged immediately and stored at _70¡C. As changes in insulin action are central to our hypothesis the investigator will assess two distinct aspects of insulin metabolism in this study, insulin secretion and insulin resistance. The investigators will assess insulin resistance using HOMA assessment of insulin resistance calculated from fasting insulin and fasting glucose. The investigators will assess the concentration of C_peptide, a cleavage product related to insulin synthesis that is synthesized in equimolar concentrations to insulin. As C_peptide has a longer half_life than insulin, it can be used a marker of insulin secretion from the pancreas. Blood Pressure will be assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months using BP_TRU monitors. Lipid, lipoprotein and C_reactive protein levels will be measured at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Total cholesterol, triglyceride, high_density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B will be measured using previously described methods. LDL_chol levels will be calculated using the Friedewald formula for patients whose plasma triglyceride level is less than 4 mmol/L. __hydroxybutyrate will also be assessed in both groups at the aforementioned time points and will be used as a biomarker of adherence to a carbohydrate restricted diet. The investigators will also assess serum Leptin and uric acid at baseline and 6 months. Statistical analyses: The investigators will use two different approaches to analyze the data. First the investigators will use an intention to treat analysis using baseline values to impute missing data in participants who may drop_out of the study. The investigators will also examine the effect of the dietary assignment on outcomes in participants who were compliant with their dietary assignment. Baseline characteristics will be compared between the two groups using t tests. The investigators will examine three inter_related dependent variables, capturing different aspects of physical activity, in the analysis strategy. First, the investigators will examine the association between dietary assignment and changes in accelerometer variables. The investigators will also examine time spent in moderate_to_vigorous physical activity and activity based energy expenditure. As activity based energy will be estimated from accelerometer , the investigators will not consider it a unique comparison. The investigators will thus set the level of statistical significance at p<0.025 to adjust for multiple comparisons. The investigators will obtain differences in key variables such as physical activity and change in insulin concentration. To assess the effects of the dietary assignment on physical activity, the investigators will use three_way repeated_measures ANOVA, including change in body weight in the model with time as the repeated factor."
Nct	Effects of Noradrenaline Administration Combined With Restrictive Intraoperative Fluid Substitution on Perioperative Outcome in Patients Undergoing Radical Cystectomy	2011		CN-02021142	"Background Perioperative fluid management in abdominal surgery is a subject of controversy and current standard fluid therapy is not evidence based. Standard fluid therapy includes replacement of basic fluid requirements, loss by perspiration, by exsudation through the surgical wound, and loss into the third space. In animal experiments on pigs, high (18ml/kg/h) or low (3ml/kg/h) volume crystalloid fluid treatment had no effect on colon tissue oxygenation tension. Three different fluid volume regimens (3ml/kg/h, 7 ml/kg/h and 20ml/kg/h) tested did not affect tissue oxygen pressure in the jejunum and colon, suggesting efficient autoregulation of intestinal blood flow in healthy pigs undergoing uncomplicated abdominal surgery 25. Noradrenaline increased systemic blood flow (mean arterial pressure and cardiac index) and failed to increase microcirculatory blood flow in most abdominal organs in septic pigs. Thoracic epidural anesthesia per se does not affect intravascular volume. Therefore, vasopressors are preferable for treatment of hypotension after epidural anesthesia. The incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction varies greatly with reported rates of 10% to 55%. Patient characteristics such as age, education, type and length of surgical procedure and preoperative cognitive status have been found to affect the incidence and severity of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. The influence of intraoperative volume management on cognitive function has not been assessed. It seems of interest and safe to use a noradrenaline perfusor combined with a low volume regimen during open radical cystectomy. The low volume regimen, as described in this study protocol, is well established in our institution, which has a large experience in cystectomy. Objective The aim of this study is to compare intraoperative blood loss, quality of the surgical field (defined later), metabolic response, pain relief, fatigue score, gastrointestinal function, cardiovascular, pulmonary, infectious and surgical complications and cognitive function in two groups of patients undergoing radical cystectomy. The first group will be treated according to an internationally accepted standard fluid regimen (6 ml/kg/h of crystalloids and correction of the hypotony with fluid boluses); the second one will be treated with a restrictive fluid regimen of 2ml/kg/h of crystalloids in combination with sympathicomimetics. Methods Prospective, randomised, controlled, single_centre study. Randomly assigned in equal proportion by computer to receive the dry regimen 2ml/kg/h combined with sympathicomimetics or the standard fluid management. An advanced balanced electrolyte solution will be used containing acetate/malate instead of lactate. Substantial advantages are a base excess of +/_ O mmol/l, that it is isotonic, and contains anions acetate and malate. 208 patients with open radical cystectomy Duration: 36 months Setting: University Department of Urology , Inselspital Bern, Switzerland Study sample and power calculation A power analysis for postoperative complication rate as primary outcome has been done with the NCSS PASS programme: Power: 80% Significance: 0.05% or lower Complication rate for the restrictive volume regimen group: 20% Complication rate for the control group: 38% 83 patients will be required in each group. Assuming a 20% drop_out rate 104 patients per group will be enrolled. Fluid preload before spinal or just after epidural anaesthesia is a common and recognized practice in clinical anaesthesia. Vasodilatation is a well_known side effect of halogenics, of most hypnotics and opiates. Compensating decreasing blood pressure by volume substitution is common praxis. Alternatively the fall in blood pressure due to vasodilatation can be corrected by applying vasoactive agents. A review of the data on the effect of ""high volume"" perioperative fluid therapy suggests that overhydration may have deleterious effects on cardiopulmonary function (excessive shift to the right on the Starling myocardial performance curve, pneumonia and respiratory fai ure) as well as on recovery of gastrointestinal motility (prolonged postoperative ileus (PI)), tissue oxygenation and wound healing (anastomosis leakage). A postoperative weight gain of 3_7 kg in patients after major elective surgery therefore seems to represent a genuine fluid overload. Delay in bowel motility may be due to the presence of excess fluid in the intestinal wall resulting from excess perioperative fluid therapy. Increased gut permeability after surgical trauma may also contribute to the development of PI because of enhanced uptake of luminal bacterial products. Postoperative complications were significantly reduced by restricted fluid therapy. A dose response relation between administrated fluid volume and postoperative complications (cardiopulmonary and tissue healing) was found in a randomised assessor blinded multicenter trial for colorectal surgery 11,12. The restricted fluid regimen did not lead to haemodynamic instability and the amount of vasoactive substances administered was similar. No significant difference in urinary output was demonstrated on days 1 and 6. Restrictive fluid administration in fast_track surgery led to no differences in all_over recovery after colonic surgery. Goal_directed intraoperative fluid administration using the oesophageal Doppler monitor to maintain maximal stroke volume has been shown to reduce the length of hospital stay, lower the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting and to encourage an early return of bowel function. Oesophageal Doppler monitor permits rapid, minimally invasive and continuous estimation of cardiac output. It can be easily inserted and is not associated with major complications. The investigators will use oesophageal Doppler monitoring for intraoperative monitoring of stroke volume and cardiac output."
Nct	Multimodal Analgesic Using Morphine and COX-2 With or Without Dexmedetomidine for Colorectal Surgery	2011		CN-01486485	"PROCEDURES: Patients will be approached at the pre_admission clinic or in the general ward before operation. The analgesic modalities will be explained and patient will be recruited into study if s/he agrees. Patient will then be randomised into one of the two groups receiving intraoperative morphine with dexmedetomidine then postoperative PCA morphine (D), or intraoperative morphine only then postoperative PCA morphine (M). Randomisation, blinding, and preparation of dexmedetomidine and placebo Patients who undergo open and laparoscopic colonic and rectal surgery will be stratified in randomisation. For each type of operation (colonic and rectal), randomisation will be based on using blocks of 5 patients to ensure both groups having equal sample size. A computer_generated random sequence will be used to select the allocation order. Both patients and investigators will be blinded to the allocated analgesic modalities, i.e. the administration of dexmedetomidine. Dexmedetomidine or normal saline (placebo) will be prepared by clinical staff who will not participate in observation and data analysis. For group D, dexmedetomidine will be prepared by adding 2ml of the drug (100_g/ml) to 48ml of 0.9% sodium chloride injection, which make up to a total of 50ml. The final concentration for administration is thus 200_g in 50ml, i.e. 4_g/ml. For group M, a syringe of 50ml normal saline will be prepared as placebo. As both dexmedetomidine and placebo will look the same as 50ml clear liquid in syringe, both patient and investigator will be blinded to the substance administered. Preoperative care: The patients will be assessed at pre_admission clinic or at the general ward. Blood for soluble CD40L with other routine investigations will be taken. Bowel preparation will start one day before operation. Patient will fast since midnight before operation. Anaesthesia and intraoperative care: Both groups of patients will be anaesthetised according to the protocol as follow: Patient will receive no sedative premedication. On arrival in the operation theatre, a 16_gauge intravenous cannula will be placed under local analgesic. Pulse, pulse oximetry and non_invasive blood pressure measurement will be checked every 5 minutes throughout the operation. Propofol 2mg/kg, fentanyl 1.5_g/kg and atracurium 0.5mg/kg will be used for general anaesthesia induction. Anaesthesia will be maintained with mixture of isoflurane, air and oxygen. Isoflurane concentration will be titrated to optimal heart rate and blood pressure by the anaesthesiologist. Thermal blanket and infusion fluid warmer will be used to aim at maintaining core body temperature at 35.5 to 37.5 degrees Celsius. A urinary catheter will be inserted to monitor urine output. Intermittent pneumatic compression device will be applied to the lower limbs for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. At the discretion of the anaesthesiologist, hypotension will be treated with intravenous ephedrine or phenylephrine. Hypertension or tachycardia will be treated with isoflurane up to 2% end_tidal concentration ( 1.5 MAC). If persisted, beta_blockers such as labetalol or arterial vasodilators such as hydralazine may be given. Analgesic modalities and pain assessment: Procedures for the two analgesic modalities are described below: From postoperative day 0, rescue analgesic in the form of intramuscular pethidine 0.5mg/kg will be prescribed every 4 hours if necessary. After PCA morphine has stopped, NRS pain scores at rest and during cough, dose and frequency of rescue analgesia used will be charted once a day until discharge. Postoperative care and assessment: Early mobilisation is encouraged after operation. On postoperative day 1, patient will be put on fluid diet. Isoflurane will be switched off after closure of the inner layer of the wounds. Reversal will be achieved by intravenous neostigmine 50_g/kg and atropine 20_g/kg after operation. Patient will then be transferred to recovery room for monitoring for at least 1 hour. Group D: intraoperative morphine with dexmedetomidine then pos operative PCA morphine. Patient will receive a loading dose of 1_g/kg (0.25ml/kg) intravenous dex_medetomidine over 10 minutes before induction, and then followed by continuous infusion at a rate of 0.5_g/kg/h (0.125ml/kg/h) until wound closure. Bolus dose of 0.1mg/kg morphine sulphate will be given intravenously prior to incision. At the third and forth hour, morphine sulphate 0.1mg/kg may be given in divided dose titrated to patient's response. On arrival in the recovery room, boluses of 2mg intravenous morphine will be given every 5 minutes until NRS pain score is less than 4. A PCA machine will then be connected. The machine will be configured to give 1mg of morphine at a time and the lockout duration will be set to 5 minutes. No basal infusion will be given and the maximum dose limit will be 0.1mg/kg per hour. Group M: intraoperative morphine then postoperative PCA morphine. All procedures for Group D patients will be followed, but dexmedetomidine administration will be replaced by placebo (normal saline) of the same volume and rate. Both groups: Starting from postoperative day 1, when patient resumes fluid diet, oral celecoxib 200mg will be given twice daily for 3 days or until discharge, whichever earlier. From day 4 onwards, one tablet of dologesic (paracetamol plus dextropropoxyphene) will be given every 4 hours as needed until discharge. During the administration of PCA morphine, respiratory rate, SpO2 and sedation score will be monitored every hour; blood pressure and pulse, numerical rating scale (NRS) pain scores at rest and during cough, cumulative doses and tries/goods, as well as side effects will be recorded every 4 hours. Patient will be seen by anaesthesiologist every day to assess the adequacy of analgesia. PCA morphine will be administered for at least 2 days. On postoperative day 2, if NRS pain scores during cough is less than 4 on a clinically low morphine consumption, PCA will be stopped; if equals or greater than 4, or still on a high PCA consumption, it will be continued. Assessment will be repeated daily. If NRS pain score during cough remains at 4 or above on day 5, patient will be evaluated for complications and managed at the discretion of the anaesthesiologist. The surgical team will be responsible for postoperative assessments, such as recording daily gastrointestinal function (bowel sound, flatus and bowel opening), postoperative complications (if any) and readiness for discharging patient (good pain control with oral analgesics, ambulatory, resumption of bowel function, i.e. stool or flatus, have 2 to 3 feeds without vomiting or abdominal distension). Blood for soluble CD40L and other routine investigations will be taken at post_operative day 2. Patient's satisfaction on analgesia will be asked using NRS from zero to 10 upon discharge. DATA COLLECTION: The following data will be collected: _ Demographics _ Time of admission _ Type of colorectal surgery and incision _ Intraoperative vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, pulse oximetry) _ Estimated intraoperative blood loss _ Volume of intraoperative fluid/blood infusion _ Duration of anaesthetic/analgesic procedures before surgical procedures _ Duration of surgical procedures _ Time from end of surgical procedures to extubation _ Tries and goods of PCA use _ Cumulative morphine consumption _ NRS pain scores at rest and during cough and vital signs upon recovery, hourly for 4 hours, then 4_hourly during PCA morphine up to 5 days, and daily afterwards until discharge _ Dose and frequency of rescues analgesic (IM pethidine) use _ Side effects of analgesics, if any (pruritis, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, etc.) _ Time to recovery of bowel functions (bowel sound, flatus and bowel opening) _ Time to recovery of food intake (fluid, semisolid and solid diet) _ Time to ambulation (bed rest, sit up, sit out of bed, walk with aid, walk without aid) _ Surgical and anaesthetic complications, if any (ileus, perineal abscess, wound infection, urinary retention, etc.) _ Time to discharge _ Patient's satisfacti n upon discharge _ Persistent pain 6 months after operation _ Survival status 6 and 12 months after operation _ Soluble CD40L preoperatively and at post_operative day 2 If, at certain time point after operation, patient is unable to be managed according to protocol due to any reason such as development of complication, no further data will be collected. DATA ANALYSIS: The intention_to_treat principle will be used. In other words, patient will be included and remained in their designated groups for data analysis even if there is a change in surgical or anaesthetic/analgesic management, as long as they have had an open or laparoscopic abdominal incision during operation. Statistical methods used: _ Intraoperative vital signs, estimated blood loss, duration of anaesthetic/analgesic and surgical procedures, time to extubation, tries and goods of PCA use, cumulative morphine consumption, dose and frequency of rescue analgesic use, time to recovery of bowel functions, food intake and ambulation, time to discharge: Student's t_test _ NRS pain scores, patient's satisfaction: Mann_Whitney U test _ Side effects and postoperative complications: binary logistic regression"
Nct	Goal Directed Therapy for Patients Undergoing Major Vascular Surgery	2011		CN-02023527	"The management and delivery of intravenous fluids during surgical operations is one of the important duties for anesthesiologists. There is a growing body of evidence that fluid overload in surgical patients is associated with decreased wound healing, slower return of gut function, anastomotic breakdown, pulmonary edema and post_operative visual changes. In the United States, abdominal aortic aneurysms are diagnosed in 190,000 people per year, and over 50,000 of those have the aneurysm repaired5. Recent advances in endovascular techniques have allowed many of these patients to forego an open repair. However, because of technical difficulties, many patients still require an open repair. The most common cause of morbidity in these patients is related to post_operative gastrointestinal tract dysfunction. This usually involves an adynamic ileus that the patients develop on the fourth post_operative day. This delays their tolerance of enteral foods and lengthens their hospital stay and hospital costs. It also has the potential of causing more morbidity in that patients may require total parenteral nutrition while awaiting return of bowel function. There are several causes of this gastrointestinal morbidity including direct mechanical trauma to the bowel during surgery and activation of the inflammatory cascade. These factors are unfortunately not modifiable by the team caring for the patient. One factor that is modifiable is the amount and type of intravenous fluids administered to the patient. Typically, anesthesiologists decide on the amount of fluid to administer to patients based on parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure and urine output. These are unfortunately unreliable in determining a patient's volume status, as these parameters can be within the normal range, and a patient might still have inadequate perfusion to their vital organs. Further, clinician's reliance on blood pressure as a target for fluid administration ignores the fact that organs require blood flow as well as pressure to function optimally. Until recently, the only way to measure blood flow was with the insertion of a pulmonary artery catheter. Based on several studies showing a lack of benefit of this invasive procedure, it has fallen out of favor in the non_cardiac arena. Newer monitors of cardiac output that can be attached to a patients arterial catheter (commonly placed for major surgical procedures) offer an alternative method for clinicians to measure cardiac output. All of these studies have in common the use of a minimally invasive CO monitor and a reliance on colloids as the predominant fluid utilized during the case. The utilization of SVV to determine volume status is a novel approach to fluid management in surgical patients. As stated above, clinicians' historical reliance on pressures (such as as blood pressure and central venous pressure) to estimate intravascular volume status is based on an incomplete understanding on the factors that govern organ blood flow. To this end, the investigators will also assess several parameters during this study in an attempt to ascertain which is the best at predicting fluid responsiveness. Fluid responsiveness is defined as the ability to predict if a given patient will increase their CO to a fluid bolus. To date this has not been looked at in a systematic fashion. One of these monitors, the FloTrac system (Edwards Life Sciences, Irvine CA), utilizes the arterial pulse contour to calculate cardiac output (CO) and the stroke volume variation (SVV) as a monitor of volume status. In patients who are mechanically ventilated there is a phasic variation in CO and stroke volume based on the ventilatory cycle. Large changes in stroke volume during the ventilatory cycle may indicate hypovolemia in patients. The administration of intravenous fluid to these patients results in a decrease in the SVV. Thus, the SVV can be use a volume monitor and used to titrate intravenous therapy. There have been several trials (mostly in colonic resection surgery) that have looked at such goal directed ther py with this and similar devices and have found a decrease in patient morbidity and length of stay. There is also evidence to suggest that such goal directed therapy reduces the degree of inflammation that invariably occurs after operations of this magnitude. It is hypothesized that by resuscitating the endothelium more effectively with intravenous fluids that remain in the intravascular space longer, there is less endothelial damage and thus less inflammation."
Nct	Bariatric Surgery and Reactive Hypoglycemia	2012		CN-02034793	"INTRODUCTION Geltrude Mingrone,Simona Panunzi, Andrea De Gaetano, Caterina Guidone, Celestino Pio Lombardi, Marco Raffaelli,Rocco Bellantone Departments of Internal Medicine, Surgery and Biomathematics of the Catholic University of Rome, Italy The overall prevalence of grade 2 and 3 adult obesity (BMI> 35 kg/m2) derived from the 2009_2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) exceeded 15% and grade 3 obesity (BMI > 40 kg/m2) accounted for 6.3% (1). The dietary approach is modestly satisfactory in the short term and weight regain is practically the rule in the long run as a consequence of the scarce compliance to the diet shown by the obese subjects. In fact, in a recent study (2) where different types of diets were assigned to a population of overweight and obese subjects (BMI from 25 to 40 kg/m2), an average of 6 kg, corresponding to 7% of the initial body weight, was lost in the first 6 months, but the weight was regained after 1 year and at 2 years, only 31_37% of the participants had lost 5% of their initial weight. Bariatric surgery has long been recognized as an effective treatment for grade 3 or grade 2 obesity associated with complications (3) and, accordingly, the number of bariatric operations in the United States is growing over time from ca. 10,000 in the early 1990s to 103,000 in 2003 (4). Bariatric surgery allows to type 2 diabetes remission (5,6) while improving several other serious comorbidities (7). Among the bariatric surgical procedures, roux_en_y gastric bypass (RYGB) was shown to account for 41% of all bariatric operations at least in the United Sates (8). Sleeve gastrectomy (SG), that was conceived as the first step before performing a RYGB or a biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch in patients who were super_obese (9), has recently emerged as a new restrictive bariatric procedure (10). It was noticed that SG determines a weight loss similar to that achieved after RYGB (11) and larger than that following laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (12,13). Reactive hypoglycemia is a late complication of RYGB although it seems to occur also after SG. After RYGB insulin secretion is enhanced early after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (14) or a meal (15,16) and might explain the later reactive hypoglycemia. An increasing number of reports highlight the occurrence of severe hypoglycemia after RYGB including neuroglycopenia that is attributed to nesidioblastosis (17_20). Roslin et al (21) found that 72%, i.e. 26 out of 36 patients operated of RYGB 6 months earlier, had reactive hypoglycemia at 2 hours after an OGTT (100 g of glucose), which was defined as ""an absolute serum glucose level ²60 mg/dL, or a drop of 100 mg/dL in serum glucose level in 1 h"". As compared with RYGB, SG seems to have a much lower occurrence of reactive hypoglycemia, ca. 3%, i.e. 1 out of 31 patients studied at 6 weeks after the operation (22). Fortunately, the frequency of severe hypoglycemia or related symptoms requiring hospitalization after RYGB is pretty low, the adjusted hazard ratios were in fact 2.7 for hypoglycemia, 2.8 for confusion, 4.9 for syncope, 3.0 for epilepsy and 7.3 for seizures (23) in a Swedish cohort study based on national registries with 5,040 operated persons (23). The primary aim of the present study is to conduct a 1_year randomized trial to compare the incidence of hypoglycemia after RYGB or SG. STUDY OBJECTIVE Secondary objectives EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Study End_points Primary End_point The Primary Endpoint of the study is the incidence reactive hypoglycemia at 1 year after the bariatric surgery. Secondary End_points _ Changes at 1 year of insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion measured after an OGTT. _ Changes at 1 year of body weight, BMI, abdominal circumference, body composition, lipid profile and cardiovascular system abnormalities. However, until now no prospective studies have investigated the incidence of hypoglycemia after RYGB nor randomized studies have been undertaken to compare the effect of SG to that of RYGB in terms of i cidence of hypoglycemic episodes. Primary objective The primary objective of the study is to verify whether SG decrease the percentage of patients presenting with reactive hypoglycemia with respect to RYGB within 1 years after the bariatric operation. _ To quantify the relative contribution of changes in insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion measured after an OGTT to the glycemic effect of bariatric surgery and to determine if differences exist between the two surgical treatments. _ To determine whether treatment is associated with body weight, BMI and abdominal circumference loss and with body composition, as assessed by DEXA, as well as with lipid profile and cardiovascular system abnormalities. _ To assess the occurrence of severe hypoglycemia or related symptoms (shakiness, sweating, dizziness or light_headedness, confusion, difficulty speaking, weakness, confusion, syncope, epilepsy, seizures) within 5 years after the operation and determine whether SG decrease its incidence. _ the incidence of severe hypoglycemia or related symptoms (shakiness, sweating, dizziness or light_headedness, confusion, difficulty speaking, weakness, confusion, syncope, epilepsy, seizures) within 5 years after the operation. Experimental plan This is a monocentric prospective controlled randomized clinical trial designed to investigate if the SG reduces the incidence of reactive hypoglycemia with respect to RYGB within 1 years after the bariatric operation. At the moment of the Screening visit subjects will be randomized to be undergone either the SG or the RYGB surgical procedure. Study Design diagram The diagram of the study plan is as follows: Screening Visit (_18 weeks) Baseline Visit (_4 weeks) Follow_up Visit (+1 month) Follow_up Visit (+3 months) Follow_up Visit (+6 months) Follow_up Visit (+9 months) Follow_up Visit (+12 months) Written informed consent Demographic Data Medical and surgical history Physical examination  Height weight, BMI waist and hip circumference DEXA blood pressure and heart rate ECG laboratory assessments OGTT adverse events recording concomitant medication An overview of all planned blood samples, including volumes and purpose is provided in Table 2. Study duration Subjects will be studied from the time of Screening Visit to 1 year after the surgical procedure and will undergo four distinct phases: _ Screening visit (week _18) _ Baseline visit (week _4) _ A follow_up period after the surgical treatment (1 year of duration, month 1, 3, 6, 9, 12) _ A further follow_up period after study conclusion (4 years of duration) Screening Visit At week _18, eligible patients are identified and the Written informed consent is obtained. Demographic data, anthropometric measures, physical examination and information about medical history, concomitant medication and variables related to inclusion criteria are collected. Basal Visit At week _4 patients at the screening visit will be asked to return for the baseline visit and they will be asked to give their informed consent to randomization. Study compliance will be assessed during the screening and baseline periods using attendance at appointments and completion of questionnaires. Baseline anthropometric measures, body composition, blood pressure, and biochemical data (levels of fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], C_peptide, and serum insulin, lipid profile and oral glucose tolerance test) are measured. _ Safety reasons as judged by principal investigator Follow_up Period One month after the bariatric surgery and each 3 months until 1 year after the surgical treatment (month 1, 3, 6, 9, 12) all the collected variables at baseline will be recorded and an OGTT will be performed. Adverse events will be recorded at each follow_up visit. Study conclusion and a further follow_up period At the conclusion of the a study a conclusion form will be filled in and patients will be followed up to 5 years after the surgical treatment. STUDY POPULATION Sample size The sample size depends on the magnitude of the d fference in reactive hypoglycemia incidence as derived from previous studies (21) and (22). The study is designed to detect a more conservative absolute difference in the occurrence of hypoglycemia of 50%, expecting an incidence of 70% in the RYGB group versus an incidence of 20% in the SG group. A sample size of 19 patients per group would be required for this clinical trial to detect an improvement data significance level of 0.05 and a power of 0.90. Considering an attrition rate of 25% over the course of the study a total of 50 subjects (25 for each group) will be enrolled. An amendment to enlarge the number of patients to 120, 60 in each arm, was approved by the Ethical Committee on November 2012. For a more conservative estimate in fact, we have reduced the percent difference between the two groups from 50% to 30% considering the incidence of reactive hypoglycemia to be 50% in RYGB and to 20% in SG instead of 70% and 20% respectively. In this way, the number of patients to be allocated in each arm is 50 with a power of 90%. Considering an attrition rate of 20% the number of patients in each group will be 60 and, thus, overall 120. Secondary endpoints for CGM and insulin sensitivity and secretion are evaluated in a subset of 50 patients, 25 in each Group, but can be also extended to entire sample. Selection study population Patients will be recruited from the Outpatient Clinics and Day Hospital of Obesity of the Catholic University of Rome, Italy. The study will be subject to revision and approval by the Ethical Committee of the above institution in accordance with the guidelines of the National Health Ministry and the Helsinki Declaration, as revised in 2000. All participants will provide written informed consent to participate in the study. Additional written informed consent will be obtained prior to the surgical procedure. Inclusion Criteria Patients are eligible if aged between 25 and 65 years, have a body mass index of 35 (in presence of complications as sleep apnea, severe coxarthritis or gonarthritis, severe hypertension) to 50 kg/m2, and are able to understand and comply with the study process. Exclusion Criteria _ History of type 1 diabetes or secondary diabetes; _ Previous bariatric surgery; _ History of medical problems such as mental impairment; _ Major cardiovascular disease; _ Major gastrointestinal disease; _ Major respiratory disease; _ Hormonal disorders; _ Infection; _ History of drug addiction and/or alcohol abuse; _ Internal malignancy; _ Pregnancy; _ Impaired glucose tolerance; _ Suspected or confirmed poor compliance; _ Informed consents; Participants will be excluded if they did not attend at least 2 initial information visits. TREATMENT Surgical Program Within 1 month of randomization the patients will undergo RYGB or SG. An entero_entero anastomosis, with a Roux_en_Y type of reconstruction, allows the bile and pancreatic juices to mix with the nutrients at about 100_150 cm from the gastro_jejunal connection. Criteria for discontinuation and/or withdrawal Criteria for discontinuation: _ Withdrawal of informed consent _ Subject uncooperative Roux_en_Y Gastric Bypass This laparoscopic operation includes the division of the stomach in two parts. A proximal, smaller pouch (20_25 cc volume), is connected to the rest of the gastrointestinal tract through a gastro_jejunal anastomosis, whereas the distal gastric pouch is left behind but excluded from the transit of food. Sleeve gastrectomy Laparoscopic SG involves a longitudinal resection of the stomach on the greater curvature from the antrum starting opposite of the nerve of Latarjet up to the angle of His The final gastric volume is about 100 mL. Randomization Process Automatic dynamic allocation of the treatment to the patients will be performed via a Web_based software. The randomization procedure via Internet is an automatic and flexible mechanism that on one hand guarantees random allocation and on the other hand reduces imbalance with respect to the two treatment groups over the two consider d stratification factors: gender and age (18_40 and 40_60). The mechanism may be accessed from any web_connected computer; it clears the user for data access (userid/password); it requires the user to specify the screening number of the subject about to be randomized; it verifies inclusion/exclusion criteria and acquires stratification information; it finally assigns the subject to a treatment, and delivers the corresponding unique randomization number. The procedure optimizes the overall balance of treatments among each stratification cell. The allocation algorithm will be verified by the responsible statistician for the study, who will have continuing access to the randomization statistics throughout the duration of the study. _ Non_compliance to the protocol _ Incorrect enrolment _ Subjects who could not be operated laparoscopically _ Conditions requiring medication that could interfere with the outcome of the study except those for intercurrent illnesses or adjustment of anti_hypertensive therapy as judged by the principal investigator _ Subjects with severe complications due to the surgery as judged by the principal investigator _ Bleedings related to surgery that make it impossible to draw blood samples Subjects may be discontinued from the study at any time, at the discretion of the investigator. Subjects are free to discontinue their participation in the study at any time. Subjects who discontinue from the study should always be asked about the reason(s) for the discontinuation. If possible, they should always be seen and assessed by an investigator. Adverse events will be followed up according to national requirements. If a subject discontinues participation in the study, then his enrolment number cannot be issued to another subject. EFFICACY EVALUATION In order to evaluate the effect of the sleeve gastrectomy versus the Roux_en_Y Gastric bypass on the glycemic control the following parameters will be considered: Primary endpoint Primary Endpoint: incidence of reactive hypoglycemia at 1 year after the bariatric surgery.

Concomitant medication (week _18, week _4, month 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12) SAFETY AND TOLERANCE EVALUATION AND ASSESSMENT The safety of the surgical procedures will be evaluated at the end of the study analyzing all the information recorded in the Case Report Form suitably designed for the study, according to the timing and modalities described in other sections of the present protocol. Information to assess the safety will include: objective exam, patient's symptoms related to the operation, occurrence of adverse events. Safety parameters Adverse Events The clinical tolerability will be evaluated by recording of the occurrence of adverse events as reported by the patient or observed by the medical investigator. Any adverse event occurred after the surgical treatment will have to be recorded in the Case Report Form. Definitions An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject undergone a treatment and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, or related to the surgical procedure. Pre_existing events, which increase in frequency or severity, or change in nature during or as a consequence of use of a drug in human clinical trials, will also be considered as AEs. A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any adverse event regardless of causality that led to a death, led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that resulted in a life_threatening illness or injury, resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, required in_patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment to body structure or a body function. led to fatal distress or fatal death. A serious adverse device effect (ADE) is a serious adverse event related to the adopted device (in the specific case the surgical procedures) that results in any of the consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event or that might led to any of these consequences if suitable action is not taken or intervention is not made or if circumstances are less opportune. Adverse Event and adverse device effect Reporting Procedures If the investigator identifies the occurrence of an AE, SAE or of an ADE report form must be completed and sent by fax to the Coordinating Investigator within 24 hours of the investigator's knowledge of the event. This form will be part of the study documentation. Any fatal or life_threatening event should be reported immediately to Coordinating Investigator by telephone. These preliminary reports will be followed within 24 hours by detailed descriptions that will include a completed SAE/ADE form, copies of hospital case reports, autopsy reports, and other documents, when requested and applicable. Minimal information should include: An identifiable subject or patient The type of surgical treatment the patient was undergone An identifiable reporting source All related adverse events All medications used Follow_up of SAE/ADEs that occur during the study will continue until satisfactory resolution or stabilization, with a maximum of s x months, upon judgment of the investigator. The coordinating investigator may request that certain adverse events to be followed until resolution. If/ when supplementary information is available, a follow_up SAE/ADE Report Form must be completed by the investigator and delivered within 24 hours to the coordinating investigator. Once faxed, the SAE/ADE form and accompanying documentation should be placed in the SAE/ADE section of the investigator's file. If supplementary information on a SAE/ADE has to be sent, the SAE/ADE form has to be used marked as ""follow_up report"". The coordinating investigator must inform the Ethics Committee if the serious adverse event is likely to affect the safety of the subjects or the conduct of the study. Moreover will be responsibility of the Coordinating Investigator of informing in writing all clinical investigators about all serious adverse events and all serious adverse device effects occurring during the study. This information shall be sent to the clinical investigators based on perceived risk. DIRECT ACCESS TO ORIGINAL DOCUMENTATION The Investigator will have to allow the national Regulatory Authority, and the staff designed by the Independent Ethical Committee or by coordinating investigator direct access to the complete original documentation _ and its verification _ including informed consent, signed by the enrolled patients or by their Legal Representatives, and the clinical records or outpatient registers. People who have direct access to this documentation will have to take all reasonable precautions in order to maintain the patient identity and all information which is property of the Coordinating Investigator, in compliance with applicable laws. QUALITY ASSURANCE PROCEDURES The Organization, Monitoring and Quality Assurance of the present study will be under the responsibility of the Coordinating Investigator. Clinical Monitoring The clinical monitoring will be carried out by qualified persons assigned by the Coordinating Investigator and will be conducted according to the guidelines of the ISO Standard 14155_1. Additionally the monitoring activities will include the verification of the correct filling of the CRFs and, when applicable, the consistence between source documents and the electronic stored data used for the randomization procedures. The coordinating investigator will ensure the practical training for the personal involved in the study on the surgical and medical techniques and on filling the CRFs. Data Review and Audits Data Review and Audits will be carried out by qualified persons assigned by the Coordinating Investigator. The CRFs will be periodically reviewed. Financing of the study No financial aspect must be taken into account because no funding is foreseen for the present study.

Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) (week _18, month 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12) At 8:00_9:00 a.m., after a 12_h overnight fast, an intravenous catheter is placed in one antecubital vein to draw blood samples. An OGTT (75 g of glucose) is performed in 10 minutes maximum and blood samples obtained at _20, _5, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160 and 180 min relative to the start of the OGTT. Samples are placed in chilled tubes, and plasma is separated within 20 min and stored at _70¡C. Analytical Methods Plasma glucose will be measured by the glucose_oxidase method (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). Plasma insulin will be assayed by microparticle_enzyme immunoassay (Abbott, Pasadena, CA) with a sensitivity of 1 _U/ml and an intra_assay CV of 6.6%. C_peptide will be assayed by radioimmunoassay (MYRIA; Technogenetics, Milan, Italy): minimal detectable concentration =17 pmol/l and inter_ and intra_assay CVs of 3.3_5.7 and 4.6 _5.3, res ectively. Mathematical modeling: to be detailed."
Nct	Treatment of Low Metabolic Rate Following Bariatric Surgery	2012		CN-01503403	"Research Objectives: The primary objective is to apply an effective medical weight loss treatment to post bariatric surgery patients to enhance their weight loss through stimulation of thermogenesis and lipolysis and retention of lean body mass. This treatment using ephedrine with phosphodiesterase inhibitor (caffeine or theophylline) has been extensively documented as safe and effective in the medical weight loss setting but has not been applied to post_bariatric surgery patients in a placebo controlled, double blind, randomized study. From preliminary studies this treatment should be effective, especially in the treatment of post_surgical patients who continue to have difficulty losing weight despite good activity levels and significant calorie restriction. Clinical Relevance: Raum and others have been treating patients presenting with low metabolic rates during medical and bariatric surgery induced weight loss for many years with ephedrine in combination with caffeine and/or theophylline. All the literature outlined below for the last 40 years have been conducted only during medical weight loss. There are no randomized trials in surgical patients. Abstracts and expert opinion papers have been published but without randomization or blinding. Ephedrine has become controversial despite considerable evidence of its safe and effective treatment of airway resistance (asthma) for 50 years, and its use for medical weight loss (to stimulate REE and prevent loss of lean body mass) since 1974. An association with a non_regulated food additive, ephedra sparked the initial problems with inappropriate dosing, lack of physician supervision for patient selection and sensationalism in the lay press unsupported by peer_reviewed studies to contradict previous favorable studies. Secondly, using ephedrine and pseudoephedrine as substrate for the illegal manufacture of methamphetamine, caused an aura of further unreasoned apprehension. Because ephedrine with caffeine or theophylline is one of the few drug combinations that can potentially reverse a low REE and allow a successful weight loss following bariatric surgery, a randomized, controlled study is needed to determine if this effect is statistically and clinically significant in patients having bariatric surgery. The effect of ephedrine on body composition has been studied. Two groups were given a very low calorie diet. Placebo or Ephedrine in combinations with or without methylxanthines and/or aspirin (110 mg tid) in an 8 week trial demonstrated no side effects. The ephedrine groups lost 4.5 kg more fat and 2.5 kg less lean than the placebo, significant differences. REE fell 13% in the placebo group, but only 8% in the ephedrine groups (18). A few examples of the literature were highlighted above that reflect similar studies that can be found in extensive reviews of ephedrine on weight loss (19_26), energy balance and thermogenesis (27,28). The difference between these two contrasting sets of data demonstrates that the unregulated use of ephedrine_containing compounds in unknown and potentially lethal doses in susceptible populations is not to be encouraged. But in preparations where dosage is known and controlled, given in appropriately selected populations, ephedrine with caffeine is safe and effective. References available on request. Power analysis was performed with results from our previous studies in non_randomized subjects treated for 2 months. SPECIFIC AIMS Background and Current Research Following bariatric surgery, metabolic rate decreases secondary to a decrease in sympathetic activity and lean body mass preventing optimal weight loss (1_3). Patients reaching this ""plateau"" during weight loss be it medical or surgical is well recognized. The plateau is reached when there is no longer a significant difference between calories burned and calories consumed. The equation can be modified at either end. High calorie intake is, by far, the most common reason given for lack of weight loss. The advice provided is to decrease calorie intake. However, there is large subgroup of individuals whose metabolic rate (measured as Resting Energy Expenditure _ REE or Resting Metabolic Rate _ RMR) decreases while caloric intake has remained low. Raum (3) has routinely measured REE in bariatric surgery patients for 10 years. A low REE is commonly associated with a reduced weight loss rate. Hundreds of patients have been found to have REEs significantly depressed from normal (90_s100%) to a range of 45% to 80% and a mean of 65%. These patients have a deficit of 500 to more than 1000 kcal per day that they would be burning with a normal REE. Some patients must consume less than 700 to 1000 kcal/day just to maintain their weight. The methods to increase REE, sympathetic activity, brown adipose tissue activity include exercise, and several drugs including catechins (green tea), caffeine or theophylline with ephedrine, and capsaicin (1). Many clinical trials have demonstrated the effect of ephedrine on weight loss (4_7). A significant effect of ephedrine on increasing metabolism is thought to be one of the mechanisms for weight loss. Stimulation of brown adipose tissue was thought to contribute to 15% of the increase in thermogenesis and the remainder due to thermogenesis in muscle (8). Combinations of ephedrine with methylxanthines (caffeine and/or theophylline) are noted to be even more effective in raising metabolic rates. These effects were most notable in post_obese patients who had some lost some weight, and had depressed metabolic rates. REE increased 8% in the post_obese but had no effect in lean subjects. In the previously obese subjects, the ephedrine_methylxanthine combination normalized the defective thermogenic response to a meal (9). In a 24_week trial with 20 mg of ephedrine and 200 mg of caffeine tid were randomized with placebo. The ephedrine/caffeine group lost 17.5% of body weight with 25% of the weight loss attributed to thermogenesis (10). The thermogenic effect of ephedrine may be lost early in treatment but is restored with the addition of aminophylline (11). EXPERIMENTAL STUDY DESIGN Patients who have been medically cleared for gastric bypass surgery and meet the inclusion criteria or are not eliminated by the exclusion criteria will be offered the opportunity to enroll in the study. Patients will be enrolled in the study, IRB consents obtained, and randomized to treatment or control groups prior to surgery. Patients will follow all usual preoperative and postoperative surgical and medical investigations and care. This includes a baseline resting energy expenditure (REE) and body composition measurement (BC) before surgery. Study visits will usually occur at the same times as normal follow up visits and vital signs and weights obtained. Considerable recent controversy about the safety of ephedrine has come to pass due to the widespread use of an herbal food additive, ephedra, being marketed widely beginning in the late 1990s. Ephedrine had been used without controversy from the 1960s until this time. Many anecdotal reports were circulated, including over 18,000 case reports. These and 550 trials were reviewed in a meta_analysis (30). Of these reports less than 10% of the trials could be scientifically assessed and of these only 22 consisted of a placebo with some combination of ephedrine, ephedra, caffeine or other herbs. These remaining studies demonstrated a 2.2 to 3.6 fold increase in one or more of the following grouped subjective complaints, psychological, gastrointestinal, autonomic symptoms, and/or palpitations. Presumably the other 90% of actual trials did not test or did not highlight these symptoms. Other papers (31_33) which were reviews of various types of reports (not designed studies) described instances of acute intoxication resulting in strokes, heart attacks, seizure and even death. Because of the uncontrolled nature of the data in the reports, doses, combinations with other drugs, and frequency or duration of exposure were unknown, they could only state whether the associations with ephedra were possible or probable. Other researc observed no significant adverse effects or only temporary minor effects with ephedra, ephedrine and caffeine (13, 14, 34_37). These studies were double_blind placebo controlled in selected populations. Multiple clinical weight loss trials have measured the chronic and acute effects of combinations of ephedrine (30, 60 and 150 mg per day) with caffeine (300 to 600 mg per day) up to 180 subjects over 24 weeks (10, 12_15). Acutely, mean arterial pressure is increased by 9 mm/Hg and pulse by 7 beats per minute. By 8 weeks the side effects of tremor, insomnia, dizziness and blood pressure initially noted with ephedrine were equal to placebo. In some studies side effects were only seen at the highest dose of 50 mg tid (16). No adverse effects were noted with a dose of ephedrine 25 mg and caffeine 200 mg tid for 10 days on cardiovascular function as measured by thoracic bio_impedance, automatic sphygmomanometry, continuous electrocardiographic recording or ergometric exercise (17). Body composition will be measured by body impedance analysis with a Quantum III BIA from RJL Systems (Michigan). This is a high quality, reproducible system using electrode placement on hands and feet. While DEXA body scans may provide more detailed information the research cost for these measurements in this study would exceed the cost of the medications alone. The investigators have three RJL systems in the clinic and the total body lean mass compares well the comparable measurements obtained with the DEXA. REE is measured using a Sensor Medics indirect calorimeter with O2 and CO2 measurements to calculate REE. This equipment is located and managed by the Respiratory Therapy Department at Good Samaritan Hospital and has been calibrated, tested and used in other funded research studies. The test is done fasting, without morning medications with minimal pretest activity (15 minutes at rest prior to starting the test), and normal fluid balance. The equipment is calibrated before each test. Patients will begin taking ephedrine/caffeine or placebo capsules at 5 weeks after surgery in a gradual tapering dose upward beginning with one capsule daily and increasing each week by one capsule until taking three capsules per day. For the treatment group this would be 75 mg of ephedrine and 600 mg of caffeine per day. At 8 weeks after surgery they will return for an office visit, vital signs taken, BC done, symptom checklist completed and reviewed, and if not experiencing any significant side effects they will be given a 6 weeks supply of capsules. At 14 weeks after surgery they have and office visit with vital signs taken, symptom checklist completed and reviewed and be given another 6 week supply of capsules. At 20 weeks after surgery they have and office visit with vital signs taken, symptom checklist completed and reviewed, and an REE study will be obtained at Good Samaritan hospital and body composition by bioimpedance in the clinic and be given another 6 week supply of capsules. At 26 weeks after surgery they have and office visit with vital signs taken, symptom checklist completed and reviewed and be given another 6 week supply of capsules. At 32 weeks after surgery they will return for an office visit for vital signs, a symptom checklist and an REE study will be obtained at Good Samaritan hospital and body composition by bioimpedance in the clinic. They will be given a taper pack of capsules that will be accomplished over 3 weeks. At the clinic visits noted above vital signs, and body weight will be obtained. Patients will be questioned about any side effects. They will also be encouraged to call between visits if they have persistent side effects, and will be given a symptom checklist to compare over the phone. As usual routine medical and surgical care will be provided at these visits. Adjustments in medications for blood pressure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, nutritional deficiencies and so forth will be addressed and treated as usual. Any surgical interventions for wound problems, hernias, or other complications will be attended to and routine lood tests or any other diagnostic tests needed, will be done. If blood pressure cannot be controlled to < 140/80, or pulse < 100, or patient experiences excessive adrenergic side effects, the treatment will be stopped, but the patient will continue with usual follow up medical and surgical care. The investigators will continue to collect measurements on patients who are unable to tolerate the treatment until the end of the study. Patients may withdraw, however, at anytime without any repercussions and will continue to receive regular care. Body weights are obtained on an electronic scale, capacity 800 pounds, with shoes off and patients are advised to wear the same light weight clothes at each visit. The scale's calibration is checked quarterly (a requirement of current and prior research studies). The investigators use a Welch_Allyn automatic cuff for blood pressure and pulse. Two measurements are obtained in each arm at each visit. The investigators have multiple size cuffs to match upper arm diameter. Calibration checked quarterly as research protocols have required."

Nct	Effects of Preoperative Respiratory Physical Therapy on Postoperative Respiratory Function After Bariatric Surgery	2013		CN-01541523	"Background. Morbidly obese patients show an increased risk of hypoxemia during the postoperative period resulting in a higher incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications and prolonged hospital length of stay when compared with normal weight subjects. Mechanisms involved in this predisposition of morbidly obese patients for develop this physiopathologic scheme include a greater impairment on the respiratory mechanics induced by general anesthesia and paralysis _greater reduction in pulmonary and chest compliances and higher airway resistance_ and an increment in ventilatory requirements. That leads to an increased work of breathing (WOB) and oxygen consumption (VO2). These effects are exaggerated in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery because the direct effects of the pneumoperitoneum on the pulmonary mechanics. In addition, in morbidly obese patients respiratory muscles show a reduction in both strength and endurance probably a cause of the fatty tissular infiltration and the exacerbated inflammatory response usually observed in these patients. Respiratory physical therapy has shown to be effective and reduce postoperative pulmonary complications both, as postoperative treatment and when given preoperatively. When applied postoperatively respiratory physiotherapy has proved to be able to expand pulmonary volumes and to improve arterial oxygenation, leading to decreases in postoperative pulmonary complications, specially after abdominal surgery. In the specific setting of morbidly obese patients submitted to bariatric surgery, postoperative inspiratory muscle training (IMT ) improves inspiratory muscle strength and endurance allowing an earlier recovery of pulmonary airflows. There are scanty data about the results of applying respiratory physiotherapy on the preoperative period. However it has proved to be able to reduce the postoperative incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications in some different settings: (1) In patients after thoracic surgery, (2) In patients undergoing CABG surgery, specially in those considered at high risk for pulmonary complications and (3) after upper abdominal surgery. At our knowledge no studies aimed to determine wether preoperative respiratory physiotherapy could improve the postoperative respiratory function in morbidly obese patients have been published. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a preoperative respiratory physical therapy program on the postoperative respiratory function in morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric laparoscopic surgery. Fifty morbid obese patients (BMI³40%) consecutively scheduled for laparoscopic bariatric surgery were considered eligible. All subjects were treated by the same surgical team and were submitted to the same anesthetic procedures. All the patients were informed about the objectives and interventions of the study and signed an informed consent form. The protocol was approved by the local Human Research Ethics Committee. Tracheal extubation was performed in the RTDL position (30¼). Fully monitored patients were then transferred to the PACU in a semi_sitting position, while receiving a high flow of oxygen in air at a FiO2 of 0.5. Postoperative analgesia in the first 12 h was intravenous paracetamol (1 g every 6 h) and intravenous dexketoprofen (50 mg every 8 h) for all patients. All the functional data were obtained by the same investigator, namely, the physical therapist. The sample size was calculated using the repeated measures of the PaO2/FiO2 ratio in the postoperative period as the primary endpoint. Assuming that an increment of 25% or more in this parameter (effect size of 0.25) would be of clinical importance, with an alfa error probability of 0.05 and a power of 0.95, a required sample size of 44 patients was obtained. To account for attrition a proportion of 15% was added, reaching a total sample size of 50 patients. The calculation was carried out by means of the GPower 3.1.5 application for statistics. After inclusion, the informed consent procedure, and evaluation of baseline c aracteristics, the study patients were randomly and blindly divided into two groups: control group (CG) and intervention group (RPT). Randomization was done with a computer generated randomization table and individual closed sealed envelopes. An investigator blinded to the allocation sequence picked consecutive allocation envelopes for consecutive participants. Surgery was scheduled on the day 32 to 36 from the baseline day for all patients. Anesthetic management was standardized. Patients received no premedication. In the operating room patients were placed in reverse trendelemburg (RTDL) position (30¼). Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at 10 cmH2O was applied to all patients during the administration of oxygen in air (FiO2 0.8) for 5 minutes. After preoxygenation anesthesia was induced with propofol, 3 mg.kg_1 based on ideal body weight (IBW= X + 0.91* height (cm) _ 152,4_1; X = 50 for men; X= 45 for women) and fentanyl 0,1 microg.kg_1, followed by rocuronium 0.6 mg. kg_1. Then all the patients were ventilated using pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a inspiratory pressure of 10 cmH2O, PEEP 10 cmH2O and a minimum respiratory rate of 10 breaths.min_1 (Ventilator Engstrm CS, GE Healthcare, Finland). When neuromuscular blockade was complete tracheal intubation was performed maintaining the RTDL position at 30¼. The radial artery was cannulated for continuous monitoring of arterial blood pressure and arterial blood gas measurements. Anesthesia was maintained by continuous infusion of propofol and remifentanil to target a bispectral index ª (XP version 3.0, Aspect Medical Inc. Norwood, MA) between 40 and 50. Neuromuscular blockade was maintained with rocuronium and continuously monitored (TOF Watch, Bluestar Enterprises, Inc., Chanhassen, MN). Remifentanil was discontinued at the time of the removal of the laparoscope. Residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed with neostigmine, 0.05 mg/kg IV (IBW). Normothermia was maintained intraoperatively using a forced warm air system (Bair Hugger¨, Arizant Healthcare Inc., Eden Prairie, MN, USA). Spirometry was performed according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) recommendations, employing the above mentioned spirometer (Datospir_600D) previously calibrated . Three acceptable curves and two replicable ones were considered, allowing a maximum of eight attempts to each patient. The choices of the best values were done according to ATS criteria . The obtained values were expressed as percentage of normal values calculated according to Knudson et al. Intraoperative mechanical ventilation was the same for both groups of patients. The lungs were ventilated with volume controlled ventilation (VCV) with a mixture of 50% oxygen in air, and a tidal volume of 6 mL.kg_1 (IBW), inspiratory to expiratory ratio 1:2, and PEEP 10 cmH2O. Respiratory rate was adjusted to maintain end_tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure (etCO2) between 30 and 35 mmHg. An alveolar recruitment strategy (ARS) was applied after the onset of pneumoperitoneum. ARS was performed by increasing PEEP in increments of 5 cmH2O from 0 to 20 cmH2O using pressure controlled ventilation with a driving pressure similar to the airways plateau pressure obtained during VCV. Once PEEP reached 20 cmH2O the driving pressure was augmented to reach 45 cmH2O. After 10 breaths at maximal airways pressure, PEEP was decreased in steps of 2 cmH2O and static compliance of the respiratory system was measured at each step in order to determine the lung's closing pressure. Then a second ARS was applied and PEEP was set at 2 cm H2O higher than the closing pressure. At the end of surgery a new ARS was applied, before the extubation. In this case PEEP after the ARS was kept in 10 cmH2O until the extubation. In order to know the training effects we recorded the patient follow_up to the physical therapy program and measured forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), maximal inspiratory pressure (PiMAX), and maximal expiratory pressure (PeMAX) (Datospir_600D, SIBEL SA Spain) befo e and at the end of the 30 days of training. All the patients were also instructed and trained about these measurements, aiming to avoid any learning effect during the study. The measurements were performed with the patients on a sitting position and wearing a nasal clip. PiMAX was measured from residual volume and PeMAX from total lung capacity. Five maneuvers were performed for each patient, and the three most acceptable were registered. The highest value obtained was considered for calculations."

Nct	Glossopharyngeal Nerve Block for Awake Intubation	2013		CN-01540470	"Research design 1.1 Study design Prospective randomized control trial. 1.2 Patients All morbidly obese patient presenting for bariatric surgery at the Royal Victoria Hospital are eligible. 1.3 Exclusions We will exclude any patient with _ moderate to severe systemic illness, i.e. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score of 4 or higher _ inability to communicate in English or French _ contraindications to the drugs used in the study 1.4 Recruitment Eligible patients admitted to Royal Victoria Hospital who do not have any of the exclusion criteria will be approached by one of the investigators in the recovery room, or in the preoperative clinic before the scheduled surgery. The study protocol will be explained and a consent form will be given to the patients. Patients will have time and opportunity to ask any questions before the consent will be signed. 1.5 Study protocol Patients will be prepared for surgery according to the routine guidelines established by the Departments of Surgery and Anesthesia at the Royal Victoria Hospital. They will have an IV and peripheral arterial line inserted, and will have Canadian Anesthesia Society standard monitors placed. Glycopyrrolate 0.4 mg iv will be given to decrease secretions. Using a computer generated randomization table, patients will be assigned to a group that receives standard airway anesthesia with 20 ml of aerosolized 2% lidocaine and peritonsillar instillation of gauze soaked in normal saline (Control Group) or that receives 20 ml of aerosolized 2% lidocaine and peritonsillar instillation of gauze soaked with 2% lidocaine (Glossopharyngeal Group). Sedation will be administered using a remifentanyl intravenous infusion of 0.05 /min with an initial bolus of 0.4µg/kg, and intravenous midazolam 0.05 mg/kg. We will review the chart to obtain patient demographic data including patient age, height, weight, medications, and past medical histories. Baseline blood pressure, heart rate, will be recorded, and a blood sample will be drawn for lidocaine level. Once the airway is topicalized and sedation has taken effect, the anesthesiologist will insert the video laryngoscope into the patient's oropharynx. Once the ideal view of the vocal cords is obtained, an endotracheal tube fitted with a stylet will be introduced into the pharynx, and then slid through the vocal cords into the trachea. During the intubation attempt, a blinded observer will record the blood pressure and heart rate at every minute, and the best view obtained with the laryngoscope. The observer will assign the patient a reaction score (4) at three time points: the insertion of the video laryngoscope, the pharyngeal insertion of the tracheal tube, and the tracheal insertion of the tracheal tube. This score will be: 1. No reaction 2. Single change in facial expression 3. Grimacing facial expression 4. Severe facial grimace, no reflex head movements 5. Severe facial grimace with head movements 6. Severe facial grimace with head and limb movements The observer will also record the time from the insertion of the video laryngoscope, and the first evidence of endtidal carbon dioxide from the tracheal tube. If the intubation attempt results in a reaction score of 6, or in an inadequate laryngeal view, the treating anesthesiologist may secure the airway in any way they see fit, which may include addition of more topical anesthesia, more sedation, or the use of another airway technique. The number of attempts at intubation, and any other techniques used for intubation will be recorded. We will measure lidocaine levels in blood samples every 10 minutes for 40 minutes after the commencement of the airway anesthesia, using the mass spectrometry method previously used for similar studies at the Royal Victoria Hospital."
Nct	Prevention and Treatment Of Diabetes Complications With Gastric Surgery or Intensive Medicines	2013		CN-01478758	"Currently 205 million patients in the world suffer with Type 2 diabetes and severe and complex obesity. The obesity is defined as a body mass index above 30 kg/m2 with life or limb threatening co_morbidities. The bariatric surgery increase in worldwide, but their effects on the microvascular complications of T2DM have never been the focus of a randomised controlled clinical trial. To address this research question a three arms on randomised controlled clinical trial comparing gastric bypass surgery, sleeve gastrectomy and modern best medical care is required to investigate differences in long term glycaemia and microvascular complications of T2DM. This is a prospective intervention study on patients with T2DM and obesity undergoing gastric bypass surgery, sleeve gastrectomy or non surgical best medical care. Patients will have T2DM for more than 2 years and have or be at high risk of developing kidney damage. Patients will be recruited from specialist medical and surgical clinics. We expect to screen approximately 300 patients to allow 75 to be randomized. Twenty five subjects with kidney damage or high risk of kidney damage secondary to T2DM will undergo gastric bypass surgery. Another 25 sleeve gastrectomy and the final 25 will be treated using the American Diabetes Association protocol. Patients with HbA1c ³9.0% will undergo individualised optimisation of glycaemia as this should improve surgical outcomes. Particular attention will be given to the avoidance of hypoglycaemia. Patients' other risk factors (including hypertension and dyslipidaemia) will be optimised based on the International Diabetes Federation guidelines. The clinical endpoints that will be assessed are: renal function, peripheral and autonomic nervous system function, the retina, of direct healthcare cost, glycaemic control, blood pressure, lipids, quality of life, postprandial responses, treatment complications."
Nct	Preop CPET Testing and Exercise Training in Colorectal Patients	2013		CN-01489628	"The study will be conducted in two parts: Part 1. Study to examine the ability of CPET to predict outcomes in patients undergoing colorectal surgery: Objectives To identify which CPET variables or combination of variables are most useful in the prediction of post_operative complications following colorectal surgery. In addition, to examine whether CPET variables can be used in combination with other scoring systems or blood tests to increase accuracy of prediction. The aim of this investigation is to develop an accurate prediction model from key clinically relevant predictor variables, including CPET variables, blood tests and risk scoring systems. Such a model could be used in clinical practice to predict pre_operative outcome and thus help risk stratify patients for post_operative surveillance or management. Study Population The Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital undertakes approximately 300 procedures for colorectal cancers per year. Patients scheduled for cancer surgery will be recruited to the trial. Study Outline Informed consent to participate in the trial will be obtained in the outpatient setting after diagnosis/scheduling of surgery through discussion with the medical team and the colorectal nurse specialists. All patients will follow a standardised peri_operative pathway devised in conjunction with the surgical and anaesthetic team. Sample Size A sample size of a minimum of 90 patients has been identified, based on comparable studies with other patient groups in the literature. Predictor Variables Supervised pre_operative CPET testing will take place in the exercise laboratory at the University of East Anglia before surgery. The test is done by pedalling on a stationary bicycle, the resistance to pedalling will gradually increase, similar to when cycling up a hill. As the subject rides the stationary bike, the amount of oxygen used, and how fast/efficiently their heart beats is calculated. Breathing will be measured through a face mask or a mouth piece and the electrical activity of the heart will be measured via sensors placed on the chest. Each CPET test takes around 30 minutes to complete. For each participant in this part of the study, only one CPET test will be done prior to surgery at a convenient time. In addition to the standard pre_surgery blood tests that all NHS patients receive, blood will be taken to measure several key serum markers which have been associated with post_operative outcomes in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery (pro_BNP, CRP, albumin and IL_6). Scoring systems will be applied to patient data as additional indicators of peri_operative risk _ these are systems which involve calculating a measure of risk based on other co_existing illnesses the patient may have. Data Collection Patient notes will be reviewed on each postoperative day to identify postoperative complications according to the Post_Operative Morbidity Survey system (POMS), this is a scoring tool previously used in other studies which assesses different systems of the body to determine 'morbidity' according to defined criteria (pulmonary, infection, renal, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, wound complications, haematological and pain. Time taken until pain relief is satisfactory, ability to eat and drink, satisfactory level of mobility/self_care and bowel function will also be recorded. Length of hospital stay and time taken until the patient is medically fit for discharge will also be recorded. Part 2: Feasibility of a randomised prehabilitation programme in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer Objectives Study Population (as above) Study Outline Following baseline CPET testing to assess initial background fitness, patients will be randomised to one of two study arms: To determine the feasibility of implementing a structured, supervised exercise programme for patients awaiting elective colorectal cancer surgery. The results of this study will be used to inform a larger randomised controlled trial to examine the influence of exercise on CPET variables and postope ative outcomes. 1. a supervised aerobic exercise training pathway + standard treatment or 2. standard treatment without supervised exercise training To adequately assess key feasibility outcomes, a sample size of 60 patients (30 in each arm of the study) will be used. Patients randomised to exercise training will be offered three sessions of supervised aerobic exercise per week over the subsequent 4 weeks before their procedure to be conducted in the exercise lab at the University of East Anglia. Each session will include a few simple freehand exercises as well as some time on the treadmill or a fixed exercise bike. The sessions will last about an hour each and will be tailored to individual fitness levels. Heart rate, clinical signs, blood pressure and perceived exertion will be recorded regularly throughout exercise. This exercise protocol is currently in use in a study of elderly patients with bladder cancer awaiting surgery and is well_tolerated. Repeat CPET testing will then take place 4 weeks from the baseline test in the exercise laboratory (on the day prior to surgery) to determine changes (if any) in CPET variables. The patients in the non_exercise arm of the study will not undergo any exercise intervention but will be CPET tested in the exercise laboratory at the same time points as the exercise arm patients. The data from these patients (n=30) will be used to contribute to the first part of the study (CPET variables as predictors of outcome). All patients will be CPET tested again at 3 months post_surgery to assess how well they have returned to their baseline function following their operation. Patients will be given follow_up questionnaires at this time, and again at 6 months post_surgery to assess health_related quality of life and psychological outcomes. The questionnaires used will be: CHAMPS Physical Activity Questionnaire for older adults, The Satisfaction with Life Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), FACT_F and the FACT_C scale to assess disease_specific quality of life. Data collection: As before, patient notes will be reviewed and post_operative complications identified. In addition, this study will assess the feasibility of conducting this trial on a larger scale: to identify the number of eligible patients, recruitment rate, willingness of patients to be randomised, willingness of clinicians to participate in the trial, compliance/tolerance of the exercise regimen, and patient satisfaction with the process. In addition, the costs of undergoing CPET testing and supervised exercise training will be estimated. An assessment of key health outcomes will also be undertaken, i.e. changes in CPET variables following exercise training, postoperative complications, length of stay, and health_related quality of life benefits, thus enabling the planning of a larger trial."
Nct	An RCT of Bariatric Surgery vs a Community Weight Loss Programme for the Sustained Treatment of IIH	2014		CN-02042324	"Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition with an unknown cause or causes. The condition is associated with raised pressure in the brain and can cause disabling daily headaches and loss of sight, which can be permanent. The raised brain pressure squashes the nerves supplying the eye (also known as papilloedema) and this can affect vision. Over 90% of patients with IIH are overweight and weight loss is the most effective treatment. Other treatments for IIH have very little current evidence to support their use. Weight loss is difficult to maintain. This trial aims to compare two methods of weight loss, bariatric surgery and the most effective dietary programme commonly available, Weight Watchers, to see which offers the most effective sustainable treatment for IIH. Bariatric surgery is recommended by the NICE clinical guidelines for patients with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of over 40, or over 35 with a co_morbidity. Women suffering from IIH have a BMI on average around 38 and IIH is not recognised as a co_morbidity for bariatric surgery. This trial will recruit 64 women with IIH from Neurology and Ophthalmology clinics in UK NHS Trusts. They will be randomised and 32 participants will be allocated to the dietetic intervention arm, and be enrolled in their local Weight Watchers group. 32 participants will be allocated to the bariatric surgery arm, and will be referred to their local bariatric surgery pathway to receive bariatric surgery. Both groups of participants will be allocated to a treatment arm which is proven to bring about weight loss. Participants will then be followed up for five years, with the most important measurement being their brain pressure after one year of being in the trial. A further 20 obese women who don't suffer from IIH will be recruited to compare the baseline symptoms and biomarkers of those with IIH; they will take no further part in the study. 5 further healthy individuals will be scanned twice in an MRI test group to validate the MRI scan sequence to be used in the trial."
Nct	Effect of Two Diets With Different Content of Protein on Weight Loss in Adults With Metabolic Syndrome	2014		CN-02031278	"Our study was a randomised clinical trial with a 6_month follow_up in Mexican adult men and women (20_65 years) with Metabolic Syndrome (MS). The individuals were invited to participate from posters and social network advertising. The study was conducted in two Mexican clinics (Mexico City and Cuernavaca) for obesity and metabolic disorders, used by the Mexican National Institute of Public Health (INSP) as recruitment centers. The sample size was calculated using a formula that compares two means, an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 95%. Based on these calculations, we established a baseline sample of 118 adults. For the diagnosis of MS, we used the classification from the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), and therefore participants were required to have three or more of the following criteria: a) waist circumference ³90 cm in men and ³80 cm in women, b) triglycerides ³150 mg/dL, c) high density lipoprotein (HDL_cholesterol) <40 mg/dL in men and <50 mg/dL in women, d) blood pressure ³130/85 mmHg; and e) fasting glucose ³100 mg/dL. Exclusion criteria included bariatric surgery for weight loss, smoking, use of alcohol or drugs, psychiatric disorders, anti_obesity medication, soy protein intolerance, women not using birth control methods, and not pregnant or lactating, and body weight gain or loss greater than two percent three months prior to the start of the study. To achieve the baseline sample of 118 adults, 150 patients were screened; however, 32 were excluded because they did not meet the criteria. During screening, individuals interested in participating received an explanation of the study design and were given sufficient time to consider inclusion in the clinical trial and complete the form for informed consent. On the same day as consent, doctors wrote down medical history; nutritionists conducted anthropometry (weight, height, and waist circumference); and nurses measured blood pressure and withdrew venous blood for determination of glucose, triglycerides, and HDL_cholesterol. After the medical evaluation and nutritional status, we provided meal replacements enriched with soy protein that were consumed during the following two days, testing soy protein tolerance. Each clinic supervisor enrolled participants, and the study coordinator conducted the randomization sequencing and assigned participants to interventions. After being randomly assigned to one of two groups, the control group received a diet with a lower protein content (0.8gr/kg body weight), and the intervention group received a diet with higher protein content (1.34gr/kg body weight). Both diets had equal amount of calories, were equivalent in the type of carbohydrate, and had a caloric restriction of 500 calories less than the resting metabolic rate (RMR) based on the Harris_Benedict«s formula. The overall study design is shown in Figure 1. For the intervention group, meal replacements (drinks and bars) were made with soy protein, and indivi_dualized menus, controlling the content of calories, protein, carbohydrates, and fat, had more control over the total amount of protein consumed daily. After randomization (week 0), participants received specific diet instructions. Each month, diets contained 15 different options and were sufficient to meet the needs of micronutrients recommended by the US Institute of Medicine (recommended dietary intake) according to age and sex. In the intervention group, participants consumed two, protein_enriched drinks, contributing to the daily protein intake (1.34g protein/kg body weight) along with conventional foods and two low_fat bars. Used as a substitute for food, the protein_enriched drinks were prepared with 250ml of either milk with 1.5% fat or just water. The nutritional contents of the protein_enriched drink with milk contained 145 calories, 9g protein, 3g fat, and 20.5g carbohydrates. For water, the nutritional contents of the protein_enriched drink contained 22 calories, 5g protein, 0.2g fat, and 0g carbohydrates. In the control group, participants ate three meals and two snacks to have a daily intake of 0.8g protein/kg body weight. For both groups, the calorie density of the diet was adjusted for the baseline metabolic rate of each participant with a restriction of 500kcal/day. Measurements Previously trained on standards for procedure, nutritionists completed monthly documentation of food frequency questionnaires for participants« total caloric intake and grams of protein consumed per day. To minimize errors, the nutritionists and participants scrutinized and discussed the food diaries. The nutritionists also conducted anthropometry (weight and waist circumference) at baseline and at three and six months, using internationally recognized techniques.[14] The weight and body composition was measured by an Analyzer Avis 333, and the waist circumference was measured with a tape measure, using the line between the lower costal border and the iliac crest as reference points. At baseline, height was measured with a wall stadiometer (SECA Model 222) with an accuracy of 0.1cm. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight/height 2. Nurses measured blood pressure after 10 minutes of rest with a digital sphygmomanometer (OMRON HEM_907), following the recommendations of the American Heart Association. Blood samples were drawn after a 9_ to 12_hour fasting and processed without delay. Laboratory testing included results for metabolic syndrome and HDL_cholesterol, insulin, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), C_reactive protein (CRP), direct bilirubin and indirect bilirubin. All measurements were performed at the Mexican National Institute of Public Health (INSP). A previously validated questionnaire was used to evaluate adherence to study recommendations for diet and exercise (e.g., walking, biking or jogging at least 30 minutes/day, 5 days per week). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The results were shown for the baseline as mean ± standard deviation; and for the comparison between baseline to 6 months as absolute changes or percentage of weight loss. We used the analysis of variance (ANOVA) for means and X2 test for percentages to compare the two groups overtime. Two strategies were used to analyze the data: 1) all participants who completed the study after six months, and 2) those participants who dropped out of the study between baseline and six months, using the last recorded measure_ment. The analysis of percentage of weight loss between baseline and 6 months we adjusted for adherence to study recommendations. For this analysis, only the participants who adhered to a minimum of 75% of the study design recommendations were considered. Statistical calculations were performed using the STATA program version 13. Ethical and biosecurity This study was approved by the ethics, research, and biosafety committees from the INSP. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. All researchers participated in an ethics certification course, ""Human Participants Protection Education for Research Teams"", given by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH)."
Nct	Argon Plasma Coagulation for Bleeding Peptic Ulcers	2014		CN-02026080	"Patients and methods Study cohort Patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (AUGIB) who were admitted to Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital between January 2011 and January 2012 were screened. Inclusion criteria were (i) over 20 years of age and (ii) patients with high_risk peptic ulcer bleeding. Acute hemorrhage from upper gastrointestine was defined as classical presentation with hematemesis, coffee_ground emesis, and/or melena. High_risk bleeding ulcers were defined as participants with stigmata of a bleeding visible vessels (eg, spurting, oozing), a non_bleeding visible vessels (NBVV) or adherent clot.4 A NBVV at endoscopy was defined as a raised red, red_blue or pale hemispheric vessel protruding from the ulcer bed, without active bleeding. An adherent clot was defined as an overlying blood clot that was resistant to vigorous irrigation. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) the presence of another possible bleeding site (eg, gastroesophageal varix, gastric cancer, reflux esophagitis); (ii) coexistence of actively severe ill diseases (eg, septic shock, stroke, myocardial infarction, surgical abdomen); (iii) treatment with an anticoagulant (eg, warfarin); (iv) pregnancy; (v) the presence of operated stomach or; (vi) refusal to participate in the study.

Patients will be taken to the OR and anesthetized using standard procedures of the Texas Children's Hospital (TCH) department of anesthesia, including monitoring according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists guidelines (EKG, pulse oximetry, BP, temperature and end_tidal expired carbon dioxide and inhalation anesthetic gases). If the Attending Anesthesiologist believes the child is at risk for aspiration of gastric contents, a rapid sequence induction with propofol 3_4 mg/kg and succinylcholine 1mg/kg IV will be performed with cricoid pressure, in keeping with standard practices. In other patients an IV will be started after induction of anesthesia. An age appropriate endotracheal tube or appropriate sized laryngeal mask airway (LMA) will be inserted in all patients. Anesthesia will be maintained with sevoflurane, nitrous oxide and oxygen, adjusted to keep blood pressure and heart rate within 20% of baseline values, in keeping with standard practices. All patients will receive ketorolac 0.5mg/kg IV. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into one of two study groups: ultrasound guided supraclavicular block or IV opioids, based on a computer generated random number by using Random Allocation Software For Parallel Group Randomized Trials. The assignment will be made only after written informed consent has been obtained. There will be an equal chance a child will be assigned to one of the two groups. Patients randomized to the systemic analgesia group will receive 1mcg/kg of fentanyl IV after induction. Patients randomized to the supraclavicular block group will receive an ultrasound guided nerve block with 0.2 ml/kg ropivacaine 0.5% (maximum 10 ml), using the technique described by Marhofer et al. In order to decrease variance in success rates, the ultrasound guided nerve block will be performed by 1 of the 4 anesthesiology co_investigators, each of whom have successfully performed over 100 ultrasound guided blocks in the past. Supraclavicular blocks were performed using the higher frequency of the probe and placing it in a coronal_oblique_plane in the supraclavicular fossa. The brachial plexus will be identified as a cluster of hypoechoic nodules, lateral to the round pulsating hypoechoic subclavian artery and lying on top of the hyperechoic first rib. The cupola of the lung will be identified. If the transverse colli artery is visualized cephalically surrounding the plexus, the probe will be moved toward a better coronal oblique plane, directing the ultrasound beam slightly caudally, in order to keep the artery away from the plexus. The needle will be was carefully introduced using an in_plane (IP) technique from lateral to medial, toward but not into the brachial plexus. The entire needle image will be visualised at all times to ensure it does not enter the vessel, nerve plexus or pleura. The spread of local anesthetic to all targets of the plexus will be observed on the ultrasound image. At the time of their follow up visit to the surgeon, a complete physical examination will be done including a neurological evaluation for any nerve injury. The time taken to place the block will be recorded from the time the ultrasound probe is first placed on the child until completion of local anesthetic injection. The observer collecting postoperative data will not be present when the block is placed, and a band_aid will be placed over the supraclavicular fossa in all patients to maintain blinding of the observer to the group assignment. During the operation patients can receive intraoperative fentanyl, 1 mcg/kg IV at a time, if the attending anesthesiologist believes it is clinically indicated. At the end of the operation, anesthetic gases will be discontinued while the patient breathes 100% oxygen. The trachea will be extubated when the patient responds to commands, and the child will then be taken to the Post Anesthetic Care Unit (PACU) in keeping with standard practices . A validated pain scale (verbal rating scale where 0 = no pain and 10 = worst possible pain ever) will be used throughout to assess the severity of pain in the postoperative period. In keeping with current practice, patients with pain scores>4 will be treated with morphine 0.05mg/kg IV at 10 minute intervals until the score is below 4. Oral acetaminophen with hydrocodone (Lortab elixir 0.15mg/kg hydrocodone) will be administered to children for pain scores between 2_ 3. Supplemental oxygen, rescue antiemetic and antipruritic drugs will be administered in keeping with standard practices of TCH and the clinical judgment of the Attending Anesthesiologist. The duration of supplemental oxygen therapy, any medication administered and complications (side effects such as nausea, vomiting, itching, respiratory depression, prolonged awakening) will be recorded on the case report form. The blinded observer will record pain scores within 15 minutes of arrival in the PACU and at 30 minutes, 1,2,6,12,24, and 48 hours after arrival in the PACU. If the child is sleeping at this time, the scores will be recorded when awake. Prior to discharge home, parents will be educated on use of the 0_10 pain scale and given a diary to keep an accurate record of postoperative pain issues through the study period. The goal is to capture maximum pain scores at rest and with movement. Patient and parental satisfaction with pain management and with the global perioperative experience will also be graded on a numeric scale 0_10 scale. Time to readiness for discharge will also be measured from the time the patient enters the PACU to when the patient attains an Aldrete score of 9_10. This is a standardized scale used to assess discharge readiness at TCH and is listed below: Aldrete Scoring System Activity Can move voluntarily or on command 4 extremities 2 2 extremities 1 0 extremities 0 Respiration Can deep_breathe and cough freely 2 Dyspnea, shallow or limited breathing 1 Apneic 0 Circulation Preoperative BP (mmHg) BP ± 20 mmHg of baseline 2 BP ± 20_50 mmHg of baseline 1 BP ± 20 mmHg 0 Consciousness Fully Awake 2 Arousable on calling 1 Not responding 0 Color Normal 2 Pale, dusky, blotchy 1 Cyanotic 0 Score of 10: ready for discharge If the patient is discharged before the end of a 48 hour period after surgery, they will be given a diary to complete to list all medications given, and to assess their pain at various time intervals (12,24, 48 hours after surgery), along with their satisfaction with pain control. The patient will be contacted after discharge to obtain the data in the diary. Phone calls will also be placed on POD #1,2, & 3 to the family following to assess measured endpoints (pain, medication usage, satisfaction, resolution of nerve block)."
Nct	The Laryngeal Mask Airway in Edentulous Geriatric Patients	2014		CN-01547450	"After Ethical Committee approval and written informed consent were obtained, sixty edentulous patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status (ASA) grade I_III, aged over 65 years) undergoing elective surgery were included into the study. Patients with dentures had to remove their dentures before surgery at the ward. The supraglottic airway device was inserted into each patient in a random order. A statistician independent of the clinical investigators generated the randomization sequence using a computerized program. Patients were excluded if they had a known or predicted difficult airway, a body mass index > 35 kg/m2, or were at risk of aspiration. All cases were conducted by anesthetists who had experience over 5 years of LMA insertion. Demographic parameters, Mallampati classification and the duration of surgery were recorded. Patients were routinely monitored using ECG, non_invasive blood pressure measurement, pulse oximetry and end_tidal carbon dioxide tension. Depth of anesthesia was monitored with bispectral index (BIS). Patients were premedicated with midazolam 0.02 mg/kg when venous access was obtained. After 3 min preoxygenation with 100 % oxygen via face mask, anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 1_2 µg/kg and propofol 1_2 mg/kg. When the BIS value was 40_60 7 the predetermined supraglottic airway device was inserted according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The supraglottic airway devices were deflated fully before insertion. Size 4 LMA was used for those with a weight of 50_70 kg and size 5 LMA for those between 70_100 kg. After insertion, each device was inflated with a hand_held airway manometer (Rusch, Germany) to an intracuff pressure of 60 cm H2O. An effective airway was defined as the presence of normal thoracoabdominal movement and a square_wave end_tidal carbon dioxide trace. General anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, O2 and N2O. Insertion time was defined as the time from picking up the airway device until connection to the airway circuit. Ease of insertion was graded by the attending anesthesiologist as easy, fair or difficult. If after three attempts insertion was still not successful, the other device was used. If insertion of the other device also failed the patient was endotracheally intubated. Before the oropharyngeal leak test was carried out, the face of the patient was covered so that the observer was blinded to the airway device. The oropharyngeal leak pressure was determined by transiently stopping ventilation and closing the adjustable pressure_limiting valve with a fresh gas flow of 3 L/min until airway pressure reached a steady state and a voice of leakage was heard. The airway pressure was not allowed to exceed 40 cm H2O. After successful placement of the LMA Supremeª, a 12 French gauge gastric catheter was inserted via the gastric channel. Any episode of hypoxemia (SpO2 < 90%), aspiration or regurgitation,bronchospasm and airway obstruction were documented. After removal of the LMA, it was examined for the presence of visible blood. In the postanesthesia care unit, a research assistant, who was blinded to the group allocation, interviewed the patients using a predetermined questionnaire to collect data on the postoperative pharyngolaryngeal adverse events. The presence or absence of sore throat, dysphonia and dysphagia was assessed at 1 and 24 h postoperatively."
Nct	Effect on Energy Metabolism at Cellular Level of Diet Plus Treatment With Ephedrine and Caffeine in Obesity	2014		CN-02024163	"This trial was part of a sub_project of a multicentre study named ""Interaction between nutritional, social_behavioral and metabolic factors for prevention of cardiovascular disease: development of nutritional strategies on general population"" approved by the Italian Ministry of Health. The sub_project was specifically addressed to diet, thermogenesis and obesity. 2_ to 3_fold increase in UCP3 mRNA levels in lean and obese humans. 2. Because only a few, small studies have been done in humans to investigate the thermogenic effects of EC as compared to diet only, in the present study we examined the UCP3 expression in skeletal muscle and the beta_3 adrenoceptor expression in adipose tissue of pre_menopausal morbidly obese females treated with either placebo or EC for 30 days who subsequently underwent bariatric surgery. 3. Study subjects are adult females with morbid obesity i.e. body mass index ³ 40 kg/m2 selected from the waiting list for bariatric surgery at Department of Surgery (Molinette Hospital, Turin, Italy. During the treatment period all patients are fed a hypocaloric diet (total energy content of 70% of energy expenditure, as measured by indirect calorimetry), and containing 20% proteins, 55% carbohydrates, 25% fat half of which was monounsaturated, and 35 g/day fibres. Patients are randomised to 30_day treatment with either EC (200/20mg t.i.d.) or placebo. They are hospitalised, during the whole treatment period, at the metabolic unit of San Giuseppe Hospital_Istituto Auxologico Italiano at Piancavallo (VB, Italy). The EC administration starts with an initial dose of 100/10 mg t.i.d. for the first week and then proceeds with the full dose of 200/20 mg t.i.d. Resting energy expenditure is measured by indirect calorimetry at baseline and at the end of the study. The study pills (active compound and placebo) were prepared by the Hospital's Pharmacy. 4. In order to evaluate drug safety and effect on cardiac function, the blood pressure is measured three times a day; both electrocardiography and echocardiography are being recorded at baseline and every week. After diet and drug period, the patients are transferred to the Department of Surgery (Molinette Hospital, Turin) for the bariatric surgery. The drug treatment (EC and placebo) is stopped the day before surgical intervention. Small biopsies of rectus abdominis and of subcutaneous and omental adipose tissues are taken during surgery, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at _80¡C for subsequent analysis. 5. UCP3S and UCP3L mRNA levels are measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction at the Department of Pharmacology, University of Milan. Presence of beta_3 adrenoceptor in adipose tissue is evaluated by immunohistochemistry by the avidin_biotin peroxidase technique using monoclonal anti_human beta 3_adrenoceptor antibody at the Department of Human Anatomy, University of Ancona. 1. Ephedrine and caffeine (EC) combination has been widely used in human obesity treatment, and is still present in many herbal preparations sold widespread in many countries for weight loss. It is well known that this drug increases the metabolic rate in both animals and humans. Ephedrine is an agonist of both _ and __adrenoceptors; moreover, it induces norepinephrine release from sympathetic neurons, and thus is a sympatho_mimetic drug with a mixed profile. Caffeine increases both norepinephrine and dopamine release and stimulates the neuronal activity in several brain regions. In addition, caffeine antagonizes the inhibitory effects of adenosine on sympathetic nervous system (SNS). This modulation of SNS activity may be a possible explanation for the thermic effect of EC. In fact, epinephrine activates the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), a member of mitochondrial carriers localized on the inner mitochondrial membrane in brown adipocytes. The physiological role of UCP1 is to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation, therefore most of the energy is dissipated as heat rather than being converted to ATP. UCP1 is unique to brown adipocyte m tochondria, although brown_like multilocular adipocytes expressing UCP1 interspersed within human WAT have been observed. Actually, UCP1 mRNA has been detected in all adipose tissues in adult humans, and it has been estimated that 1 in 100_200 adipocytes in human intraperitoneal adipose tissue expresses UCP1. It has been shown that the cold_induced occurrence of brown_like adipocytes and UCP1 requires the presence of the _3_adrenoceptor in previously white adipose tissue and the presence of the _3_adrenoceptor is required for full stimulation of energy expenditure and oxygen consumption in white adipose tissue. In addition to UCP1, expressed exclusively in brown adipose tissue (BAT), another member of the mitochondrial anion carrier protein family i.e. uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) could play a physiological role in energy homeostasis. It is expressed almost exclusively in skeletal muscle and exhibits two transcriptional isoforms: a long form (UCP3L) and a short form (UCP3S). A brief caloric restriction resulted in"
Nct	"Effect of Morphine, Tramadol, and Ketorolac on Postoperative Stress and Immune Responses"	2015		CN-01552250	"Sixty patients aged (20_60 years), weighting (50 _75 Kg), with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I or II scheduled for modified radical mastectomy surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled in this prospective clinical study. The Ethics Committee of South Egypt Cancer Institute (SECI), assuit University, assuit, Egypt approved the study. Informed written consent was obtained from each patient to be enrolled in this study. Patients with known allergy to opioids or Non Steroidal Anti_inflammatory drugs NSAIDs, with gastric or duodenal ulcer, on radiotherapy or chemotherapy, received blood transfusion before the surgery or preoperative NSAIDs, steroid or opioid medications 48 hours prior to operation were excluded. All patients were taught how to evaluate their own pain intensity using the visual analogue scale (VAS) scored from 0 to 10 (where 0 = no pain and 10 = the worst pain imaginable). Both the patient and the anesthetist involved in the study were kept blinded to group assignment. Randomization codes were not decoded till the end. No pre_medications were given. Basic monitoring probes (ECG, non invasive blood pressure, end_tidal carbon dioxide, pulse oximetry and temperature) were applied. base line VAS, sedation score, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation were assessed before the beginning of surgery. Venous blood sample was taken for assessment of the base line stress hormones (cortisol, prolactin) and immune response (cluster of differentiation (CD) 3, 4, 8 and 56), General anesthesia was induced with I.V. fentanyl 1 _g/kg, thiopental 5mg/kg. Endotracheal intubation was facilitated by cis_atracurium 0.15 mg/kg, and was maintained with isoflurane 1.5_1.7 MAC, cis_atracurium 0.03 mg/kg and controlled ventilation in a ventilation parameters that maintain normocapnia (35_ 45 mmHg). Neuromuscular block was antagonized by neostigmine 50µg/kg and atropine 20µg/kg. Venous blood sample was taken for assessment of stress hormones (cortisol, prolactin) and immune response (CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD56) immediately postoperatively after extubation in the operative room before the analgesic drug administration. VAS, sedation score, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation were also assessed. Patients were allocated according to computer_generated randomization tables into one of three groups of 20 patients each to receive: Group I: (n=20) received IV 0.1mg/kg morphine sulphate (morphine sulfate ¨, Misr CO Pharma). Group II: (n=20) received IV 2 mg/kg tramadol Hcl (tramadol ¨, October Pharma S.A.E). Group III: (n=20) received IV 30 mg ketorolac tromethamine (ketorolac ¨, Amriya Pharma). Determination of serum cortisol and prolactin levels was done by fully automated ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) (EVOLIS¨, Biorad, Germany). Expressions of (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ and CD56+) in blood samples were measured as percentages of total lymphocytes by fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) calibur flow cytometry with cell quest software (Becton Dickinson Biosciences, USA). Anti_human IgG was used as an iso type_matched negative control for each sample. Forward and side scatter histogram was used to define the lymphocyte population. Then, the percentages of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ and CD56 were assessed in lymphocytes population. The positive percentage was >20% Patients were transferred to the post anesthesia care unit (PACU). During this period observation of heart rate, systolic and, diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and VAS were recorded at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18 and 24hrs postoperatively. In addition, side effect such as nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression and sedation (using sedation score from 0 to 4, where 0= awake, 1= easily aroused, 2= awaken after verbal stimulation, 3=awaken after tactile stimulation and 4= not arousable) were recorded and treated. Another venous blood samples were taken for assessment of stress hormones at 40 mins, imm ne response at 90 mins and for both stress hormones and immune responses at 24 hours later. In order to keep VAS ² 3 for 24hours postoperative, repeated doses of the same analgesic medications (morphine to the first group, tramadol to the second group, and ketorolac to the third group) were given all over the observation period at the same doses."
Nct	Perioperative Systemic Lidocaine for Enhanced Bowel Recovery After Bariatric Surgery	2015		CN-01553777	"Hypothesis Recognizing the need for enhanced bowel recovery for patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery, the investigators hypothesize that perioperative administration of low rather than high intravenous infusion rates of lidocaine can achieve early postoperative restoration of bowel motility at lower plasma levels. Up to the best of the investigators' knowledge there is no study addressed the effects of perioperative administration of systemic lidocaine on postoperative recovery of bowel function in morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric procedures. Aim of the study This trial aims to compare the effects of perioperative administration of escalating doses of intravenous lidocaine (1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mg/kg/h) on the perioperative changes in hemodynamic, pain scores, and plasma lidocaine concentrations, postoperative recovery of bowel function, cumulative morphine use, hospital length of stay, and lidocaine related adverse effects in obese patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgeries under general anesthesia. Randomization Five minutes before induction of general anesthesia, participants will be allocated randomly into four groups by drawing sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes containing a software_generated randomization code to receive an intravenous bolus of 0.1 mL/kg of either saline 0.9% or lidocaine 1.5% solution followed by a continuous infusion 0.1 mL/kg/h of Saline 0.9% or lidocaine 1%, 1.5% or 2% solution which will be continued for 24 hours after surgery. All medications in the study protocol will be based on the dosing body weight [ideal body weight (IBW) + 0.4 _ (actual body weight_IBW)]. All study solutions looked identical and will be prepared by a local pharmacy. All staff in the operating room will be unaware of patient allocation group. Perioperative management An independent anesthesiologist who will not be involved in the study will instruct the participants preoperatively about the use of patient controlled analgesia and visual analogue scale to assess the severity of postoperative pain (0 mm for no pain and100 mm for worst imaginable pain). Anesthetic management will be standardized. Oral ranitidine 150 mg and metoclopramide 10 mg will be administered the night before and 60 min before arrival in the operating room and subcutaneous enoxaparin 60 mg will be administered 12 h before the scheduled operation for prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis. Participant's monitoring includes electrocardiography, non_invasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry, plethysmography variability index (PVI) and capnography. Following pre_oxygenation, in all participants, anesthesia will be induced with fentanyl 2_3 ug/kg and propofol 1.5_2.5 mg/kg. Rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg will be administered to facilitate tracheal intubation. Anesthesia will be initially maintained with 0.7_1.2 minimum alveolar concentrations (MAC) of sevoflurane in combination with air (1 L/min) and oxygen (1 L/min) mixture to maintain the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) are ²20% of the baseline values. Fentanyl 0.5 ug/kg increments will be administered when the MAP and HR are ³20% of the baseline values despite a MAC of sevoflurane ³1.0. Rocuronium 0.1 mg/kg, will be used to maintain surgical relaxation. All operations will be performed by the same surgeons. During CO2 pneumoperitoneum, the intra_abdominal pressure will be maintained at 12_14 mm Hg. Participants position will be changed from supine to a 40¡ reverse Trendelenburg position. Blindness Statistical analysis: Power analysis and sample size calculation: Lungs will be initially ventilated in pressure_controlled mode to deliver a tidal volume of 8 ml/kg of predicted body weight (0.919 _ (height in cm _ 152.4) + 45.5 for women or 50 for men) at an I/E ratio of 1:2 and a positive end_expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. Respiratory rate will be adjusted to maintain end_tidal carbon dioxide tension (ETCO2) between 35 and 40 mm Hg. During the operation, intraoperative fluid management w s guided by a goal directed therapy algorithm using the PVI to guide fluid responsiveness. Hemodynamic control is standardized according to the investigators' protocol. Hypotension (defined as MAP value <25% of the baseline value on two consecutive readings within 3 min), not responding to decrease the sevoflurane MAC to 0.7 and a 5 ml/kg mL Ringer lactate or Acetate bolus over 5 min, will be treated with intravenous boluses of ephedrine, 3 mg or norepinephrine, 5 ug IV. Hypertension (defined as >20% increase in mean baseline MAP) will be treated by deepening anesthesia and administering doses of fentanyl, or labetalol, 20 mg. Tachycardia (defined as >20% increase in mean baseline HR) will be treated with esmolol, 20 mg. Bradycardia (HR <45) persisting for >2 min will be treated with glycopyrrolate, 0.2 mg IV, boluses. Intravenous ondansetron, 4 mg IV, will be given for all participants for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Before wound closure, bupivacaine 0.25% will be infiltrated at all portals, and residual neuromuscular block will be antagonized with neostigmine, 50 µg/kg IV, and glycopyrrolate, 10 µg/kg IV. After completing surgery, sevoflurane will be discontinued and infusion of study medication will be continued for 24 h after the wound closure. Times from discontinuation of sevoflurane to eye opening, obeying simple commands (e.g., open mouth, squeeze hand) and tracheal extubation will be recorded. Postoperative analgesic regime will be standardized in all participants including 30 mg of intravenous ketorolac every 6 h and paracetamol 1 g IV every 6 h and rescue doses of intravenous meperidine 25 mg. Participants will be discharged from the post_anesthesia care unit when they have a modified Aldrete score levels. Intravenous fluids will run at 40 mL/h on the night of surgery and will be discontinued 24 h after surgery. Little attention is paid to urine output or oliguria in the absence of abnormal vital signs. Strict parameters for fluid boluses the night of surgery are in place based on hypotension and tachycardia. Active bedside mobilisation will be enforced for the first time the evening after surgery and assisted ambulation the morning after surgery at least twice a day. Criteria for hospital discharge are as follows: absence of nausea and vomiting in the last 24 h, return of bowel function (daily defecation) and toleration of full diet, no to minimal pain (VAS less than 4), afebrile and no surgically associated morbidity (fever, wound dehiscence, wound infection, anastomotic leak, abscess). These variables will be recorded by a blind assessor to the allocation, every day at 10:00, 14:00 and 18:00 h. Patients ready for discharge after 14:00 h will be discharged on the following morning. All drains have to be removed before discharge. All staff in the operating room will be unaware of patient allocation group. Patients will be unaware about their allocation group. All study solutions looked identical and will be prepared by a local pharmacy. Caregivers: An independent anesthesiologist who will not be involved in the study will instruct the patients preoperatively about the use of patient controlled analgesia and visual analogue scale to assess the severity of postoperative pain (0 mm for no pain and100 mm for worst imaginable pain) and will give the anesthetics and will be instructed to avoid using local anesthetics. An independent investigator involved in the assessment of the data and participants will be blind to the group assignment. Data will be tested for normality using the KolmogorovSmirnov test. Repeated_measures analysis of variance will be used for serial changes in the continuous data at different times after administration of study solution and the differences will be then corrected by post_hoc Bonferroni correction test. Fisher's exact test will be used for categorical data. Kruskal_Wallis one_way ANOVA and post_hoc Wilcoxon rank sum t_tests will be used for comparisons of the non_continuous data. Categorical data will be expressed as number (%), ordinal data wi l be expressed as median [range] and continuous data will be expressed as mean ± SD. A value of P<0.05 is considered to represent statistical significance. Based on a previous study, the time to the return of bowel movements after laparoscopic bariatric surgery was normally distributed with a mean of 70 hours and a standard deviation of 22 hours. An a priori analysis indicated that 45 patients in each group would be sufficient to detect a 20% reduction in mean time to return of bowel movements, with a type I error of 0.005 (0.05/10 possible comparisons) and a power of 80%. The investigators added 15% more patients to account for drop_outs during the study."
Nct	Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibition and Narrow-band Ultraviolet-B Light in Psoriasis (DINUP)	2015		CN-02036092	"Background: Psoriasis is a chronic, autoimmune skin disease affecting approximately 2% of the world's population. It is characterised by keratinocyte hyperproliferation, by aberrant keratinocyte differentiation and by cutaneous inflammation. Dipeptidyl peptidase_4 (DPP_4) is expressed on keratinocytes and its activity is upregulated in psoriasis. DPP_4 inhibition suppresses keratinocyte proliferation and restores partially keratinocyte differentiation. The main site of DPP_4 activity is cluster of differentiation antigen 26 (CD26). CD26 is a marker of T cell activation and is a key molecule in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. One case of DPP_4 inhibitor therapy improving psoriasis severity has been reported. Agents used to treat psoriasis target commonly the underlying inflammation. C_reactive protein (CRP) is a sensitive, systemic marker of inflammation. In people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) DPP_4 inhibitor therapy decreases CRP concentrations. Serum CRP concentrations correlate with psoriasis severity and interventions that decrease the CRP concentration may decrease also psoriasis severity. Medications that improve insulin resistance may decrease also systemic inflammation and improve psoriasis. We have shown previously, in psoriasis patients without T2DM (both lean and obese), that the fasting insulin concentration and the homeostatic model of insulin resistance (measures of insulin resistance) correlate strongly with the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI, a measure of psoriasis severity: r=0.48, p<0.001; r=0.49, p<0.001). DPP_4 inhibitors prevent also the degradation of insulin secretagogues, such as glucagon_like peptide_1 (GLP_1), thereby ameliorating hyperglycaemia without causing hypoglycaemia. Due to this effect DPP_4 inhibitors are effective for the treatment of T2DM. Other interventions which increase GLP_1 receptor activation, such as roux_en_Y gastric bypass surgery and GLP_1 analogue therapy, can improve also psoriasis severity. We have reported previously a significant improvement in two patients with psoriasis and diabetes treated with the GLP_1 analogue liraglutide. In a subsequent open study of 7 patients with both psoriasis and type 2 diabetes we found a significant reduction in psoriasis severity and a significant improvement in quality of life following treatment with liraglutide. Name and Description of the Investigational Medicinal Products(s): Januvia¨ 100 mg tablets, which are film_coated tablets for oral ingestion that contain 100mg of the dipeptidyl peptidase_4 inhibitor sitagliptin. For research participants with moderate kidney disease (CrCl < 50 ml/min or eGFR < 50 ml/min/1.73m2), a dose of 50mg per day of sitagliptin will be used. Potential risks and benefits: More than 1% of people who take Januvia¨ tablets experience upper respiratory tract infection (no greater incidence than with placebo), hypoglycaemia (no greater incidence than with placebo), headache or limb pain. The potential benefits of DPP_4 inhibition include decreased risk of cardiovascular disease and decreased risk of bone fracture. The anticipated benefits of Januvia¨ therapy in psoriasis patients without type 2 diabetes thus justify the potential risks. Description of and justification for the route of administration, dosage, dosage regimen and treatment period: Study Hypothesis: Dipeptidyl peptidase_4 inhibitor therapy decreases psoriasis severity. Statement of Trial Conduct: Cohort: The population to be studied will be psoriasis patients with type 2 diabetes. Identification and Recruitment: Statistical Analysis Plan: Subgroup analyses will be performed on those research participants who: complete the visit 6 assessment; have severe psoriasis; have non_severe psoriasis; are male; are female; are obese; and are older than 45 years. This will be a two centre, thirty_nine week, prospective, randomized, open_label clinical trial of oral Januvia¨ (sitagliptin) tablets in 120 people with psoriasis without diabetes who are due to undergo a course of NB_UV phototherapy. After a three week run_in period, where research participants will not receive the investigational medicinal product, research participants will be allocated randomly, after stratification by centre, by HbA1c level (HbA1c < 38mmol/mol or ³ 38mmol/mol), BMI level (BMI < 30 kg/m2 or ³ 30 kg/m2) and previous response to NB_UVB (achieved remission within 25 exposures during most recent course of NBUVB or not) either to Arm A or to Arm B. Those who have not been exposed previously to NBUVB will be placed in the ""did not achieve remission within 25 exposures"" group. Research participants allocated to Arm A will receive a twenty six week supply of Januvia¨ tablets (DPP_4 Inhibitor) and will be instructed to ingest orally one 100mg tablet once daily (or 50mg once daily for participants with moderate kidney disease) for twenty four weeks. Research participants allocated to Arm B will receive no treatment (aside from usual medications and phototherapy). Both the research participants and the investigators will be aware of the trial arm to which the research participant has been allocated randomly (open_label study). Research participants will be prohibited from making any changes to the dose of medications used to treat psoriasis. Any other medications that are considered necessary for the participant's welfare and will not interfere with the study medication may be given at the discretion of the Investigator. Januvia¨ is licensed to improve glycaemic control for people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) states that the dose of Januvia¨ is 100mg once daily (using tablets for oral ingestion). For research participants with moderate kidney disease (CrCl < 50 ml/min or eGFR < 50 ml/min/1.73m2), the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) states that the dose of Januvia¨ is 50mg once daily (using tablets for oral ingestion). In keeping with this all participants with an eGFR < 50ml/min/1.73m2 who are due to receive Januvia¨ will receive 50mg once daily. This trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki (see Appendix 2), with the International Conference of Harmonisation Tripartite Guideline on Good Clinical Practice, with all applicable regulatory requirements and with data protection legislation (Data Protection Act 1988 and Data Protection Amendment Act 2003) We plan to enrol 120 research participants in total. Research participants will be recruited from two centres: St Vincent's University Hospital, Elm Park, Dublin 4 and Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Tallaght, Dublin 24. These hospitals provide outpatient dermatology services. Psoriasis patients attending these centres who have a psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) greater than 7 and who are due to undergo a course of NB_UVB phototherapy will be considered potentially eligible research participants and will be invited to attend for a screening visit. Potentially eligible research participants will be identified through use of patient databases in St Vincent's University Hospital and in Adelaide and Meath Hospital and through review of healthcare records in St Vincent's University Hospital and in Adelaide and Meath Hospital. Packaging and Labelling: The following assessments will then be performed: 1. Checking against inclusion and exclusion criteria; 2. Obtaining demographic information; 3. Obtaining a detailed medical history (previously diagnosed illnesses etc); 4. Obtaining a detailed medication history for the previous month; Potentially eligible research participants will be recruited in one of two ways by the study investigators or suitably qualified designee. One of these two ways will be during a clinic visit by the study investigators or suitably qualified designee. The other of the two ways will be mailing a letter of invitation. A record of all medication taken by study participants in the month before visit 1 and concomitant medication a participant takes throughout the study will be recorded on the appropriate page of the Case R port Form (CRF). Treatment compliance of research participants will be measured by pill counts. Research participants will be instructed to bring opened, unopened and empty investigational medicinal product packages to each visit in order to allow the assessment of compliance with study treatment. A record of all investigational medicinal product dispensed and returned will be documented on the investigational medicinal product dispensing and accountability log. Blood taken during stages when the participant is expected to be taking drug therapy will be used for future determination of plasma glucose and glycated haemoglobin concentrations. These concentrations will also be used to help ascertain compliance with the allocated treatment regimen. Blood samples for measurement of laboratory parameters will be taken between the hours of 0800 and 1200 after a greater than 12 hour overnight fast (with the exception of the Screening Visit when participants can attend in a non fasting state) and before ingestion of the study investigational medicinal product. The blood will be taken by a senior clinician, or suitably qualified designee, with competence and experience in the procedure of venepuncture. Thirty millilitres (30ml) of blood will be drawn during visit 1, and 73.5 ml during visit 2. Sixty millilitres (60ml) of blood will be drawn from the research participants during visits 3 to 5, and at visit 7. During visits 6 and 8, 67.5 mls of blood will be drawn.Blood will be drawn into vacutainer tubes containing either ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), lithium heparin, sodium fluoride, clot activator or a DPP_4 inhibitor cocktail. Each research participant will be asked to give a blood sample for genetic analysis at the 2nd Visit. These genetic samples will be analysed to try determine the genetic, and/or epigenetic, profile that predicts best response to DPP_4 inhibitor therapy. Whole blood will be stored for future DNA extraction using the protocols detailed in the Molecular Medicine Ireland Guideline for Standardised Biobanking (First Edition 2010). This involves drawing blood into a blood tube containing EDTA and storing the blood tube at _20¡C in secure, dedicated freezers in the Research Laboratories in the Education and Research Centre in St Vincent's University Hospital. The blood will be stored within 12 hours of blood collection. Blood that has been stored for future DNA extraction will be destroyed once the DNA analyses are complete. Disposal of this material will be in accordance with current practice in this unit and with the written protocols in place in this unit. Disposal will involve the use of solid plastic waste containers which will be sent for incineration. 5. Measurement of weight, blood pressure and heart rate; 6. Performing a urine based pregnancy test (women of child bearing potential only); 7. Assessment of PASI; and 8. Blood sampling for laboratory examination. Baseline (Visit 2, Day 0) The potential research participant will return for the baseline visit within three weeks of the screening visit. The following assessments will be performed: 2. Recording of adverse events; 3. Recording of changes in concomitant medication; 4. Measurement of height, weight, blood pressure and heart rate; To protect the research participant's identity, a unique identification code will be assigned by the Investigator, or authorised designee, to each participant's genetic sample and used in lieu of the participant's name. This coded form of identification, instead of the participant's name, will appear on all documents/databases. Demographic and baseline clinical data will be summarized using descriptive statistics by treatment group. Similarly, the primary and secondary efficacy variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics by treatment group. Data from research participants who are not allocated to either arm of the study and who do not receive a supply of the investigational medicinal product will be excluded from statistical analyses. T tests (or the appropriate alternative for non_parametri data), using two_sided tests, will be used to test for significant differences between the sets of data obtained. The independent samples T test will be used to assess for differences between the effects of the test product (Januvia¨) compared to the effects of no additional treatment. Chi square analyses will be used to test for significant differences in categorical variables between the sets of data obtained. All study medication will be labelled and stored in accordance with Annex 13 of the EU guidelines of good manufacturing practice in respect of investigational medicinal products for human use, the SPC and hospital procedures. Screening visit (Visit 1, Week _3) Before any screening examinations take place potentially eligible research participants will be given a full explanation as to what participation in the study would involve _ this will be done both verbally and in writing in the form of a written participant information leaflet. Potential research participants will be given sufficient time to consider their participation in the study and to ask any questions concerning the study. Potential research participants who are willing to take part in the study will be asked then to sign an informed consent form. No study related procedures will take place for any research participant before the informed consent form has been signed. An identification number will be allocated to the potential research participant following informed consent and provided that he or she meets the inclusion criteria and does not have an exclusion criterion to study entry. This identification number, together with the participant's initials, will act as a unique identifier for that participant. 1. Completion of quality of life questionnaires by the research participant (Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI); EuroQol five item questionnaire (EQ_5D); Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); and Stanford HAQ 8_Item Disability Scale (HAQ_8) ; 5. Performing a urine based pregnancy test (women of child bearing potential only); 6. Assessment of PASI; and 7. Blood sampling for laboratory examination. If the participant is willing a skin biopsy will be performed, using a sterile technique by an experienced physician, to determine skin immune cell number and skin pro_inflammatory protein level. If a participant is noted to score greater than 8 (out of 21) on either the anxiety or the depression components of the HADS, at this or any subsequent study visits, their General Practitioner (GP) will be advised of this and of the high likelihood of depressive/affective mental illness which may require treatment. The investigator, or authorised designee, will allocate then the research participant to a trial treatment arm using one of sixteen (8 per centre) prepared randomisation lists. 4. Measurement of weight, blood pressure and heart rate; 5. Performing a urine based pregnancy test (women of child bearing potential only); The investigator, or authorised designee, will chose the appropriate list based on the participant's centre, HbA1c level (HbA1c < 38mmol/mol or ³ 38mmol/mol), BMI level (BMI < 30 kg/m2 or ³ 30kg/m2) and previous response to NB_UVB (achieved remission within 25 exposures during most recent course of NBUVB or not). Those who have not been exposed previously to NBUVB will be placed in the ""did not achieve remission within 25 exposures"" group. For research participants allocated randomly to treatment arm A the investigator, or authorised designee, will ask the participant to bring back all used and unused Januvia¨ tablet packages at each study visit to enable a pill compliance check to be performed. 1st Treatment visit (Visit 3, Week 3 +/_ 7 days) The following assessments will be performed: 1.

Assessment of study drug compliance (pill count); 5. Measurement of weight, blood pressure and heart rate; 6. Assessment of PASI; and 7. Blood sampling for laboratory examination. If the participant is willing, and had a skin biopsy performed during visit 2, a skin biopsy will be performed, using sterile technique by an experienced physician, to determine skin immune cell number and skin pro_inflammatory protein level. 1st Follow_Up visit (Visit 7, Week 30 +/_ 7 days) The following assessments will be performed: 1. Completion of quality of life questionnaires by the research participant as detailed in Baseline Visit above; 2. Recording of adverse events; 3. Recording of changes in concomitant medication; 4. Measurement of weight, blood pressure and heart rate; 5. Assessment of PASI; and 6. Blood sampling for laboratory examination. End of Study visit (Visit 8, Week 36 +/_ 7 days) The following assessments will be performed: 1. Completion of quality of life questionnaires by the research participant as detailed in Baseline Visit above; 2. Recording of adverse events; 3. Recording of changes in concomitant medication; 6. Assessment of PASI; and 7. Blood sampling for laboratory examination. Early Withdrawal visit: All research participants who withdraw early from the study will be advised to agree to attend an early withdrawal visit. There will be a separate section in the CRF to be completed if the research participant withdraws early from the study before week 36. The following assessments will be performed: 1. Completion of quality of life questionnaires by the research participant as detailed in Baseline Visit above; 2. Recording of adverse events; 3. Recording of changes in concomitant medication; 4. Assessment of study drug compliance (pill count) if appropriate; 5. Measurement of weight, blood pressure and heart rate; 6. Performing a urine based pregnancy test (women of child bearing potential only); 7. Assessment of PASI; and 8. Blood sampling for laboratory parameters. The research participant's involvement in this study will end following the completion of the End of Study Visit (or Early Withdrawal visit if applicable). Once participants have completed their involvement in this study they will be provided with standard treatment by their usual healthcare providers. Adverse Events: Comprehensive assessments of any apparent toxicity experienced by the research participant will be performed throughout the course of the study from the time of participant's signature of informed consent. Adverse events (AEs) considered related to Study Drug at the End of Study Visit (or Early Withdrawal Visit, if applicable) will be followed until the participant is stable or the AE is resolved or the participant is lost to follow_up. Any medical c ndition, or clinically significant laboratory abnormality with an onset date before the Baseline Visit and not related to a protocol_associated procedure, is not an AE. It will be considered to be pre_existing. Complete and appropriate data on all Adverse Events experienced (observed, volunteered or elicited) during the reporting period will be reported on an ongoing basis in the Adverse Event Form pages of the Case Report Form. The investigator will classify the severity of an adverse event. The investigator will systematically assess the relationship of the adverse event to the investigational medicinal product. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Information about all SAEs will be collected and recorded on the SAE Report Form. Each SAE must be reported by the Investigator, or an authorised designee, to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. Medical and scientific judgement will be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life_threatening or result in death or hospitalisation, but may jeopardise the research participant or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These will be considered also serious. Justification of Population and Method of Estimation: We plan to enrol 120 research participants in total in the two sites. The primary objective of the research project is to determine the change in the psoriasis area and severity index (_PASI) during twenty four weeks of treatment with a dipeptidyl peptidase_4 inhibitor (Januvia¨, 100mg daily or 50mg daily for participants with moderate kidney disease) in psoriasis patients undergoing narrow_band ultraviolet_B (NB_UVB) light therapy. This will be compared to the _PASI of psoriasis patients undergoing NB_UVB light therapy who are allocated randomly to not receive any additional treatment. Method of Randomisation: Januvia¨ tablets; OR No additional treatment. In order to achieve this we have prepared 8 randomisation lists using a web_based random generator programme. One copy of this document will be used for each centre. Kleinpenning et al have determined previously the effect of two different NB_UVB light therapy regimens on the decrease in PASI three months after completion of a course of NB_UVB light therapy. Three months after cessation of NB_UVB light therapy the decrease in the PASI in those receiving an high_dose regimen was 5.93±4.1compared to baseline. This decrease in PASI was significantly less in the group receiving a low_dose regimen (4.14±2.96, p<0.05). Based on these data, and assuming a 33% dropout rate, we have calculated that we will require 60 research participants (in each arm) to detect a greater than 33% difference in the _PASI with 80% power and a 5% significance level. The unit of randomisation will be the individual research participant. After stratification by centre, by HbA1c level (HbA1c < 38mmol/mol or ³ 38mmol/mol), BMI level (BMI < 30 kg/m2 or ³ 30 kg/m2) and previous response to NB_UVB (achieved remission within 25 exposures during most recent course of NBUVB or not) 120 research participants will be assigned randomly, in a ratio of 1:1 using blocks of 2, to receive either: For each participant the investigator, or authorised designee, will chose the appropriate list and will add the participant's identifier to the list in chronological order. This list will be thereby used to determine the study treatment which the participant will receive. Random allocation will occur at visit 2 (baseline visit) once all screening procedures required at visit 1 (screening visit) have been completed, once it has been confirmed that the participant satisfies all inclusion and exclusion criteria and once the participant completes the three week run_in period. Identification numbers will be assigned chronologically in consecutive, ascending order. Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval: Before in tiating this study the Study Protocol, Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC), Patient Information Leaflet and Informed Consent Form, applicable advertising, and any other written information to be given to participants will be reviewed and approved by a properly constituted Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC/IRB). A signed and dated statement that all documents submitted for review have been approved by the IEC/IRB will be given to the Sponsor or designee before the study can commence at a site. The membership and the constitution of the IEC/IRB who approved the documents will be also supplied to the Sponsor or designee. Ethical Conduct of the Study: This study will be carried out in compliance with the Study Protocol and in accordance with the Sponsor/Contract Research Organisations (CROs) Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). These are designed to ensure adherence to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, as described in: International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice 1996.

Nct	EndoBarrier TM Gastrointestinal Liner Diabetes Trial	2015		CN-01590273	"The management of obesity is challenging and obesity surgery is by far the most effective treatment currently available. Recent medical research indicates that it also improves the management of blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes. Obesity surgery carries different risks and benefits and it is important to balance these by choosing the right procedure for each patient. Therefore new effective strategies to prevent and reduce obesity and its complications such as type 2 diabetes mellitus are needed. This study is designed to see whether a new device called the EndoBarrier Gastrointestinal Liner helps patients manage their blood sugar levels and lose weight. It is a randomised, placebo controlled trial which compares the potential of the EndoBarrier device with conventional drug therapy, diet and exercise for obesity related type 2 diabetes, and their effectiveness on metabolic state (HbA1c reduced by 20% and blood pressure below 135/85), weight loss, and quality of life. It will further evaluate whether any other conditions that may be related to obesity could become less severe and collect information about complications to determine the safety of the device. The study will also perform various measurements and tests to understand the underlying mechanism of the device. After an initial screening visit to determine patients eligibility, they will be invited for 14 subsequent visits. Patients will be randomised into either having the EndoBarrier device or standard medical therapy treatment for 12 months followed by another 12 months follow_up period. They will also be routinely seen by specialist dietitian who will provide dietetic support throughout the study."
Nct	Celiac Plexus Block for Chronic Pancreatitis RCT	2015		CN-01505284	"1.0 Background and Hypothesis: Chronic pancreatitis is an inflammatory disease of the pancreas characterized by painful scarring and loss of glandular function.The prevalence of chronic pancreatitis in the United States is estimated to be 0.2 to 5% and results in 86,000 hospitalizations. The majority of patients with chronic pancreatitis will develop significant abdominal pain which is debilitating and results in a significant burden on the health care system. Multiple approaches, including pancreatic enzymes, narcotic analgesia, celiac plexus block and surgical ganglionectomy have been used to treat pancreatic pain with variable success. Injection of local anesthesia agents and steroids into the celiac plexus for pain control has been used for many years via both surgical and percutaneous approaches. Topical therapy theoretically prevents the conduction of painful stimuli from the pancreas and addresses inflammatory changes in the afferent nerves themselves. Splanchnic nerves pass from the pancreas to the thoracic root ganglia via the celiac ganglia which are the target for intervention. Nerve changes in chronic pancreatitis including perineural inflammation, altered diameter, and upregulation of pain neuropeptides (including Substance P) are associated with increased sensitivity to stimuli from the pancreas (distension and inflammation) as well as pain independent of stimuli (neuropathic). Endoscopic ultrasound allows for close proximity, high resolution assessment of the gastrointestinal tract wall and adjacent anatomic structures. Physicians are able to perform EUS_guided celiac plexus injections in the outpatient setting under conscious sedation. The EUS guided approach offers better visualization of the celiac region and direct access to the celiac plexus. EUS guided celiac plexus block is a core part of the routine care of patients at Los Angeles County Hospital with chronic pancreatitis. Celiac plexus block is a recommendation for refractory chronic pancreatitis pain by the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE). These modest improvement for celiac block for chronic pancreatitis (especially in comparison to celiac plexus neurolysis in pancreas cancer) have led some investigators to question whether EUS guided celiac plexus block is an effective treatment for chronic pancreatitis pain despite its routine use. Prospective randomized controlled studies examining the efficacy of endoscopic ultrasound guided celiac plexus block are lacking. 2.0 Objectives and Purpose Our aim is to perform a pilot randomized trial to gauge the degree to which celiac plexus block performed under endoscopic ultrasound guidance will benefit patients with chronic pancreatitis. We will assess whether celiac plexus block significantly decreases pain scores, hospitalization, and pain medication requirements and increases the ability to return to normal activities. 3.0 Study Design Patients presenting to the Los Angeles County Medical Center and Gastroenterology Clinic with chronic upper abdominal pain are the focus population of this study. Patients who are undergoing endoscopic ultrasound for standard clinical care to assess for chronic pancreatitis will be enrolled. They must have a M_ANNHEIM severity score of 6 or greater. Additionally, they must have at least intermittent if not chronic pain of intensity >3 on the visual analogue scale requiring opiate medication. 4.1 Side effects/Toxicities to be monitored: 4.12 Long term toxicities to be monitored after completion of the celiac block during the 6 months the patients are followed. 4.2 Dosage changed based on toxicity There will be no dosage adjustments as the procedure will be performed once during the study period. 4.32 Places for submitting reports: Adverse events will be reported to the IRB and data safety monitoring committee. Several studies have shown that EUS_guided CPB has a beneficial role in treating pain caused by chronic pancreatitis. A randomized trial by Gress et al looked at the efficacy of EUS_guided versus CT_guided celiac plexus block for controlling abdominal pain of chronic pancreatitis in 18 patients. They found significant improvement in pain symptoms in patients randomized to EUS_guided celiac plexus block over a mean time period of 10 weeks. A study by the same group showed an improvement in overall pain score in 55% at 4 and 8 weeks of follow_up in 90 patients. Adverse events including diarrhea and infection occurred in 3%. A comprehensive review by Kaufman et al in 2010 evaluated the efficacy of EUS_guided celiac plexus block and celiac plexus neurolysis in alleviating chronic abdominal pain due to chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer respectively. A total of 6 studies were included in their analysis, comprising 221 patients, and found that EUS_guided celiac plexus block was effective in 51.46% of patients with chronic pancreatitis. EUS_guided celiac plexus neurolysis (with alcohol) was effective in 72.54% of those with pancreas cancer. The procedures will be performed by experienced endosonographers. The EUS_guided celiac plexus block will be performed under the guidance of linear array endosonography. A visual exam will first be performed with the EUS scope or a standard endoscope. Patients found to have a significant peptic ulcer or other mucosal abnormality will be excluded as the symptoms may be secondary to peptic disease. An EUS exam will then be performed to determine whether the patient has findings of chronic pancreatitis. The diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis will be confirmed based on EUS criteria (meeting four or more criteria of hyperechoic foci, hyperechoic strands, lobularity, cysts, stones, dilation of the main pancreatic duct, irregular pancreatic_duct margins, presence of side branches and hyperechoic pancreatic duct_margins). Those who are confirmed to have chronic pancreatitis will be randomized (1:1) during the procedure to celiac plexus block versus no injection treatment. Randomization will be performed using a computer program with concealed allocation. The research coordinator obtaining data for follow up visits and the patient will be blinded to randomization. The endosonographer will not be blinded. Ninety patients will be enrolled (see statistical considerations for sample size calculation). Those randomized to control will undergo EUS and confirmation of chronic pancreatitis but not celiac plexus block. Patients in the treatment group will receive celiac plexus block with 10mL 0.25% bupivacaine and 2ml (40mg/cc) triamcinolone which are the standard doses. The 22 gauge needle will be inserted into the base of the celiac plexus via the transgastric approach and a single injection will be performed. An intravenous antibiotic will be administered at the time of the block to those in the celiac plexus block group with the specific agent depending on the patient's allergy profile. The research coordinator obtaining data for follow up visits and the patient will be blinded to the details of the block (or lack thereof) procedure but it will be recorded. Following the procedure standard recovery room monitoring including assessment of blood pressure be performed for 2 hours for both groups. Periprocedural fluid and antibiotic use for celiac plexus block is not standardized and will be at the discretion of the endoscopist performing the cases. Patients will be assessed before the procedure, immediately afterward, and at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months following the procedure. At the initial assessment and follow up visits Visual analogue pain scores will be recorded as well as an assessment of the ability to work and conduct activities of daily living. Pain medication requirements and whether symptoms are alleviated by analgesic or disrupt sleep will be noted. The M_ANNHEIM scoring system will be used to gauge symptoms as well. Additionally, patients will complete a focused version of the online CarePrep Program during each visit. The Online CarePrep (OCA) program is used to clinically evaluate patients with complex symptoms or conditions generally characterized significant physical symptoms, ps chosocial issues, impaired quality_of_life and functional status, disability, and substance abuse. It has an online format that has been successfully used by outpatient with various gastrointestinal illness to report multifactorial symptoms. When performed prior to appointments it appears to facilitate efficient and productive medical visits. 4.11 Three most common complications from celiac plexus block include hypotension, transient diarrhea, transient increase in pain. Extraordinarily rare/theoretical complications include paralysis, pneumothorax, loss of sphincter function, retroperitoneal bleeding, renal puncture and prolonged gastroparesis. 4.3 Adverse Event Reporting: 4.31 Type of event to be reported and timing of reports. If patients develop adverse events including hypotension, transient diarrhea, transient increase in pain, or less common complications of unilateral paresis or paraplegia, pneumothorax, loss of sphincter function, retroperitoneal bleeding, renal puncture, prolonged gastroparesis or infection, this will be reported to the principal investigators and will be reviewed by the study team as well as two staff physicians in the gastroenterology division who are not part of the study team. This will also be reported to the IRB. If patients experience any further events that are detected during follow up these will be coded as A) related to study or B) not related to study. Their severity and A) whether they were expected or B) not expected will also be recorded. These complications will also be reported to the principal investigators and will be reviewed by the study team as well as two staff physicians in the gastroenterology division who are not party of the study team. They will also be reported to the IRB. 4.4 Data Monitoring Committee: The data safety monitoring committee will include the principal investigators from medicine/gastroenterology as well as the entire study team. Two outside senior physician from gastroenterology or surgery will also be asked to participate. Meetings will be convened if adverse events potentially related to the celiac block occur. 5.0 Statistical Considerations Descriptive statistics will be performed for each group, and comparisons made to determine if the groups are balanced on the stratification factor of type of pancreatitis. Patient characteristics will be compared between groups as well to determine if there is imbalance of other possible covariates. We expect that there will be patients with chronic pancreatitis secondary to congenital abnormalities of the pancreatic duct, ethanol abuse, familial, and idiopathic etiologies. The sample size of 90 patients was chosen based on preliminary sample size calculations. Based on recent studies 30% of patients with pancreatitis type pain in the placebo arm will derive benefit.16 The predicted response rate of 51.5% for EUS guided celiac block was based on the large review by Kaufmann et al. For a 2 sided alpha of 0.05 and a power of 0.80, 83 patients would be necessary to show a difference. Statistical analyses will be performed by biostatisticians at the Biostatistical and Bioinformatics Resource Group within the SC CTSI."
Nct	A Clinical Trial Analyzing Effects of Prokinetic Drug on the Blood Glucose in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes	2015		CN-01553751	"With the improvement of living level, the incidence rates of diabetes, obesity, and hypertension in China increased quickly, which are 11.6%, 7.1% and 18.8% respectively, according to the newly investigated data. The clustering of diabetes, obesity, hypertension and dyslipidemia increases the risk of cardiovascular events for patients. GLP_1 (glucagon like peptide_1) is a kind of incretin discovered in recent years. It was reported that beside its hypoglycemic and losing weight effects, activator of GLP_1 receptor could decrease blood pressure and improve lipid metabolism. Sleeve gastrectomy can improve the level of blood glucose and serum lipid of type 2 diabetic rats by ameliorate insulin level and insulin resistance, which may be related with the change of gastrointestinal hormones such as ghrelin and GLP_1. So, intervention of gastrointestinal tract and gastrointestinal hormone secretion may be a new therapy for glycolipids disorder and vascular complications. But, it is lack of evidence_based medicine proof on the relationship between prokinetic drug and glycolipids metabolism. So, the investigators designed a prospective, randomized, double_blinded, placebo control study, and try to evaluate the effects of prokinetic drug (Mosapride) on the blood glucose and serum lipid in type 2 diabetic patients."
Nct	Efficacy of Ketamine Added to Local Anesthetic in Modified Pectoral Block for Management of Postoperative Pain	2015		CN-02031603	"This randomized Clinical trial was approved by the ethics committee of South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assuit University, Assuit, Egypt. Sixty patients aged 18 _ 60 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I_II, with body weight of 50 _ 90 kg and arranged for modified radical mastectomy) were enrolled in this study. Patients with a history of bleeding diathesis, relevant drug allergy, opioid dependence, morbid obesity, sepsis, prior surgery in the supraclavicular, infraclavicular or axillary regions, alcohol or drug abuse and those with psychiatric illnesses that would interfere with perception and assessment of pain were excluded from the study. Preoperatively, patients were taught how to evaluate their own pain intensity using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), scored from 0_10 (where 0= no pain and 10=worst pain imaginable), and whenever (during the follow up period) VAS points to a value ³ 3. Analgesia comprised PCA with an initial morphine bolus of 0.1mg/kg once pain expressed by the patient or if VAS ³ 3 followed by 1mg boluses with a lockout period a 5 minute. The time to first request for analgesia and the total analgesic consumption in the first 24 hours were recorded. On arrival to the operating room, an intravenous line was inserted. Monitoring included electrocardiography (ECG), non_invasive blood pressure (NIBP), arterial oxygen saturation (Sao2) and end_tidal carbon_ dioxide were applied. Anesthesia was induced for all participating patients with 2 _g/kg fentanyl, 2_3 mg/kg propofol and 1.5 mg/kg lidocaine. Endotracheal intubation was facilitated by 0.15 mg/kg cis_atracurium. Anesthesia was maintained by 1_1.5 MAC isoflurane in 50% oxygen / air mixture and 0.03 mg/kg cisatrcurium respectively in ventilation parameters to maintain on ETco2 of approximately 35_ 40 mmHg. Ultrasound guided pecs block then performed Patients were randomly assigned into 2 groups (using a randomization_computer program), 30 patients in each: Group I (Bupivacaine group): patients were given ultrasound guided, modified Pecs block with 30 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine divided into 10 ml injected between the two pectoralis muscles on the interfascial plane, and 20 ml injected between the Pectoralis minor muscle and the serratus muscle. Group II (Bupivacaine + ketamine group) : patients were given ultrasound guided, modified Pecs block with 30 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine plus ketamine (1 mg/kg) divided into 10 ml injected between the two pectoralis muscles on the interfascial plane , and 20 ml injected between the Pectoralis minor muscle and the serratus muscle. Modified Pecs block was performed under general anesthesia, and 15 min. before skin incision. We performed the modified Pecs block or the "" Pecs II block"" by using a two needle approach instead of one. The first puncture is a Pecs I block with 10 ml of local anesthetic injected between the two pectoralis muscles, and the second puncture injects 20 ml of local anesthetic between the Pectoralis minor muscle and the serratus muscle. This breaks through the 'axillary door' and will reach the long thoracic nerve and reliably at least two intercostal nerves. We used a broadband linear array probe, with an imaging depth of 3_4cm. starting from the lateral third of the clavicle and moving distally and laterally to the mid axillary line. At the end of surgery, reversal of muscle relaxant was done using neostigmine (0.04 mg/kg) and atropine (0.01 mg/kg). After extubation; all patients were transmitted to post anesthesia care unit (PACU). Each patient in both groups was followed up and assessed at baseline, 1h, 2h, 4h, 6h , 12h , 24h, 48h postoperatively for: Vital signs (The patients' heart rate, non invasive arterial blood pressure, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation), Post operative pain where the severity of pain was assessed using VAS score, the time to first request of rescue analgesia and total morphine consumption in the 48 hours. Potential side effects, including, sedation by sedation score of 0_4 (0 = patient fully awake; 1 = patient s mnolent and responsive to verbal commands; 2 = patient somnolent and responsive to tactile stimulation; and 3 = patient asleep and responsive to painful stimulation; 4 = not arousable), chest pain, nausea, vomiting (treated by IV boluses of metochlopromide 10 mg), and psychological complications (hallucination, delirium, dreams, nystagmus, dissociative effects) were also recorded."
Nct	Preventing Atopic Dermatitis and ALLergies in Children	2015		CN-02046509	"The PreventADALL study is a long term prospective birth cohort study, with an intervention aspect designed as a randomized clinical trial (RCT), and an exploratory aspect, enrolling mother_child pairs by including pregnant women, allowing for intrauterine investigations of the baby and maternal factors during pregnancy, and thereafter including their new_born babies for long_term follow_up investigations. With the knowledge that allergic diseases often manifest in early infancy, interventions will be carried out as early as possible to investigate if allergic diseases can be prevented. Two interventions, early and systematic introduction to common foods, and early skin care are carried out within the first four months and the first nine months of life, respectively. Inclusion/Exclusion criteria: Ante_natal inclusion, step 1: All mothers to_be at 18 weeks ultrasound investigation with sufficient language skills (Norwegian or Swedish), gestational age: at least 16_22 weeks. Exclusion: Plans to move further than reasonable travel distance from any of the participating hospitals within the first year of the offspring's life. Inclusion of the child, step 2: Live_born babies of gestational age 35.0 weeks or more (including multiple pregnancies), maternal/parental willingness to participate in the study Exclusion criteria child: 1) severe neonatal cardiac, pulmonary, neurological, dermatological disease or other disease that may influence the outcomes 2), plans to move further than reasonable travel distance away from any of the participating hospitals within the first nine months of life. 3) Non_willingness to participate 4) More than two fetuses Overall design: A multi_national population_based prospective birth cohort with a factorial designed randomized controlled intervention trial of two clinical interventions; skin care 0_9 months and early food introduction by 3_4 months continuing to at least 6 moths and preferentially continuing thereafter. Observation only after nine months of age. Recruitment is done in two steps; first pregnant women at the 18_weeks ultrasound investigation and thereafter their new_born babies. Randomisation into four groups is done by the postal code or ""township"" to ensure all four intervention_groups within each ""township"". Electronic questionnaires will be completed by the mother at 18 and 34 weeks gestation, as well as for the baby at 3_6_9_12_18_24_30_36 months and annually thereafter. Also, an electronic diary will be completed each week from 2_26 weeks of age, to register weekly interventions, as well as symptoms of allergic diseases and food intake. Visits for biological and environmental sampling, observations and investigations will be at the relevant pediatric departments (at 3_6_12_24_36 months of age) and annually thereafter. It is a hope that the study can be maintained well into adulthood. The study will be run in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP). Investigations: Clinical investigations and biological sampling focuses on: General development, clinical assessments of health or disease, as well as diagnosing allergic disease and later also other non_communicable diseases (NCD)s. These include: _ Fetal growth and respiratory development _ Somatic growth and status (anthropometric data) _ Blood pressure _ Skin, respiratory, gastrointestinal and other relevant organs _ Skin barrier (trans epidermal water loss (TEWL)) _ Lung function and _development _ Microbiota/diversity (in and on the body and the environment) _ Viral infections _ Immune_deviation/tolerance development _ Specific allergen antibodies (IgE/IgG) _ Xenobiotics and interactions between exposures (microbiota/xenobiotics) _ Genetics/epi_genetics Outcome measures: Primary outcomes from birth to assessment times, first at 12 months of age for AD and at 36 months for food allergy to intervention allergens: 1. Atopic dermatitis (AD), Food allergy to any intervention allergen 2. Allergic sensitization (yes/no as well as quant tative, by skin prick test and s_IgE) Secondary outcomes: annually (ie 12, 24, 36, months and further follow_up investigations through childhood into adulthood): asthma (bronchial obstruction in year 1_2) and/or food allergy to any other allergen and/or anaphylaxis and/or allergic rhinitis Later outcomes for the exploratory part of the study will be defined in terms of obesity, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. For assessments of food allergy, first determined at three years of age, we will harmonize study protocols with similar studies. Interventions: Skin intervention (IS): Skin care is performed from week 2 through 8 months of age, supervised by study personnel prior to leaving the hospital. Food intervention (IF): Major food allergens (cow's milk, peanut, wheat, egg) are introduced no later than 4.0 months of age as tastes, not interfering with nutrition. Safety assessment: An external surveying committee to assess adverse events and main outcomes will be established prior to study start, to assess safety and potential needs for re_assessing interventions. The safety committee is offered free access to any data they need, at their discretion. Statistical approaches: Stratum randomization, logistic regression analyses (primary outcomes), mixed models (continuous outcomes particularly of allergic sensitization by quantification) will be applied. An external surveillance committee will monitor the safety aspects with availability to reports whenever, and whatever clinical or other criteria they deem appropriate. Their assessment will have the potential to stop the trial in case of large differences in the groups. However, due to the short time span of observation before the interventions are completed, it is unlikely that intervention differences may be observed prior to completion. Power analysis lack underlying data and is therefore based upon the prevalence Environment and Childhood Asthma study (ECA study) of AD at two years of age for skin barrier intervention only. The prevalence (%) of (ever) allergic disease in the ECA study were at 2, 10 and 16 years of age: Asthma: 8 (recurrent bronchial obstruction), 20 and 26.4%, Atopic eczema: 23.2, 33.2 and 34.8%, Allergic rhinitis (10 and 16 years): 19 and 32.1%, Allergic sensitization (10/16 years): 37.4 and 52.6%, respectively. Data on food allergy is lacking. The investigators' pilot study suggested a prevalence reduction in AD from 16 to four % at 6_months of age in children with dry skin subjected to skin care from 2 weeks. Thus, an estimated reduction from 23.2 % to 18.2 % (five per cent points) in a general population would be highly clinically relevant, worthwhile and feasible and require 1030 children in each skin care versus observation group to attain an 80 % power at 5% significance level. A reduction to 19.2 % (four per cent points) requires 1638 children per group. In line with emerging study results (2015) the power_estimates will be repeated with potential modification of population size requirement until the target population is recruited. Study Phases: Recent publications demonstrated approximately 30 % reduction in atopic dermatitis at 32 weeks of age after daily use of skin care and 50% risk reduction at 6 months of age in 124 high risk children, respectively suggesting that approx. 1000 babies in each group would be sufficient to detect significant and relevant reductions in AD in a factorially 2x2 designed study. With many sub_studies we aim for 2400_2500 mother_child pairs. The first phase of the PreventADALL study; to establish the birth cohort study, collect information and biological samples, closely assess the children in the first 3 years of life, assess the impact of the two interventions and the impact of microbiota and xenobiotic exposure on early allergic disease presentation. This phase will also create the foundation for a long_term follow_up study with careful assessments of potential risk or protective factors for allergic as well as other NCDs at the start of life. The PreventADALL study will lead to improved nowledge of the potential effect of primary prevention and of management of allergic diseases in early life as well as improving knowledge of risk factors for NCDs later in life."
Nct	Compare Between Two Doses of Palonosetron on the Prevention of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting in Obese Patients	2016		CN-01521770	"Prevention of nausea and vomiting after surgery is a routine throughout anesthetic_surgical procedure, since the discomfort and morbidity associated with this anesthetic complication are widely known. The serotonin antagonists are largely used for this purpose because they exhibit superior prophylactic efficacy when compared with other antiemetic drugs. Its mechanism of action is the inhibition of calcium influx caused by stimulation of serotonin 5_hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptor (5_HT3). Palonosetron is a second generation serotonin antagonist with high affinity binding to the 5_HT3 receptor. It has a unique chemical structure and longer half_life than older 5_HT3 antagonists. It was initially approved for use in the prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting but also proved effective in the prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Palonosetron is usually used in a Þxed dose of 75 mcg for the prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Although there are a few trials evaluating bodyweight_adjusted doses of palonosetron, the ideal dose of obese patient has not yet been investigated. Aims & Objectives: The hypothesis for this study is that the use of bodyweight_adjusted doses of palonosetron (1mcg / kg) is more effective than a fixed dose (75mcg) for preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting in female patients with a body mass index equal to or above 30 kg / m2 whom have undergone breast surgery. Methods: A prospective, randomized double_blind trial will be conducted at the National Cancer Institute (INCA _ HCIII), in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. All patients will be provided with written informed consent form prior to study enrolment. Using computer_generated random numbers, the patients will be assigned into one of the two treatment groups on the morning of surgery. Forty patients will be randomized to receive a fix dose of 75 _g of palonosetron (group I _ fix dose group) and another forty patients will receive a bodyweight_adjusted dose of 1mcg/kg of palonosetron (group II _ bodyweight_adjusted group). Each study drug will be mixed with saline to a total volume of 10 ml in an unlabelled syringe and will be intravenously administered just prior to induction of anesthesia. All patients, surgeons, anesthesiologists involved in the study will be blinded to group allocation to maintain the double_blind conditions. All episodes of nausea and vomiting will be recorded for 48h. Patients will be assessed over 3 time periods: 0_6 h, 6_26 h and 24_48 h after surgery. After discharge, all patients will be contacted by telephone at regular intervals to record the episodes of nausea and vomiting as well as analgesic and antiemetic requirements. The primary outcome measure will include the number of emetic episodes, the incidence of nausea, the need for rescue antiemetics and the analgesic requirement after 48h. Nausea is deÞned as a subjective unpleasant sensation associated with the urge to vomit without expulsion of gastric content and vomiting is deÞned as the forceful expulsion of gastric contents trough the mouth. The secondary outcome will be to evaluate the frequency of polymorphism of the 5_HT3 receptors and their correlation with the antiemetic effect and adverse effects. The patients will have cell samples of the oral cavity, collected through smear. The collected material will be placed in a tube and then will be stored at freezer. Then, it will be analyzed in the laboratory of Clinical Research Unit at the Federal Fluminense University (UFF). After extracting the DNA from the samples using a DNA purification kit, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) will be performed for analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms. Biological samples will be discarded at the end of the analysis. All patients will receive premedication with midazolam. Intraoperative monitoring included electrocardiography, blood pressure measurement, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), and end_tidal CO2 tension (ETco2). General anesthesia was induced using 1,5 mg/kg of propof l, 3 _g/kg of fentanyl, 1,5 mg/kg of lidocaine and 0.3 mg/kg of rocuronium. Then the insertion of laryngeal mask will be performed and the pulmonary ventilation will be maintained with 6 ml/kg of ideal_weight and maximum peak pressure 25 cmH2O. The anesthesia will be maintained with sevoflurane in 50% oxygen/air. Sevoflurane concentration was adjusted to ensure an equal depth of anesthesia during surgery as assessed by the bispectral index (BIS; BIS A_1050 Monitor, Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA, USA), which will be held between 40_60. Remifentanil will be administered for supplemental intraoperative analgesia and its dose will be adjusted to maintain blood pressure and heart rate within 20% of baseline values. At the end of surgery, residual neuromuscular blockade will be reversed with 2mg/kg of Sugammadex and the laryngeal mask will be removed. Patients will stay on the postanesthetic care unit for at least 1 hour before going to the ward. In the postoperative recovery room, the haemodynamic variables along with postoperative complications such as shivering, hypotension, dizziness, constipation or any other adverse reaction to the drug will be recorded by a blinded observer. After surgery, rescue medication will be intravenous metoclopramide (10 mg) for more than one episodes of nausea or vomiting. Sample size was calculated with reference to the results of a study comparing weight_adjusted doses of palonosetron for prevention of PONV in laparoscopic gynaecological surgery in no_obese patients. For a P value of 0.05 and a power of 0.8, a minimum of 36 per dose group was required. To allow for possible dropouts, the aim was to recruit 40 patients in each group. SPSS version 13.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL,USA) will be used for statistical analysis. The Shapiro_Wilk test will be use to ensure that data will be normally distributed. Patient characteristics and intra_ and post_operative variables will be analysed by two_tailed ANOVA. For nonparametric variables, Kruskal_Wallis test will be applied. Proportions will be compared using x2 square or Fisher's exact test. The dose_dependency effects of palonosetron will be assessed using the x2 trend test for proportions. A P value < 0.05 is considered statistically significant."
Nct	An Intensive Lifestyle Intervention Program in CKD (Move to Health 2)	2016		CN-01507014	"The study will be advertised at Renal and Transplant Associates of New England (RTANE) and interested patients will be screened and cleared by nephrologists from RTANE to make sure that they do not have any contraindications to exercise as described by the American College of Sports Medicine. Those patients who are eligible (stage 3_4, eGFRs 15_59 ml/min/1.73m2) to participate, and who want to be involved , will be asked to read and sign a consent form, which had been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Springfield College. This signing will take place at RTANE prior to coming to the College. Individuals will be randomly assigned to either the lifestyle intervention group or the usual care group. During the course of the study, serum potassium levels will be monitored on a monthly basis in all patients. For individuals randomized to the intervention group, if their levels are greater than 5.2 mEq/L, these patients will be prescribed Veltassa according to the recommended dosing scheme. Individuals randomized to the usual care group will be under the care of their physicians and will receive the current standard of care. They will be able to take Veltassa, if prescribed by their physician, but this will not be required by the study protocol. At baseline, and at month 6, when the blood samples are taken for potassium assessment, some of the sample will also be used for the assessment of other biomarkers that will be tracked in this study (e.g., phosphorus, inflammatory markers, etc) After 6 months of participation in the study, individuals will be retested with the same protocols used at baseline. Pretest instructions: Following the signing of the consent form, patients will be given instructions as to how to complete a 3_day diet log. Patients will be asked to complete the Exercise Benefits/Barriers Scale (EBBS) and they will be expected to send these completed forms to the faculty at Springfield College prior to arriving at the College for their day_long program. Program Day: Patients will be expected to come to Springfield College on a Saturday and participate in the program from 8:45 am to approximately 4 PM depending upon their group assignment. Upon arrival at the College, participants will be asked to have all the medications and over_the_counter drugs documented by clinical Pharm D researchers. Any participants who had not previously submitted their dietary information prior to coming will be asked to submit their logs at that time and a member of the research team will take their records and analyze them during the time while they are undergoing the other assessments. Assessments During the morning period all patients are assessed for the following variables: Anthropometrics: Anthropometric measurements including height and weight will be taken. Waist girth will be assessed using a tension tape measure (Gulick) while body composition will be assessed using bioelectric impedance analysis (Tanita, model BC_418). Cardiovascular assessments: Prior to performing any activity assessment for the day, patients will have their resting blood pressure determined, in their dominant arm, using a calibrated automated sphygmomanometer (Tango, Sun Tech Medical, Morrisville, NC). They will also have pulse wave analysis (PWA) performed on them using a Sphymocor machine (EXCEL). This will give information about their augmentation index (a measure of arterial stiffness), along with a measure of their central blood pressure and pulse pressure. Pharmacy Methods: In the intervention group, the pharmacist will follow the following algorithm which is based on the most recent KDIGO guidelines: 1. If the subject is on a RAS blocker, the pharmacist will titrate the dose up to maximal dose in order to achieve a BP <130/80. Functional Movement Screen (FMS): Each participant will be assessed on their ability to perform each of the following movements without restriction: deep squat, active straight leg raise, shoulder mobility, trunk stability push up. A score is assigned based upon how well these move ents are performed. Functional tests: Following the anthropometric assessments, a series of functional tests will be administered. The six minute walk test will be performed with each participant according to American Thoracic Society guidelines. A 20_meter, flat hallway will be used as the course with cones set at each end as a marker. Every 3 feet will be marked along the course. Chairs will be available to the participants at both ends of the course, as well as the middle distance mark. Participants will be instructed to complete the most distance in the time allotted, only walking. At each minute, the participants will be told ""You are doing well, you have 5 (4, 3, 2, 1) minutes to go."" When 15 seconds are left, the participants will be told to wait for a ""Stop"" command and instructed to stop wherever they are on the course. The partial lap distance will then be recorded and added to the total lap distance. The sit_to_stand_to_sit test will also be used for all participants. A sturdy, armless chair with a height of 43.7 cm will be used. Each participant will be instructed to fold their hands over their chest and complete one practice sit_to_stand_to_sit. It will be made clear that no hands are allowed to be used. Then, each participant will be instructed to sit up and down ten times as fast as they can and the time to complete this will be recorded in seconds. A Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) score will be created by summation of the scores for tests of standing balance, gait speed, and rising from a chair 5 times. The SPPB has been shown to have excellent reliability and predictive validity for a number of outcomes including mortality, onset of disability, and institutionalization, and has been used in large, multicenter, randomized controlled trials and observational studies as a primary outcome and for screening purposes. Grip Strength: Grip strength will be assessed using a Jamar hand held dynamometer. Participants will be asked to sit in a chair while flexing their dominant arm to a 90¡ angle. The dynamometer will be fitted to each individual's hand and then each participant will be asked to exert maximal effort three times. The highest recorded score (in kg) will be used in statistical analyses. After these testing sessions are completed, individuals assigned to the usual care group will receive dietary advice and then be allowed to go home while individuals randomized to the intervention groups will be given instructions as to how to prepare a plant_based meal by a professional chef at the College's dining services. Following lunch, each participant will rotate through each of the following stations to receive one_on_one counseling from experts in the specific areas based upon their own specific scores from their earlier assessments. The following section contains information regarding the specific information that will be covered in each of those areas: 2. If the patient has an elevated urinary albumin excretion, the RAS inhibitor dose will also be titrated to the maximal dose. Strength/Power Assessments: Baseline strength and power will also be assessed with the dominant leg (quadriceps and hamstrings) using isokinetic dynamometry (Biodex). The purpose of the test will be explained to the participants. Each participant will then be strapped into the seat securely using chest straps, a lap strap and leg strap. The straps are to ensure no accessory muscles are used during the test. The participant will then be adjusted into the machine so that the fulcrum of the lateral aspect of the dominant knee is exactly aligned with axis or rotation on the machine. All baseline adjustments will be recorded for each participant at this point. Once the participant is ready to engage, their information regarding ROM and weight of the limb will be adjusted according to computer program procedures. Each participant will be given a trial round of 4 repetitions and will be instructed to push and pull with their leg as hard as they could. Then, 3 rounds of testing will be completed at 5 repetit ons for each speed of 90/120/150 degrees per seconds. Each participant will be reminded to breathe, and not hold their breath during the time they are being assessed. Strength and power measurements will then be recorded for each participant. Behavioral Methods Instruments: Kidney Disease and Quality of Life (KDQOL) _ Short Form (12). The KDQOL_36ª is a short form that includes the SF_12 as generic core supplemented with multi_item scales targeted at particular concerns of individuals with kidney disease (i.e. the burden of kidney disease, symptoms/problems of kidney disease, and effects of kidney disease scales on daily life). The KDQOL_SF is derived from the KDQOL(13), the long_form of the questionnaire, whose use is limited by its length (134 items). The questionnaire is one of the most complete instruments currently available to assess the health related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients because it includes general and specific aspects of health, allowing a more complete evaluation of HRQOL dimensions that are relevant for the patients . The authors of the KDQOL developed a standalone Excel scoring tool which was used to score the instrument. The Self_Efficacy to Regulate Exercise Habits Questionnaire. Self_efficacy to regulate exercise habits relates to the belief that one can perform exercise activities in the face of impediments (e.g.., fatigue, time constraints, unfavorable environmental conditions, and competing demands). Subjects will rate themselves on scales that range from 0 (""cannot do""); through intermediate degrees of assurance, 50 (""moderately certain can do""); to complete assurance, 100 (""highly certain can do""). The Self_Efficacy to Regulate Eating Habits Questionnaire (Cronbach alpha = 0.93) Subjects will be asked to rate their confidence in being able to ""stick to healthy eating habits"" when faced with different tempting situations (e.g. when very hungry, when eating out with others, during holiday times, when feeling upset). Subjects rate themselves on scales that range from 0 (""cannot do""); through intermediate degrees of assurance, 50 (""moderately certain can do""); to complete assurance, 100 (""highly certain can do""). Follow_up contact will be made via email by the same counselor who met with the patient at the assessment visit, at one week post_assessment and monthly thereafter. These emails will focus on the extent to which patients have achieved their goals since last contact, and patients will be reinforced or assisted in problem_solving additional strategies as appropriate. Patients will also receive additional written materials tailored to their current concerns (e.g. focusing on lapse and relapse, discussion of time management strategies, and cues to get back into an activity plan after holidays). Participants in the intervention conditions will be given brief individualized counselling to achieve their lifestyle goals. Participants will meet one_on_one with a behavioral health counselor to develop their personalized self_management program. A program will be formulated for each patient in which manageable goals for lifestyle change are negotiated, and specific individually tailored intervention strategies to increase self_efficacy and decrease barriers to change will be developed. The key features of the intervention will be a) assessment of current physical activity and dietary habits, b) investigating the perceived benefits, barriers and costs of behavior change, c) patient participation in goal setting and selecting personalized strategies to overcome barriers and prevent relapse, and d) establishing follow_up contacts. Regular self_assessment will be used to empower participants to take responsibility for their own decisions and to make informed choices. A clinical PharmD researcher will conduct patient interviews. Preparation for the interviews include contacting the participants requesting that they bring all prescription and over_the_counter medications to the ""Move to Health Study."" Patients will be specifically informed to bring all pres ription (including those only taken as needed), over the counter medications (such as medicine for sleep, allergies, etc.), vitamins, herbals, creams and inhalers used within the past month. At the beginning of the Move to Health Study, participants will provide their bag of medications to the pharmacist. While the patients are completing the initial phases of the study, the pharmacist will document each medication including dosage, sig, day's supply and last refill date, and will evaluate each medication for nephrotoxic effects, interactions, contraindications and medication appropriateness in CKD. This will be done for each patient without the pharmacist's knowledge of patient randomization group. Any medication that is identified as potentially harmful or nephrotoxic for any patient will be addressed with the lead physician of the study group for further discussion. 3. If the potassium is >5.2, Veltassa will be provided and dosed according to the PI Nutrition Methods Participants will be required to keep a 3_day food log prior to the day_long program. The information from the food logs will be analyzed with a Food Processor Diet Analysis Software program (ESHA, Salem, OR) for nutritional content. The ESHA Food Processor Nutrition Analysis software is widely used to assess the nutrient content of food in both research and clinical practice. The software provides analyses for more than 55,000 foods and food items, providing analysis for more than 163 nutritional components. Planned Follow up All participants in the Move to Health Study will be expected to return to the College approximately one, three and 6 months to be reassessed with the identical procedures as performed at the initial visit. Standard CKD labs (CBC, electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, PTH. magnesium, uric acid and urinary albumin excretion) will be measured at each assessment. Once patients are randomized, those assigned to the intervention groups will meet individually with the pharmacist. Patients in the usual care group are excused without pharmacy associated changes as long as there are no medications identified as potentially harmful or nephrotoxic. A detailed patient medication history will be obtained, including the current dose; schedule and patient reported side effects. Adherence and associated barriers will be assessed using the Morisky 8_point adherence tool (MMSA_8). Patients will also be asked specifically, ""Within the past week, how many doses of medication have you missed?"" Based upon the information gathered, the pharmacist will make evidence_based interventions. Interventions include providing each patient with a recommended dosing schedule, appropriate timing in relation to food and other medications, and tools to improve adherence. These tools include recommending pill organizers, timers and decreasing medication dosing frequency. Medication schedule will be based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics considerations as well as therapeutic guideline recommendations. The administration of the drug will comply with the standard operating procedures followed at RTANE (see attached SOP). The medications will be stored at RTANE in a research refrigerator that is maintained at 2_8 ¡C temperature and when dispensed to subjects they will be told to do the same. This research refrigerator is monitored to make sure that it is keeping the stored medications at the correct temperature. Patients will be educated about medication indication, OTC and herbal medications to eliminate and to avoid (e.g., NSAIDs). Patients will be provided an opportunity to ask medication related questions that will be addressed individually by the pharmacist. _ Wall latissimus dorsi stretch. Subjects will also be instructed to aim to walk for at least 30 minutes, 5 times per week at a moderate intensity to comply with standard physical activity recommendations of accumulating at least 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity physical activity. They will be instructed to avoid prolonged periods of time engaging in sedentary behavior by aiming to reduce s tting time. Examples of ways to reduce this sedentary behavior will be discussed with each participant and they will be encouraged to implement strategies that could work for them. Some that could be used include standing during commercial breaks while watching television and consciously taking movement breaks during each hour by setting a timer for 15_20 intervals. During the dietary consultation, the diet analysis will be reviewed with the participant, regarding their individual dietary macronutrient and micronutrient content. Specific attention will be paid to the amount and quality of protein, as well as the amount of sodium, phosphorous, and potassium contained in the diet. Recommendations for dietary modifications will be based on a vegan approach. Participants in the intervention group will be encouraged to decrease the amount of animal protein in their diet and choose more plant_based meals. The quality of animal protein will be addressed; with red meat and dairy products most highly discouraged, followed by poultry, and fish. Education will be provided on the significance of reducing sodium, phosphorous, and potassium on kidney health. Strategies to reduce the intake of these micronutrients will be presented, specifically what types of foods to avoid and what types to include more of in the diet. Individual barriers to success in achieving the suggested dietary modifications will be addressed, and strategies to implement the changes will be discussed based on the participant's individual circumstances. Participants will also attend lunch with a cooking education session, in which a professional chef will demonstrate how to prepare a vegan meal. During this session, strategies to enhance the flavor and appeal of plant_based meals will be presented to aid participants in being able to practically include plant_based meals in their daily diet. The treatment group will have an unrestricted potassium diet. Individuals randomized to the control group will be counseled on a standard 1 gram/kg protein diet with 2 gram potassium and sodium restriction. Dietary adherence will be assessed in the control and intervention group using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). A standard portion size and six possible frequency of consumption responses, ranging from ""never"" to ""two or more times per day"" will be given for each food group based on food and nutrients emphasized or minimized in the prescribed diet (i.e., animal protein, sodium, and potassium). Physical fitness methods: Based upon the performance of the FMS, individuals will be counseled with regard to the types of exercises they should perform. The prescribed exercises will be demonstrated and taught to the subjects so that when they leave to go home they know how to perform the exercises in correct form. Examples of exercises that could be demonstrated are as follows: _ Wall hip hinge _ Chair squat _ Dumbbell bent over row _ Seated horizontal band row _ Seated vertical band row _ elevated push up and wall push up _ Seated one arm dumbbell press, _ Band curl, _ Band triceps push down Each participant will be also given a set of stretches to perform and will be taught how to perform these stretches by the research staff members responsible for fitness. Examples of stretches that could be used are as follows: _ Wall calf stretch _ Seated and standing hamstring stretch _ Chair quadriceps stretch _ Wall chest stretch Physical Activity Monitoring: By the end of the testing day, each participant will be given a GT3XPB Actigraph monitor (Actigraph, Pensacola, FL) with instructions to wear the monitor for the following 7 days. They will then be asked to return this monitor to the research coordinator who will download the data for storage and later analysis. This process will be repeated each time participants come to the College for testing. Objective data captured by the ActiGraph system (i.e., mean times spent in sedentary behavior, light, and moderate to vigorous physical activity) will be used to compare physical activity and sedentary b havior in the intervention and control group as a measure of exercise adherence. As previously stated, participants in the intervention group will be issued with a packet of exercises to do at home. This packet will contain simple step by step instructions and illustrations of how to perform these movements with correct form. Prior to leaving the College for the day, each of these exercises will be demonstrated to each participant and they will be taught how to perform these exercises in correct form. A member of the research group will contact them (either by phone or email) at the beginning of each week during the intervention period to review with them the exercise program for the week to come and to discuss any challenges that they might have encountered in the previous week. The means of communication used will be decided upon depending upon the preference of the participant. During these weekly communications, the member from the research team will review the strategies the participant has been using to reduce sedentary behavior and provide encouragement in these endeavors. Participants will also be required to keep a log of their activities and return this log to the research team when they return for their retest dates. The activity log serves as a motivational tool and as an aid for the research team to supervise (and adapt if necessary) the exercise program. Participants will be encouraged to contact the research coordinator at any time if they have any questions or need clarification while performing their home_based exercise program. Data Storage All study data will be collected and managed using Research Electronic Data Capture) REDCap electronic data capture tools.

Nct	Randomized Controlled Trial of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in Severe Obesity	2017		CN-01563832	"Obesity is a main threat to public health in western countries. This condition increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, physical stress disorders, dispose for cancer and contributes to increased overall morbidity and mortality. However sustained weight loss lead to the reduction of risk factors and improvement of several obesity related co_morbidities. Currently there are mainly two established treatments for severe obesity: a conservative approach through lifestyle intervention and a surgical approach with bariatric surgery. The gut microbiota is recognized as an environmental modulator of nutritional uptake and body weight. This has led to the hypothesis that the gut microbiota could be a therapeutic target fighting obesity. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been applied for more than 50 years, and is a established treatment for refractory recurrent infection with Clostridium Difficile (CDI). Recent scientific studies have also applied FMT as treatment for other diseases like inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel disease and even metabolic syndrome and the results are promising. The investigators are planning a randomized, double_blinded and placebo controlled prospective trial with sixty patients to investigate the effect of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on body weight in patients with severe obesity. In the trial there will also be collected data that possibly could give a better understanding of mechanisms of this correlation; with insulin resistance, blood pressure, inflammation and biochemical parameters of hepatic steatosis, hunger related hormons, changes in the patients microbiota and the development in quality of life as secondary outcome measures."
Nct	Assessing the Value of eHealth for Bariatric Surgery	2017		CN-01578578	"Bariatric surgery is the only treatment with long standing effect of morbid obesity. The key elements to success are the patient_selection, an experienced bariatric team and a completed follow_up program. Follow_up programs can consist of, for example, providing social support in support groups, teaching psychological skills, such as coping with the body change or teaching self_regulation of body weight. Furthermore, follow_up is important for dietary and sports counselling. The experience of the team members and coaching skills are essential in indicating the suitable procedure if necessary and guide the patients through the process. Various studies showed a significant positive effect of a completed follow_up program after bariatric surgery on maintaining weight loss. There is a burden for this on site provided care as organizational and financial resources are not unlimited. Especially as the follow_up period is an obligatory 5 years or if possible life long. Even if this aftercare is provided, not all patients complete the complete program. Various reasons are possible for an increasing no_show_rate, the loss of enthusiasm for onsite visits could be one of them. Analogue to other chronic diseases, the addition of telehealth could be useful. Telehealth is the delivery of health_related services and information via telecommunications technologies. It encompasses preventative, promotive and curative aspects. Examples are exchanging health services or education via videoconference, transmission of medical data for disease management (remote monitoring) and advice on prevention of diseases and promotion of good health by patient monitoring and follow_up. The participation of eHealth has been investigated and considered useful in the treatment of obesity. In a systematic review self_measured blood pressure monitoring was associated with better control of hypertension at least in the first year. Its value in a bariatric tract has not been investigated. It can be hypothesized that self_control by eHealth could enhance clinical outcome as more weight loss and comorbidity reduction. Long_term realistic goals setting, consistent use of routines and self_monitoring has been proven effective for weight loss maintenance. Patients with higher self_control are more certain regarding their abilities, which cause higher commitment and adherence to the program. This eventually leads to more weight loss. For this purpose an online monitoring program was designed for our Obesity Centre (BePATIENT) to provide preoperative information as well as aids in the post_bariatric phase by self_control wireless devices for registration of biometric outcomes, teleconference opportunities and access to additional information. In a prospective trial the implementation in several degrees is evaluated."
Nct	Early Goal Directed Therapy Using a Physiological Holistic View. The ANDROMEDA-SHOCK Study	2017		CN-02041272	"Early Goal Directed Therapy using a Physiological Holistic View. A multicenter study in Latin America: The ANDROMEDA_SHOCK Study Hypothesis Peripheral perfusion guided resuscitation in septic shock is associated with lower mortality, less organ dysfunctions, less mechanical ventilation (MV), less vasopressor load, and less renal replacement therapies than a lactate_targeted resuscitation strategy. Using a holistic view of optimizing tissue perfusion and oxygenation the investigators aim to decrease mortality and morbidity in septic shock patients. A. Background Septic shock is a highly lethal condition associated with a mortality risk of 30 to 60%. It is currently the most frequent cause of death in the intensive care unit (ICU) as the investigators demonstrated in a recent Chilean prevalence study. Several pathogenic factors such as hypovolemia, myocardial depression, vasoplegia, and microcirculatory abnormalities can induce progressive tissue hypoperfusion in severe cases. In this context, persistent hyperlactatemia has been traditionally considered as the hallmark of ongoing tissue hypoxia during septic shock, and therefore lactate normalization is recommended as a resuscitation target by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC). Pathophysiologic determinants of persistent hyperlactatemia The physiologic basis of lactate generation or clearance during septic shock has been matter of active research. Hypovolemia_induced hypoperfusion is probably the predominant pathogenic mechanism during the early phase. Some patients resolve acute circulatory dysfunction and clear lactate after initial fluid resuscitation, while others evolve into a persistent circulatory dysfunction with hyperlactatemia. Several mechanisms have been associated to persistent hyperlactatemia besides hypoperfusion, but recent literature has highlighted the role of sustained hyperadrenergia with increased muscle aerobic glycolysis, a condition denominated stress hyperlactatemia, and also of impaired hepatic lactate clearance. Is hyperlactatemia a valid resuscitation target in septic shock? Not surprisingly, lactate clearance or normalization is used worldwide as resuscitation targets. Indeed, SSC the most ambitious and global collaboration in critical care has proposed to focus septic shock resuscitation on normalizing macrohemodynamic parameters and lactate. SSC guidelines are followed in many countries and adherence to recommended management bundles have been reported to be associated to improved survival, although the role of each individual component is not clear. Lactate clearance, defined by a change of lactate levels between two time_points, and expressed as a 10_20% hourly lactate reduction, or a decrease of at least 10% in 6h during early resuscitation has been related to survival, and tested as a goal in two important studies with conflicting results. Potential alternative resuscitation targets in septic shock Peripheral perfusion as a potential resuscitation target in septic shock patients The skin territory lacks auto_regulatory flow control, and therefore sympathetic activation impairs skin perfusion during circulatory dysfunction, a process that could be evaluated by peripheral perfusion assessment. Indeed, peripheral perfusion can be easily evaluated in many ways at bedside, and therefore, it could be a valuable monitoring tool in any setting. The presence of a cold clammy skin, mottling or CRT are frequently described as indications to initiate fluid resuscitation in patients with sepsis_related acute circulatory dysfunction. Why to compare peripheral perfusion with lactate as targets for septic shock resuscitation? Design Multicenter, open_label randomized controlled study, conducted under supervision of an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The investigators have explored the significance and potential determinants of hyperlactatemia in a series of clinical physiological studies performed over the last 15 years. These studies have addressed the three most relevant pathogenic factors involved in persisten hyperlactatemia: overt or occult hypoperfusion, hyperadrenergic state and impaired hepatic clearance. The complexity of this subject is also highlighted by a more recent study where the investigators demonstrated that lactate decrease during successful septic shock resuscitation exhibits a biphasic pattern, an early rapid decrease in parallel to normalization of more flow_sensitive variables (see below), followed by a slower recovery thereafter. The latter eventually related to non_flow dependent mechanisms such as hyperadrenergic state and/or delayed hepatic clearance. Persistent hyperlactatemia after initial resuscitation is particularly difficult to interpret as suggested by the extensive research summarized above. Optimizing systemic blood flow might reverse ongoing hypoperfusion, a potential source of anaerobic lactate generation. Under this perspective, some of the pathogenic factors involved in hyperlactatemia are potentially flow_sensitive, and others are not. Distinction between the two scenarios could strongly impact further resuscitation. If persistent hyperlactatemia is caused by non_hypoperfusion_related mechanisms, then sustained efforts aimed at increasing CO could lead to detrimental effects of excessive fluids or inotropes, a fact now well demonstrated in the literature. The decision of when to consider that a patient has been fully resuscitated and as a consequence stop further interventions is a milestone, and appears as highly relevant since the results of a number of recent studies have increased awareness about the risk of fluid overload and/or of vasopressors and inodilators such as pulmonary edema, increased intraabdominal hypertension, acute kidney injury, delayed weaning, arrhythmias, hepatosplanchnic or myocardial ischemia, among other problems. By these means, over_resuscitation could eventually increase morbidity and/or mortality. The concept of CRT, the most relevant parameter, is based on this assumption. It was proposed initially in trauma patients but some negative studies that found no correlation with systemic hemodynamics precluded further research on this variable. More recently however, Lima et al found that abnormal peripheral perfusion is associated with hyperlactatemia and organ dysfunctions in critically ill patients. Other authors confirmed this finding and built up a robust body of evidence supporting the strong prognostic value of abnormal peripheral perfusion in the intensive care unit (ICU) context. How can fluid loading and resuscitation improve peripheral perfusion? There is an intricate relationship between macrohemodynamics and peripheral perfusion. Both are affected by hypovolemia and tend to improve in parallel in fluid_responsive patients. Their relative changes, though, are not well correlated. The beneficial effects of fluids and vasoactive drugs may be explained by an increase in CO or perfusion pressure, a decrease in the neurohumoral response to hypovolemia, and eventually by direct effects at the microcirculatory level. Whatever the mechanism, normalization of peripheral perfusion parameters appears to indicate a successful reversal of initial circulatory dysfunction. Main Objective To test if peripheral perfusion targeted resuscitation in septic shock is associated with lower 28_day mortality than a lactate targeted resuscitation. Primary Outcome All_cause 28_day mortality I. Patients Inclusion Criteria Adult patients (³18 years) will be screened for the following inclusion criteria: Exclusion Criteria However, there are several unresolved aspects and concerns about the role of lactate as an appropriate resuscitation target. First, it is not clear if selecting lactate clearance versus lactate normalization as resuscitation goals is equivalent, but more importantly, if this decision leads to similar timely resolution of tissue hypoperfusion or hypoxia. Second, since non_hypoperfusion related causes of hyperlactatemia might predominate in an unknown number of patients, this could lead to over_resuscitation in at least some of them as st ted above. Third, the dynamics of recovery of lactate might exhibit a biphasic pattern and therefore, the real_time response of lactate to fluid challenges could be not straightforward depending on the hypoperfusion context. Some survivors might even normalize lactate only after 24h of evolution. Therefore, to explore other potential resuscitation targets appears as mandatory. A foremost priority is to rule out ongoing hypoperfusion in septic septic shock patients under active resuscitation. The investigators recently proposed that a simultaneous analysis of central venous O2 saturation (ScvO2), central venous_arterial pCO2 gradient (P(cv_a)CO2), and peripheral perfusion as assessed by capillary refill time (CRT), mottling score or central_to_toe temperature differences, might be helpful in suggesting a hypoperfusion context for patients with or without hyperlactatemia. From a theoretical point of view, these three easily assessable perfusion_related variables offer an important advantage over lactate as potential resuscitation targets in septic shock patients: they are clearly flow_sensitive and exhibit a much faster dynamics of recovery after systemic blood flow optimization. In other words, these parameters might clear in minutes in fluid_responsive patients as compared to lactate, which sometimes takes hours to recover. The investigators demonstrated this by analyzing the dynamics of recovery of these parameters in a cohort of ultimately surviving septic shock patients. ScvO2, P(cv_a)CO2 and CRT where already normal in almost 70% of the patients after 2h of fluid resuscitation, as compared with only 15% in the case of lactate. More recently Bakker et al, added another important piece of information after performing a pilot study in 30 septic shock patients subjected to early resuscitation. In this study, CRT and skin mottling were correlated with the pulsatility index, a sonographic surrogate of vascular tone, of visceral organs. This means that improvement in peripheral perfusion might move in parallel with improvement in hepatosplanchnic perfusion, eventually explaining the good prognosis associated with recovery of CRT and other related parameters. Using peripheral perfusion to target resuscitation in septic shock has also several potential drawbacks. First, there is some degree of subjectivity and inter_observer variability in some of the parameters used to assess it such as CRT and mottling. Second, it cannot be evaluated in some settings such as dark skin patients. Third, and more importantly, the corpus of evidence that supports that improvement of peripheral perfusion is associated with resolution of profound tissue or microcirculatory hypoperfusion, or hypoxia is still scanty. 1. Pregnancy 2. Anticipated surgery or dialysis procedure during the first 8h after septic shock diagnosis 3. Do_not_resuscitate status 4. Child B or C liver cirrhosis 5. Active bleeding 6. Acute hematological malignancy 7. Severe concomitant acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 8. More than 4h after officially meeting septic shock criteria However, there are also a couple of drawbacks for some of these perfusion_related flow_sensitive parameters. ScvO2 is a complex physiological variable. It was widely used until recently as the resuscitation goal in critically ill patients, although several limitations may preclude a straightforward interpretation of its changes. For instance, normal or even supranormal ScvO2 values do not rule_out global or regional tissue hypoxia for several reasons that have been highlighted elsewhere, but that include severe microcirculatory derangements impairing tissue O2 extraction capabilities. Vallee et al found persistent abnormal P(cv_a)CO2 values in 50% of septic shock patients who had already achieved normal ScvO2 values after initial resuscitation. Nevertheless, in some hyperdynamic states a high efferent venous blood flow could be sufficient to wash out the global carbon dioxide (CO2) generation from hypoperfused tissues and thus, P(cv_a)CO2 could be normal despi e the presence of tissue hypoxia. Another problem for these two variables is that they necessarily require a central venous catheterization to be assessed, a task that might be complex to perform in limited_resource settings or emergency departments (ED). Therefore, peripheral perfusion appears as the most promising alternative resuscitation target in septic shock patients. The investigators observed that CRT was the first parameter to be normalized in a cohort of septic shock patients and this predicted lactate normalization at 24h and survival. Moreover, some recent clinical data suggest that targeting peripheral perfusion during septic shock resuscitation might improve outcome. van Genderen et al performed a randomized controlled trial comparing two resuscitation protocols; one targeted at normal peripheral perfusion and the other to standard management in 30 ICU patients. The study demonstrated that targeting peripheral perfusion is safe, and associated with less fluid administration and organ dysfunctions. Therefore, a parameter like CRT with a rapid_response time could be very useful to test the response to treatments with strong physiologic impact such as fluid loading, especially at the ED or in limited_resource settings. In a prospective non published study performed in a cohort of 100 patients just admitted to the ED, the investigators found that patients exhibiting a normal CRT after initial fluid loading had a hospital mortality of less than 10% as compared to 55% in patients with abnormal values. However, the excellent prognosis associated with CRT recovery, the rapid_response time to fluid loading, the simplicity of its assessment, its availability in limited resource settings, and recent data suggesting that it might change in parallel to perfusion of physiologically more relevant territories such as the hepatosplanchnic region, constitute a strong background to promote studies evaluating its usefulness to guide resuscitation in septic shock patients. Hypothesis Peripheral perfusion guided resuscitation in septic shock is associated with lower mortality, less organ dysfunctions, less mechanical ventilation (MV), less vasopressor load, and less renal replacement therapies than a lactate_targeted resuscitation strategy. There are some data that suggest that vasopressor adjustment and/or inodilators could induce favorable effects on peripheral perfusion or microcirculation under certain circumstances. Jhanji et al demonstrated that increasing mean arterial pressure (MAP) to 90 mmHg with norepinephrine (NE) doses up to 0.41 mcg/kg/min improved cutaneous tissue oxygen pressure (PtO2) and cutaneous microvascular red blood cell flux in a cohort of septic shock patients. The same group obtained similar results in another cohort of postoperative patients after major abdominal surgery but with an intervention consisting in stroke volume optimization with fluid challenges and an inodilator (dopexamine) in fixed dose. Dubin et al demonstrated that rising MAP to 85 mmHg with incremental doses of norepinephrine (NE) up to 0.74 mcg/kg/min improved sublingual microcirculatory flow in septic shock patients with the worst microcirculation at baseline. Dobutamine in fixed doses of 5 mcg/kg/min improved sublingual microcirculatory flow in another cohort of septic shock patients. On the other hand active vasodilation with nitroglycerine induced a clear improvement of peripheral perfusion parameters in a group of shock patients, despite a mean fall in MAP of 14 mmHg. Based on these findings and other data, it was proposed that permisive hypotension could eventually improve microcirculatory driving_pressure in patients with acute circulatory failure. In summary, it appears that pharmacological therapies aimed at improving peripheral perfusion might be individually tailored but could imply increasing or lowering vasopressors and MAP, inodilators or pure vasodilators according to the clinical context. Summarizing the theoretical background stated above, it is plausible that normalization of peripheral perfusion as comp red to normalization or a rapid decrease (>20%/2h) of lactate might be associated with less fluid resuscitation and secondarily less positive 24h fluid balances. Eventually, less positive fluid balances might be associated with less organ dysfunctions, especially respiratory (oxygenation, mechanical ventilation days), renal (less increase in creatinine and renal replacement therapy), and gastrointestinal (less increase in intra_abdominal pressure). In addition, peripheral perfusion targeted_resuscitation might be also associated with less vasopressor load and inodilator use thus preventing other set of potential complications such as hepatosplanchnic hypoperfusion, arrhythmias or myocardial ischemia. At the end, this could result in less mortality for a combination of the previous reasons. Secondary outcomes Need of mechanical ventilation Need of renal replacement therapies (RRT) Days free of MV, vasopressors and RRT in 28_days Sequential Organ failure Assessment (SOFA) at 8, 24, 48 and 72h Acute kidney injury (AKI) Intra_abdominal hypertension Fluid balances at 8, 24, 48 and 72h All_cause hospital and 90_day mortality Intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay Septic shock diagnosed at ICU admission according to the Sepsis_3 Consensus Conference, (basically septic patients with hypotension requiring norepinephrine (NE) to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of ³ 65 mmHg, and serum lactate levels > 2 mmol/l after initial fluid resuscitation with at least 20/ml kg in one hour. II. Randomization Recruited patients will be randomized to a peripheral perfusion_targeted resuscitation (group A) with a goal of normalizing capillary refill time (CRT), or a lactate_targeted resuscitation (group B) with a goal of either normalizing lactate or achieving a >20% decrease per hour during the 8h study period. The randomization sequence will be generated by an external statistician of the DSMB with the use of a computer program and an allocation of 1:1. The randomization using a block size of eight will be stratified according to participating centers. Allocation concealment will be maintained by means of a web_based central, automated randomization system, available 24 hours a day (RedCap Cloud). The group to which the patient is allocated will only be disclosed after the information is recorded in the electronic system. Such measure prevents the investigator and the medical team from predicting to which treatment group the patient will be allocated. To include a patient in the study, investigators must simply access the study website and fill in a short medical record form. Statisticians and the researcher responsible for event assignment will be blinded to the group allocation. Treatment assignment will not be recorded in the medical chart or electronic patient data monitoring system and clinicians on general wards, who care for the patients after ICU discharge, will not be aware of the treatment assignment. III. Assessments Baseline Demographics, comorbidities, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II, sepsis source and treatment pre_ICU resuscitation and fluid balance Biomarkers: procalcitonin (PCT) or c_reactive protein (CRP), and adrenomedullin (MR_ProADM) sampling SOFA + AKI criteria Hemodynamics: heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), MAP, central venous pressure (CVP), dynamic predictors (DP) of fluid responsiveness (FR), intraabdominal pressure (IAP), NE levels, diuresis Perfusion: lactate, ScvO2, P(cv_a)CO2, hemoglobin (Hb), central venous and arterial blood gases, CRT, mottling score, perfusion index (where available) Evolution SOFA and AKI criteria at 8, 24, 48 and 72h Hemodynamics hourly up to 8h Fluid administration and balance at 8, 24, 48 y 72h Complete perfusion assessment when the targeted parameter is normalized and then at 8, 24, 48 and 72h Register of vasoactive drugs and dobutamine/milrinone use Register of MV and RRT Source control re_analysis at 4h Rescue therapies: high_volume hemofiltration (HVHF), vaso ressin, epinephrine, steroids, others Echocardiography at least once during the study period Follow_up till 28 days for use of MV, RRT and vasopressors All cause mortality at hospital discharge, 28 and 90 days Cause of death IV. Principles of general management Sepsis source identification and treatment should be pursued as a priority of first line treatment. A central venous catheter and an arterial line are inserted in all, and the use of a pulmonary artery catheter or a PiCCO device is recommended for patients with a past medical history of heart failure or with concomitant ARDS. Echocardiography will be performed routinely as soon as possible after admission to evaluate basal cardiac function, and repeated as necessary to aid in assessing preload status through inferior vena cava distensibility when necessary. NE will be the vasopressor of choice and adjusted to a MAP ³ 65 mmHg in all patients. C. Study protocol The study period will be of 8 hours and after this, attending intensivists can continue treatment according to their usual practice or department protocol. Fluid responsiveness (FR) This is the first step. FR will be assessed with a structured approach. Basically, dynamic predictors (DP) will be evaluated depending on the patient background status. Hemoglobin concentrations will be maintained at 8 g/dl or higher to optimize arterial O2 content. Mechanical ventilation settings are adjusted according to current recommendation. Rescue therapies such as epinephrine, vasopressin analogues, steroids or different blood purification techniques like high_volume hemofiltration will be decided following usual practice of the involved centers in patients evolving with refractory septic shock. A sequential approach to resuscitation will be followed in both groups. Time 0 is the starting point when after randomization, a central venous catheter (CVC) and an arterial line are in place, and the basal measurements are performed including hemodynamics and blood sampling. I. Tests and Procedures during the study period Capillary refill time assessment CRT will be measured by applying firm pressure to the ventral surface of the right index finger distal phalanx with a glass microscope slide. The pressure will be increased until the skin is blank and then maintained for 10 seconds. The time for return of the normal skin color will be registered with a chronometer, and > 3 seconds is defined as abnormal. Lactate measurements A normal lactate value is defined as less then 2 mmol/l. Lactate will be assessed with the technique more easily available for each center, including arterial serum levels (with common gas analyzers at the central lab), or capillary levels with lactate scout strips. In sedated adapted mechanically ventilated patients without arrhythmias, pulse pressure variation (PPV) or stroke volume variation (SVV) will be used as first choice. A FR+ status is established with values ³ 13% and 10%, respectively. If negative, PPV and SVV will be reassessed after transiently increasing tidal volume (VT) to 8 ml/kg (one minute). An increase >3.5% and 2.5% in PPV or SVV, respectively will be considered as FR+. In patients with arrhythmia, the preferred tests will be the end expiratory occlusion test with a 15 sec pause (> pulse pressure >5% considered as positive), or echocardiography assessing inferior vena cava (IVC) distensibility index (>15% considered as +). In spontaneous breathing patients or non_sedated patients under MV, a passive leg rising (PLR) maneuver will performed with an early (<1min) increase in pulse pressure > 10% considered as FR+. If this is not obtained and to rule out a false negative response, the maneuver will be repeated assessing aortic velocity time integral (VTI) with echocardiography before and after PLR with a >15% increase in VTI accepted as FR+. Fluid Challenge In FR+ patients, the first resuscitation step is to administer a fluid bolus (FB) of 500 ml of crystalloids every 30 min until CRT is normalized in group A, or DP becomes negative in group B. DP and CVP will be measured before a d after each bolus in both groups. Safety measures during fluid challenges Central venous pressure (CVP) and FR will be reevaluated after any fluid challenge. If CVP increases <5 mmHg and FR is still +, another FB is administered and so on while the goal is not reached. If CVP increases ³ 5 mmHg or FR is _, fluids will be stopped and the patient will be moved to the next step. Vasopressor test In FR_ patients with persistent abnormal CRT or with a still abnormal lactate that decreased <20%/2h, a vasopressor test will be performed. The investigators will analyze the effects of the study fluids on the primary outcome in the following subgroups: 1. Patients with lactate > 4.0 mmol/l as set by SSC 2. Patients without a confirmed source of infection (as this could increase the translation of the study to other critically ill). 3. Patients with low APACHE II / SOFA scores 4. Patients with a more than 10% difference in lactate level between the very first one measured and the baseline when starting the study. In previously hypertensive patients, MAP will be increased to the range of 80_85 mmHg by transiently rising NE doses. CRT and lactate rechecked (CRT at one h and lactate at 2h). If CRT is normal in the group A, or lactate normalizes or decreases >20% in group B, resuscitation will be stopped and NE dose maintained. If not, NE will be reduced to the pre_test doses, and the protocol moves to the next step. In all the other patients, MAP will be reduced to the range of 60_65 mmHg by transient decreases in NE doses, with the same objectives and principles as stated above. Use of inodilators Dobutamine 5 mcg/kg/min or Milrinone 0.25 mcg/kg/min in fixed doses will be started, and CRT or lactate rechecked (CRT at one h and lactate at 2h). If, the goals are not reached, drugs will be discontinued and no further action will be taken during the study period, except recheck FR every hour and restart fluid challenges if patients get FR+ again. In responders (same criteria as with vasopressor test), the inodilator will be continued along the study period. As a safety measure, inodilators will be stopped if HR increases >15%, or arrhythmias, ischemia or hypotension develop. Group A. Management of peripheral perfusion_targeted resuscitation. In this group, the goal is to normalize CRT by following the next steps in the given order: 1. Assessment of FR 2. Fluid challenges until CRT is normal, the patient is fluid unresponsive or a safety measure is met 3. Vasopressor test 4. Inodilator test As a safety measure, resuscitation will be stopped even with normal CRT only in the presence of a stable macrohemodynamics as demonstrated by heart rate (HR) <120 beats per minute, and stable MAP with no increase in vasopressors during the last hour. After CRT normalization at any step, CRT will be reassessed hourly during the study period. If at any point, it turns abnormal again the resuscitation sequence will be restarted. Group B. Management of lactate_targeted resuscitation. In this group the goal is to normalize lactate levels or get a decrease rate of at least 20%/2h, by following the next steps in the given order, always reevaluating lactate at 2h intervals. 1. Assessment of FR 2. Fluid challenges until FR_ or safety CVP limit is reached during the bi_hourly intervals between lactate assessments 3. Vasopressor test 4. Inodilators Lactate will be assessed every two hours during the 8h study period. If after obtaining the lactate goal, lactate gets abnormal again or the decrease rate turns <20%/2h at any of the following bi_hourly controls during the study period, the resuscitation sequence will be restarted. D. Sample size Mortality in patients with increased lactate levels in circulatory dysfunction has been shown to exceed 40%. In addition, several studies have shown that abnormal peripheral perfusion is associated with a mortality exceeding 40%. The investigators should enroll 420 patients. With these sample size the study will have 90% power to detect a reduction in 28_day mortality from 45% to 30%, at a significance evel of 5%, considering time_to_event analysis. The investigators consider a decrease of 15% in mortality to have direct clinical implementation effect. Similar effects on mortality have been shown in early resuscitation studies. In addition limiting fluid administration in patients with septic shock and normal peripheral perfusion has been shown to decrease organ failure, which is the leading cause of death in these patients. E. Statistical analysis plan A detailed statistical analysis plan will be prepared before proceeding to patient enrolment. The essential characteristics of this statistical analysis plan are described below. When aiming for a smaller decrease in mortality (like 10%), this sample size would only have 57% power to detect benefit. Therefore the investigators will use an adaptive approach that will allow for a sample_size re_estimation at the interim analysis when 75% of the sample has been recruited. The sample_size re_estimation will be conducted by the DSMB if the effect size observed in the interim analysis is between 10% and <15% absolute reduction in mortality. A smaller effect size would turn achieving adequate sample size unfeasible, whereas a larger effect size will provide the study with more than 90% power to detect the effect. All analyses will be based on the intention_to_treat principle. The investigators will assess the effect of peripheral perfusion_targeted resuscitation (group A) compared to lactate_targeted resuscitation (group B) on the primary outcome through hazard ratio with 95% of confidence interval (CI) and Kaplan_Meier curve comparison (using log_rank test). Binary secondary outcomes will be compared through relative risks, 95%CIs, and chi_square tests. Results for continuous outcomes with normal distribution will be expressed as mean difference, 95%CI, and P_value calculated by the t_test. Continuous outcomes with asymmetrical distribution will be assessed by the Wilcoxon test."
Nct	"Effects of Lavender Oil on Postoperative Pain, Sleep Quality and Mood"	2017		CN-01562932	"Background & Significance: Essential oils have been formally documented in use since the time of the Egyptians. The Ebers Papyrus document notes Egyptians using frankincense for different physical ailments. In Greece Hippocrates used essential oils to fumigate the city of Athens to fight off the plague. In medieval periods lavender essential oil was used for its antidepressive, anxiolytic, sedative, and analgesic properties. Medieval Persian physicians made records of their treatment plans which included lavender for depression and pain for headaches. With the invention of steam distillation to separate the essential oil from the plant Europe began to use oils in perfumes and for medicinal benefits in the 1500's. Two physicians named Hieronymus and Brunschwig wrote one of the earliest printed books on the distillation and use of essential oils for medical benefits. By the 19th century a French chemist Rene_ Maurice Gattefosse was known for studying essential oils and their therapeutic benefits. His work and documentation led the way for the support of essential oil in medical ailments. Robert Tisserand in the early 1990s reviewed the French chemists work and added to his research to help make essential oils more known to the public in present day. In recent years lavender has been studied on human subjects to tests its known reputation for sedative, anxiolytic, and analgesic properties. In one clinical trial oral administration of lavender was compared to Ativan 0.5mg for generalized anxiety disorder. The study supported that the oral lavender oil called Silexan was as effective as 0.5mg of Ativan in adults with generalized anxiety disorder. A second clinical trial analyzing sleep quality found that ischemic heart patients in the intensive care unit received better sleep with 100% lavender oil undiluted placed on a cotton ball within 20cm from the patient from the hours of 9pm_6am. Two studies have used lavender oil through inhalation in the recovery room with an oxygen mask after surgery for pain control. The first study was patients after breast biopsy, the second was patients who just had laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. The study with the breast biopsy patients showed a higher satisfaction rate with pain. The patients undergoing laparoscopic banding also showed a higher rate of satisfaction with pain as well as decreased opioid use in the recovery room. Furthermore one study used 100% lavender oil undiluted on the skin of pediatric patients undergoing tonsillectomy as a topical application and asked the patients to inhale. The study showed a decrease use in Tylenol usage postoperatively. Design & Procedures: Study Interventions: Blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation will be monitored in the preoperative area before lavender is given and 30 minutes after it is given. The level of pain will also be asked prior to application and at the second set of vitals. The control group will get two sets of vital measurements and pain scale measurements without any intervention. The same vitals will be recorded while the patient is under anesthesia every 30 minutes. There will be a notation in the chart when lavender is given to correlate time from application to time of vitals recorded. A review of the electronic medical record will be done to record amount of narcotic needed interop in both groups. Data Analysis & Statistical Considerations: Study Design/Endpoints: The primary outcome will be a difference in pain scores between the 2 groups and/or decrease in narcotic use and/or increased patient satisfaction of pain control. Design Randomized study with control group and test group. Using a 1:1 treatment allocation ratio, the total of 40 patients (20 per arm) will be randomly assigned to control or treatment arm. The Statistical Investigator will generate the randomization scheme and monitor the randomization process over the course of the trial. The study will use randomization with random permuted blocks. The test group will receive 50% lavender oil diluted in fractionated coconut o l and the control group will have the current standard of care with no essential oil intervention. Fractionated coconut oil is being used because it is colorless, odorless, does not stain clothing, and has a long shelf life. It also serves as a carrier oil for the essential oil to absorb into the skin instead of evaporating off the skin due to essential oils volatile nature. Study Procedure The lavender essential oil used will be from the company doTERRA. This essential oil company was chosen because this company has a medical and science governing board made up of physicians, surgeons, chemists and pharmacists. The oil is also third party tested by Dr. Robert Pappas a trusted chemist in the essential oil community for purity and quality. Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry are used to ensure purity and no unwanted substances are in the essential oil. doTERRA's essential oils have also already been used in a hospital setting at Vanderbilt University hospital in Tennessee. doTERRA's essential oils were diffused in the Vanderbilt ER at the nursing stations. After 3 months of diffusing staff felt less work related stress, less time feeling overwhelmed, and had more energy at work. After informed consent is obtained, exactly 4 drops of 50% lavender solution will be placed on the wrist over the radial artery. The patient will rub her wrists and hands together and then inhale and exhale slowly for one minute. This will occur thirty minutes before being taken to the operating room. The dilution of 50% was chosen after reviewing Robert Tisserand's book on essential oil safety, consulting a local certified aromatherapist, Cynthia Loving, and consulting Dr. David Hill, executive vice president and chief medical officer of doTERRA essential oils. This percent dilution is recommended on skin and is not likely to cause irritation to the skin. Repeated insult patch skin testing from doTERRA has supported this dilution rate to be safe to the skin. Furthermore a previous study used 100 % lavender oil on children age 5_12 undergoing tonsillectomy with no adverse reactions. The first dose will be given thirty minutes prior to the operating room because it takes 20 minutes for lavender to be absorbed thought the skin and reach peak plasma levels. In the recovery room after the patient is given lavender through the oxygen mask the same vital signs and pain score measurement will be taken 15, 30, and 60 minutes from lavender application. In the control group on arrival to the recovery room the same data points will be measured with the same time intervals with no intervention. The amount of narcotic needed in the recovery room will be taken from the electronic medical record for each group. Postoperatively on the floor vital signs as noted above will be recorded every 4 hours. At each 4 hour interval after the vital signs are taken lavender will be applied to the experimental group and no intervention in the control group. One more set of vitals signs will be recorded 45min after application of lavender each time lavender is applied. There will be a review of narcotic use from the electronic medical record from both groups. There will be a notation when lavender was given to correlate lavender application and narcotic use. During surgery the patient will receive 4 drops of 50% solution lavender oil on the temple region over the temporal artery every 2 hours until completion of surgery. This will be applied by the anesthesia team. If the temporal region is not accessible the shoulders or feet will be alternate locations of application. When the patient arrives to the recovery room she will receive lavender oil through an oxygen mask. A 50 % solution will be used by placing 4 drops of the lavender solution on the mask and wiping it around the mask with a cotton ball. This delivery method will be used because this was used in a study from New York University Medical Center studying postoperative pain and no adverse events occurred. When the patient is on the post_operative floor she will receive 50 % lavender oil on the wrist every 4 h urs in the same manner as preoperatively from the hours of 6am to 9pm. Nightly (9pm_6am), 8 drops of 50% lavender oil will be placed on the cotton ball situated within 20cm of the patient. This method and concentration was chosen after reviewing a study in ischemic heart patients in the intensive care unit. The patients received lavender at bedside on a cotton ball and had statistically significant better sleep quality. The control group will have the current standard of care with no lavender intervention. The anxiety questionnaire will be given preop before the application of lavender and then daily for every post_op day they stay. The questionnaire is called the hospital anxiety and depression scale. The sleep questionnaire will be given in preop before application of lavender and then daily for every post_op day they stay. The sleep questionnaire is called the Richard Campbell Sleep Questionnaire. Daily starting on postop day 1 the patient will also record their level of satisfaction of pain control from a scale of 1_10 with 1 being not satisfied and 10 being satisfied. Patients typically stay in hospital 1_3 days post_op. A survey will be filled out daily. Secondary outcomes are better sleep and decreased anxiety. The secondary outcome will be a difference in scores from the two surveys, the Richards Campbell sleep questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale. Analytic Plan and Method: Differences in the change scores of pain in the two groups as well any other demographic and clinical continuous variables will be examined using t_test or Wilcoxon test, depending on whether the variables are normally or non_normally distributed respectively. The differences between the categorical variables will be examined using chi_squared or Fisher's exact test. Analysis will be conducted under the intention to treat (ITT). Missing data will be imputed under multiple imputation methods. Differences in the outcomes while controlling for potential covariates (age, etc) will be examined using linear regression. Significance of the tests will be assessed at alpha = 0.05. Analysis will be conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC.)."
Nct	Ketamine for Pain Relief in Bariatric Surgery	2017		CN-01561978	"After obtaining approval from the hospital ethics committee and written informed consent from the patients, this prospective randomised study will be conducted on 76 patients belonging to ASA physical patients status II and III of either sex, scheduled to undergo laparoscopic bariatric surgery (sleeve gastrectomy, Roux_en_Y gastric bypass) under general anaesthesia. The patients will be randomly allocated by computer generated numbers to one of the following two groups of 38 patients each. Group 1[Ketamine + Fentanyl Group, n=38]: Pre_induction fentanyl 1_mcg/kg, ketamine 0.5_mg/kg after induction, followed by intra_operative fentanyl infusion of 0.5_mcg/kg/hr + ketamine infusion of 0.2_mg/kg/hr Group 2[Fentanyl Group, n=38]: Pre_induction fentanyl 1_mcg/kg, saline after induction followed by intra_operative fentanyl infusion of 0.5_mcg/kg/hr + saline infusion. Both the groups will receive intravenous PCA of fentanyl post_operatively. Randomisation, Allocation Concealment: The patients will be randomly allocated to one of the two groups based on a computer_generated random number table (url:stattrek.com/statistics/random_number_generator.aspx). Randomisation sequence concealment will include opaque_sealed envelopes with alphabetic codes whose distribution will be in control of an independent analyst. The envelopes will be opened; patient's data_slip will be pasted on them, and will be sent back to the control analyst. Blinding Strategy: The attending anaesthesiologist will be blinded to the intra_operative infusions used. Postoperative patient recovery profile will also be evaluated by an independent assess or blinded to the intra_operative anaesthesia technique. Management of Anaesthesia: Premedication All patients will be receive tablet ranitidine_150 mg night before and on morning of surgery.They will be instructed to fast for at least 8_ hours before surgery. Clear fluids will be allowed till 2 hours before surgery. Intra_operative Monitoring Two peripheral venous lines (18G/20G catheter) will be secured. Standard monitoring including 5_lead ECG, non_invasive blood pressure (NIBP), pulse oximeter, end_tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) and end_tidal gas monitoring will be applied. Additional monitoring will include depth of anaesthesia monitoring using Bi_spectral index (BIS) and neuromuscular monitoring using train_of_four response. Anaesthesia Technique 9270 x TBW (kg)/6680 + (216 x BMI) [men] 9270 x TBW (kg)/8780 + (244 x BMI) [women] Desflurane in oxygen_nitruos oxide mixture (FiO2 0.50) will be used for maintenance in both the groups to maintain a BIS of 40_60. Intra_operative muscle relaxation will be maintained using atracurium boluses controlled by train_of_four response on peripheral neuromuscular monitor. Thirty minutes before the end of surgery, non_opioid analgesics, such as paracetamol 1_gm will be administered to the patient. Desflurane delivery will be stopped at the point of completion of skin closure. Residual neuromuscular blockade (assessed with train_of_four response) will be reversed with neostigmine (50_µg/kg) and glycopyrrolate (20_µg/kg). After discontinuation of anaesthesia delivery (0_time point) the time to eye opening and time to extubation will be determined. After tracheal extubation the patients will be shifted to postoperative recovery room adjoining OT suites and will be closely observed for oxygenation and ventilation status, pain (visual analogue score [VAS]), sedation (Modified OASS), and PONV. 'Rescue' pain relief drug will include: diclofenac sodium 75 mg slow IV bolus for NRS>3 and 'rescue' antiemesis agent would be ondansetron 4_mg for a PONV score > 1. All patients will be pre_oxygenated with 100% oxygen for at least 3_minutes prior to induction of anaesthesia. All the drugs (study + control) will be administered based on lean body weight (LBW). Patients in the KF group will receive pre_induction fentanyl_citrate l_µg/kg IV and ketamine 0.5_mg/kg after induction whereas patien s in the Fentanyl group will receive pre_induction fentanyl_citrate l_µg/kg IV and saline as in above group. Anaesthesia will be induced with propofol 2_2.5mg/kg titrated to a BIS_value of 50.. After induction of anaesthesia, atracurium besylate 0.5_mg/kg will be administered for skeletal muscle relaxation to facilitate tracheal intubation. Ventilator settings for CMV, tracheal tube size [7.5_mm I.D (male), 6.5_mm I.D (female)], and breathing circuit (circle_CO2 absorber system) will be the standardised in all the patients. The patients in the Ketamine + Fentanyl group will receive fentanyl infusion at 0.5_mcg/kg/hr and ketamine infusion of 0.2_mg/kg/hr. The patients in the Fentanyl group will receive fentanyl infusion at 0.5_mcg/kg/hr and saline infusion. The LBW in obesity patients scheduled to undergo bariatric surgery will be calculated based on the following formulae: Intravenous Patient Controlled Analgesia (IV_PCA) pump containing fentanyl citrate_2.5 mcg/ml will be attached to all the patients upon shifting to the recovery room. The IV_PCA pump settings will be as follows: 0_ml basal dose; 4_ml PCA dose; 15_minutes lock out interval. A baseline visual analogue scoring will be done after shifting the patient to the recovery room (0_time point) followed by 2_hours, 4_hours, 8_hours, 12_hours, and 24_hours time points from the baseline. Any adverse effects such as hypotension/ hypertension, bradycardia/tachycardia, hypoxemia, giddiness will be recorded and treated. Post_surgery, time to alimentation post surgery will be noted."
Nct	Anaesthesia for Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy	2017		CN-01561478	"After obtaining the ethics committee approval of El Menoufia University hospital and the informed written consent from the patients, a hundred morbidly obese patients scheduled for sleeve gastrectomy were recruited for the study. Patients with history of cardiac comorbidity, chronic obstructive lung disease, drug abuse, expected difficult intubation patients, and patients with history of allergy to the study drugs were excluded from the study. Patients from 30 to 50 years old of both sexes were randomly allocated using computerized software into two groups, fifty patients in each group. Patients in inhalation group received intra_operative inhalational anaesthetic while patients in TIVA group received TIVA for anaesthetic maintenance. All patients received a routine premedication with oral sodium citrate 15ml [0.3 molar (1.16gm)] and intravenous (IV) 4mg ondansetron fifteen minutes before induction. Patients in both groups were connected to the routine monitoring and bispectral index (BIS) upon arrival to theatre. Anaesthesia induction for both groups was carried out by 0.5_1 mcg kg _1 remifentanil, 2_3mg kg_1 propofol, and 0.6 mg kg_1 rocuronium. Endotracheal intubation was done with the appropriate tube size. In the inhalational group, anaesthesia was maintained by desflurane in low flow oxygen air mixture 60/40%. In the TIVA group, anaesthesia was maintained using propofol 8_12 mg kg_1 h_1 and dexmedetomidine 0.5_1ugkg_1h_1. Remifentanil infusion of 0.05_2 µg kg__min__ was administered for both groups. Muscle relaxation was maintained in both groups by rocuronium infusion at a rate of 10_12ug kg1min_1. Depth of anaesthesia was monitored by bispectral index and anaesthetics were adjusted in both groups to obtain BIS of 40 to 60 by giving boluses of 0.5ug kg_1 remifentanil. The total boluses of intra_operative remifentanil were recorded. At the end of the procedure all patients received 0.6mg atropine and sugammadex 16mg kg_1 to reverse the effect of rocuronium. Patients were extubated and transferred to the post_anaesthetic care unit (PACU). Post_operative pain was monitored using visual analogue score (VAS) at PACU. Morphine sulphate 2 to 3 mg was given if the VAS was > 4. Intravenous paracetamol 1gm and/or ketorolac 30 mg were given eight hourly intravenously if needed (VAS ³3). Post_operative ondansetron 4mg every eight hours was given if required. Haemodynamics including heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) were recorded as a baseline and every fifteen minutes intra_operatively. Recovery time from anaesthesia using Aldrete score was recorded (the time from cessation of all anesthetics until complete recovery). 10 The incidence of post_operative nausea and vomiting, post_operative analgesic requirements, and the duration of PACU stay were recorded. Post_operative pain assessment using VAS from 0 to 10, where 0 means no pain and 10 is the worst pain the patient experienced. VAS was recorded at full recovery, every 15 minutes in PACU until discharge PACU. Time of onset of post_operative bowel movement was recorded. Statistical analysis: Sample size calculation was calculated using Graphed Instant statistics version 3. Based on the previous, studies propofol was expected to produce a drop in the MABP after induction of anaesthesia by about 10 mmHg with a standard deviation of 15 mmHg so by choosing level of significance 0.05 and power of 90%; the calculated sample size was 48 patients so that the number of patients randomized in each group was fifty patients to ensure reliable results. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS 19 (SPSS Inc, IBM company, Chicago,USA). The patients' sex, American society of anaesthetists (ASA) status and incidence of side effects were analyzed using the chi_square _2_test. Other parameters were compared using student t_test. For comparisons within the same group, paired t_test was used where for comparisons between groups; unpaired t_test was used. P_value less than 0.05 was considered statistic lly significant."
Nct	Effects of Mechanical Ventilation Guided by Transpulmonary Pressure on Gas Exchange During Robotic Surgery: a Pilot Study	2017		CN-01494177	"INTRODUCTION Laparoscopy and robotic techniques are widespread procedures for pelvic gynecologic, urologic and abdominal surgery often performed in Trendelenburg position. Furthermore, in order to ameliorate surgical procedures, pneumoperitoneum is applied by inflating carbon dioxide. However, the rise in abdominal pressure following pneumoperitoneum and the head down body position have been shown to impair the respiratory function during the procedure, mainly inducing atelectasis formation in the declive lung regions. Consequently, functional residual capacity decreases and the risk of perioperative complications, such as hypoxaemia, rises up, particularly if patients are obese. Formation of atelectasis may worsen stress and strain of the alveolar structure. Stress, strain and atelectrauma give rise to ventilator_induced lung injury. Although the role of ventilator_induced lung injury during general anesthesia is unclear, several investigations have been conducted with the purpose of improving arterial oxygenation and respiratory mechanics during laparoscopy. A ventilator strategy providing positive end_expiratory pressure (PEEP) has been shown to reduce the diaphragm cranial shift, increasing functional residual capacity and decreasing respiratory system elastance, principally in the obese subjects. Furthermore, the application of recruiting maneuver followed by the subsequent application of PEEP improved oxygenation during laparoscopy. Cinnella et al. demonstrated that an open lung strategy, i.e. a ventilation supported by recruiting maneuvers followed by the subsequent application of PEEP applied after pneumoperitoneum induction, increased transpulmonary pressure and led to alveolar recruitment and improvement of elastance of chest wall and gas exchange. These results are in accordance with finding by Talmor et al, evaluating the effect of a mechanical ventilation guided by esophageal pressure in acute lung injury patients. However a comparison between an esophageal pressure piloted mechanical ventilation and a conventional low tidal ventilator strategy with adjunct of PEEP and recruitment maneuvers according to clinical judgment has never been investigated in patients undergoing robotic gynecologic, abdominal or urologic surgery. Aim The investigators aim to compare the conventional ventilation strategy (i.e., with application of PEEP and recruitment manoeuvre) with a ventilation driven by transpulmonary pressure assessed through an esophageal catheter, in patients undergoing to robotic surgery, with respect to oxygenation, expressed in terms of arterial oxygen tension _ inspired oxygen fraction ratio (PaO2/FiO2) (primary endpoint), intraoperative respiratory mechanics indexes, number of lung recruitment maneuvers, rate and type of perioperative complications until hospital discharge (additional endpoint). METHODS Patients For this protocol, after informed consent has been obtained, 26 patients will be enrolled in the pilot randomized interventional study, eligible for robotic gynecological, urological and abdominal surgery at Maggiore Hospital Novara Italy. 1. The inclusion criteria will be: minimum age 18 years old, ASA I_II. 2. The exclusion criteria are: pre_existing lung and cardiac conditions that may lead to asa> II, contraindications to the positioning of a naso_gastric tube. 1. Control group: 13 ventilated patients in Volume controlled VT 6_8 ml / kg; PEEP, and Fio2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) set for SpO2> or = to 94%, Plateau pressure <28 cm H2O. Safety criteria In the intervention group in case of SpO2< to 94%, alveolar recruitment maneuvers will be applied. These measurement will be will be performed at: 9) 1h after recovery from anesthesia (STEP 8). With the patient awake (i.e.before and after surgery), a lung ultrasound will be carried out to evaluate the degree of ventilation / atelectasis . Intervention After the induction of general anesthesia, a naso_gastric tube equipped with gastric and esophageal balloon will be inserted (Nutrivent¨ _ Seda). The nasogastric tube wi l be positioned and the esophageal balloon will be calibrated according to the findings by Mojoli et al. In this phase, all patients will be ventilated a tidal volume (VT) of 6_8 ml / kg, in a volume controlled mode; PEEP (positive end_expiratory pressure) equal to zero and FiO2 set to obtain peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) > or = to 94% . The respiratory rate will be set to obtain arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) values between 35 and 45 mmHg and to ensure a physiological pH. At most, both a mild hypercapnia and a mild acidosis will be allowed. In all the patients radial artery will be cannulated to monitor continuous intra_arterial blood pressure as usual practice, after Allen test results positive. The invasive hemodynamic monitoring will be performed through MOSTCARETM technology. Subsequently, pneumoperitoneum will be applied to the patients, and the final position on the surgical table will be guaranteed. At this point, a recruitment maneuver will be applied, i.e., the ventilator is switched to pressure control ventilation, inspiratory time is increased to 50%, the peak inspiratory pressure gradient (above PEEP) is set at 20 cm H2O, and PEEP is progressively increased to obtain a stepwise increase of peak inspiratory to 30, 35, and 40 cm H2O every three breaths. The final recruiting pressure of 40 cm H2O is applied for six breaths. after recruiting maneuver ventilator is switched to previous ventilation mode. This maneuver is normally used to distend the lungs and prevent atelectasis . Then, patients will be randomized into two groups according to a randomization list generated by a dedicated software. Clinician, at the surgical table, will open a sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelope to allocate the patient according to the randomization group. A researcher, not involved in the clinical care of the patient, will keep the randomization list. Patients will be randomized into: 2. Case group: 13 ventilated patients with current volume VT 6_8 ml / kg and in any case with a transpulmonary inspiratory pressure (PLinsp) of less than 20 cmH2O and transpulmonary expiratory pressure (PLexp) _ FiO2, according to predefined criteria. In both groups the respiratory rate will be set to obtain PaCO2 values between 35 and 45 mmHg and in any case to ensure a physiological pH. In addition, whenever the clinician will deem it appropriate, an alveolar recruitment maneuver will be applied, as previously described, in order to improve the PaO2 / FiO2 relationship. Measurements During the study the following parameters will be recorded: arterial blood gas, respiratory mechanics parameters (airway pressure, tidal volume, transpulmonary pressure, flow, esophageal pressure),peritoneal insufflation pressure. 1) 15 min after induction of anesthesia (STEP 1) 2) immediately after the positioning of the patient and / or the pneumoperitoneum induction (STEP 2) 3) immediately after the recruitment maneuver (STEP 3) 4) 20 minutes after the application of the ventilatory strategy select with the randomization (STEP 4) 5) after 60 minutes from the application of the ventilatory strategy select with the randomization (STEP 5) 7) every 60 minutes from the last step (STEP 6) 8) at the end of surgery after the elimination of the pneumo_peritoneum and / or in the supine position (STEP 7). Statistical analysis For this pilot randomized study, was calculated a sample size of 26 patients in total i.e., 13 patients per arm . To determine sample size, the investigators expected a difference of 80 mmHg between the mean value of PaO2/FiO2 of the two groups and a standard deviation of 60 mmHg, with a power of 80% and an alpha of 0.05. The continuous variables will be presented as the median and interquartile and will be compared using the Mann Whitney test. Categorical variables, whether dichotomous or nominal, will be evaluated with a Fisher test. A trend analysis will be carried out within each group over the course of each step."
Nct	Evaluation of the Plant-based Approaches to Stop Obesity Diet for the Treatment of Overweight and Obesity	2018		CN-01661633	"The accumulation of excess of body weight is one of the most important problems worldwide, thus effective and accessible treatments are required. Some authors highlighted that treatment is focused solely on lifestyle (diet, physical activity, behavioral therapy) has a limited effect on body weight because it does not consider the biological mechanisms linked to weight loss in patients with obesity. On the other hand, drugs and bariatric surgery consider these biological approaches; however, its costs, safety and effectiveness limits its use on a large scale. Research studies support the existence of compounds in plants (such as epigallocatechin gallate, caffeine, cinnamaldehyde, fiber), and water with biological properties that would contribute to the treatment of overweight and obesity. However, at the moment, these compounds have only been evaluated individually and their effects have been significant but limited clinically, therefore, more research studies are needed to evaluate whether several of these compounds contained in common plants synergistically have a clinical impact on the management of overweight and obesity. The present work integrates diverse plant_based approaches to stop obesity and it is compared with a control group and a waiting list group. The main aim is to evaluate the efficacy of the Plant_based Approaches to Stop Obesity diet (PASO diet) compared with a control group on body weight at 3 months in Mexican adults with overweight and obesity. This is a pilot study designed as a randomized controlled trial. The study will be conducted with a (n=36). The primary outcome is the change in body weight from baseline to 3 months. Secondary outcomes will be the changes from baseline to 3 months in body mass index, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, symptoms of depression, quality of life scales and biochemical parameters (fasting glucose, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL_cholesterol, triglycerides and gamma glutamyl transferase). Additionally two 24_hour dietary recall will be measured at baseline and 3 months to evaluate adherence to the intervention."
Nct	Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy and Lifestyle Modification for the Treatment of Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis	2018		CN-01661130	"The pilot study proposed in this protocol will determine whether patients with a BMI of 30_39.9 kg/m2 will consent to liver biopsy, accept randomization to VSG, participate in lifestyle modification for a one_year period and consent to a paired liver biopsy at 12 months. Sixty candidates will be biopsied with 42 randomizations within the first year yielding 19 (including dropouts) participants/group. This should be sufficient to further estimate meaningful differences in liver histology given the estimated weight loss of lifestyle modification with and without VSG and a correlation of percent weight loss and histological score improvement over the short term (12 months). Determining the impact of the VSG is essential for expanding the traditional indications for bariatric surgery and thus, broadening the potential impact of this pilot study. Participants meeting study entry criteria are randomized with equal probability to one of two study groups: (1) Lifestyle modification (LSM) or (2) Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy (VSG + LSM) with Iifestyle modification, followed for 12 months. The primary goal for the trial is to determine if we can recruit, randomize, and retain participants to perform invasive and non_invasive measurements of NASH and fibrosis, deliver lifestyle modification and demonstrate the safety of VSG. The investigators wish to also understand which of these two interventions is more effective in achieving, 12 months after entry into the trial, a reduction in NAS composed of the non_weighted scores: (1) steatosis 0_3 (2) Inflammation 0_3 and (3) ballooning 0_2. Secondary goals include comparing the two treatment groups for changes in other measured outcomes including MRI assessments of intrahepatic triglyceride and liver elasticity and serum markers. As a pilot study, a sample size of 19 in each group should offer significant information as to the difference in NAS score reduction between to two groups and achieve adequate power to distinguish clinically significant changes in the primary and secondary outcome measures. These data support the overarching objective i.e. to provide evidence that a larger, longer_term clinical outcomes trial is feasible. A goal is for a longer term follow up for 5 years to assess the durability of treatment effects and treatment differences. The investigators will screen patients by telephone between the ages of 40 and 67 with a self_reported BMI of 30_39.9 kg/m2, a history of prediabetes, or type 2 diabetes. Prospective participants will be asked to provide a copy of their most recent liver chemistries to see if the AST or ALT fall in the inclusion range. The investigators will screen for a history of alcohol or other substance abuse and a surgical history that would preclude a safe VSG. Prospective participants will be invited to attend a seminar. They will be instructed to keep a food and exercise log for two weeks and return for a second visit. After consent is signed, during the eligibility review period participants will have their height and weight recorded, history reviewed, liver function tests, HbA1c, a urine sample, a basic metabolic profile, and INR will be obtained at this time and the participant will be referred for a liver biopsy. If the biopsy is consistent with NASH with a NAS >=5, then the participant will undergo MRI assessment and serum markers for inflammation. Vital signs (pulse, temperature, respiration, blood pressure, weight and BMI) will be obtained at each study visit. Participants will then begin an 800 calorie per day diet for 7 days during which they will receive their randomization assignment to VSG or not; all participants will receive lifestyle modification as the investigators need to see if surgery can provide any additional benefit to lifestyle modification. A basic metabolic panel will be performed at the conclusion of the 800 calorie diet. VSG will be performed laparoscopically and the greater curvature resected 6 cm for the pylorus to the angle of His over a 40 French Bougie. Lifestyle modification can begin immedi tely after surgery, though the VSG participants will not have calorie limits until 6 months after surgery. Participants will be seen regularly by the hepatologist and surgeon at 1 week, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months. Lifestyle modification will be overseen by Nancy Sherwood, Ph.D. Lifestyle will be delivered on an individual basis once per week for the first 6 months, twice per month for the next 3 months, and monthly up to one year. Vitamins A, B1, B12 and D and a comprehensive metabolic panel including liver chemistries will be performed at 3 months and 12 months in both groups. At 12 months a repeat liver biopsy will be performed (participants will have the opportunity to select an alternative approach if they did not have a good experience with the initial liver biopsy in order to ensure a paired specimen). This decision will be made in conjunction with the interventional radiologist. MRI for steatosis and elasticity will be performed and serum inflammatory and fibrosis markers will be obtained at 12 months as well as the collection of another urine sample. Participants will exit the study but will continue usual care after 12 months. We will create a biorepository for stool samples to measure the microbiome and for remaining liver tissue to measure the transcriptome."
Nct	High Versus Low Positive End Expiratory Pressure With Alveolar Recruitment Maneuver in Laparoscopic Bariatric Surgeries	2018		CN-01568292	"The use of a alveolar recruitment maneuver(RM) effectively increases end expiratory lung volume and reopens lung atelectasis during anesthesia and reproduces better oxygenation for surgical obese patients .Alveolar recruitment maneuver with PEEP could decreases atelectasis and improved oxygenation in obese surgical patients .This concept indicate that the maintenance of low PEEP after multiple alveolar recruitment maneuver during anesthesia may improve its benefits without complications. Patients will randomly divided by computerized randomization sequence method into two groups (30 patients in each study group): Both groups receive volume controlled ventilation, tidal volume was 6_8 ml/kg for predicted body weight. The PBW calculated according to a formula: 50 + 0.91 _ {height (cm)_152.4} for men and 45.5 + 0.91 _ {height (cm) _ 152.4} for women. The respiratory rate was adjusted to keep the EtCO2= 35_40 mmHg. The inspiratory to expiratory ratio (I:E ratio) was 1:2 and the FiO2 was 0.40. Low PEEP+RM group: Patients receive PEEP of 5cmH2O. Recruitment maneuver ( RM) will be done by increasing the PEEP in stepwise manner. First PEEP was increased to 10 cmH2O (3 breaths),then to 15 cm H2O (3 breaths).Finally, PEEP was raised to 20 cmH2O (10 breaths).Then decreased for 15cmH2O for (3 breaths),10cmH2O for(3 breaths), and finally returned back to original PEEP 5 cmH2O.The total procedure took 2 min. Recruitment will be carried out at the following times: post intubation(T1) , after peritoneal insuflation(T2) ,after desuflation (T3) and before extubation(T4) . The peak airway pressure should not exceed 40cmH2O. High PEEP group: Patients receive throughout ventilation 15 cm H2O PEEP with maintaining the peak airway pressure below 40 cm H2O.

Nct	Efficacy of a Didactic Intervention in Anticoagulated Patients (TAOPE Study)	2018		CN-01662645	"Background and current status: It has been proved that oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) is effective in preventing situations with high risk of thromboembolic events and in treating them. It significantly decreases ischemic stroke rates as well as their severity and death risk. However it is a therapy with special features, highlighting: doses and response variability, the close therapeutic range, interactions with other drugs and foods, and potentially severe side effects. This fact compels the investigators to make a close monitoring of those patients. An important impact in developing cardioembolic or hemorrhagic events due to a inappropriate coagulation control using vitamin K antagonists (VKA), has been described; because of control variations around 15% could result in so relevant clinical problems. The main OAT indications are deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, embolic conditions prevention in patients suffering from atrial fibrillation or heart prosthetic valve wearers. Most common embolic event is ictus, which could lead to an important inability and dependence state, what would associate a significant increase in health resources use and costs. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is nowadays the pathology which requires most anticoagulant therapy indications. This fact is partially due to the population aging, since there are both incidence and prevalence increases of this arrhythmia, specially in elderly patients. Control of patients on OAT were performed in hospitals until a few years ago; nevertheless, changes in social and healthy contexts besides the expansion in this drugs prescribing joined to primary health care qualification and evolution, the development of coagulation handheld measuring devices and the need to improve patients accessibility, had justified the control decentralization and due to this facts, OAT monitoring can be practiced to stable patients on primary care. When the need of receiving anticoagulation has been stablished, this could be implemented basically using heparin or vitamin_K antagonists or coumadin or new direct action oral anticoagulants as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban or edoxaban. The prothrombin time measuring standardization using international normalized ratio (INR) allows the investigators to obtain reliable results in different laboratories. The development of coagulation handheld measuring devices to match INR in capillary blood with high sensitivity and reliability, has made that possible patients on anticoagulant therapy can be controlled on primary care. This allow the investigators a comprehensive approach and control of these patients. Educational and behavioural interventions could improve VKA anticoagulated patients ability to keep an INR appropriate control using their progresses in knowledge and understanding of the action mechanisms of anticoagulants drugs. A recent research included in Cochrane regarding to those interventions notes that education is particularly important to provide information about safety for patients suffering AF on OAT and let patients to take their own well founded decisions about treatment options and to manage their OAT. However, it could be inferred there are not enough evidences to stablish definite conclusions about educational health interventions impact in INR behaviour in patients suffering from AF on OAT. Therefore, in these three research articles recently conducted in Spain with patients on VKA, it can be observed an inappropriate anticoagulation control. METHODS: The investigators performed a randomized clinical trial over a period of 12 months. Study area: one healthcare area in Malaga (Spain) where 741.000 inhabitants from rural or urban population are cared for. It is organized in 33 primary care centers and 19 local doctor«s offices. In the investigators environment, patients who initiate treatment with VKA are trained at their hematology units until they get a suitable INR level control. After that, patients are followed and evaluated in primary care. The amount of patients with AF on anticoagulation with VKA is high, however, INR levels control results are not ideal. On the other hand, it should be noted that these chronic patients use to suffer many other conditions and they usually take a lot of medication which makes improve of education aspects aimed at self care and effective health self_management which is absolutely necessary. Selfcare support programs are presented as a tool to accomplish a change in paternalistic method to other one in which citizens could receive more information about their health state (this fact is in accordance with people requests, demonstrated by a rise in the internet consulting about health issues). ""Expert patients"" programs, in which instructors are patients with chronic conditions similar to those who receive the training and so they could play a role model, occupying a prominent place inside the selfcare educational initiatives set. Through the present research the investigators try to show that an organised group educational intervention, conducted by using School for Patients method on VKA anticoagulated patients is able to improve inappropriate INR levels control. Study population: patients on OAT program receiving VKA presenting inappropriate INR levels control and belonging to four primary care centers. Setting the limits and justification of the sample size: Total population from the health centers which take part in the study amount to approximately 50.000 inhabitants. Step I: If it is taken into account that prevalence of patients on OAT is about 1.5% of general population, it can be claimed that target population to initiate the study will be 750 anticoagulated patients. It has been observed in previous researches that at least 33% of these patients would not have an appropriate INR level control. In order to reach an accuracy about 4% in the estimate proportion using a normal asymptotic confidence interval with a correction to finite populations on bilaterally 95% and assuming that expected population is about 33% and population total size is 750, it will be necessary to include 311 experimental units in this study. Step II: If it is accepted an alfa risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.20 in a bilateral contrast between study group and control group, 312 individual will be required (156 in each group) to detect differences equal or higher than 15% between both groups in primary target. It has been estimated a tracking loss rates of 10%. It will be assumed as losts those individual impossible to be located, or those who do not accept to take part or those who do not attend to scheduled revisions, in accordance to the study intervention plan, as well as deceases occurring within six months since the intervention. Given the relevant impact of the development of cardioembolic or hemorrhagic events due to inappropriate INR control, changes about 15% could have great clinical relevance. Variables. Operative definition The main variable to assess in this study is time on INR therapeutic levels in the last six months receiving VKA treatment. Appropriate INR level control will be assessed in two ways: measuring the therapeutic INR values percentages or Time percentages in therapeutic values estimated using Rosendaal method. It supposes to record the figure of INR value and the date in which the test was carried out. The therapeutic INR values percentages are defined by their acceptable values according to the pathology the patient suffers. It used to be from 2 to 3 if it is about atrial fibrillation or from 2.5 to 3.5 if thromboembolism prevention is carried out after a heart valve surgery has been performed. So, this quantitative variable has to be measured to calculate patients percentage on appropriate range, according to the patient condition. Independent variables also called study variables are those which could affect to result variable. The investigators are going to classify them in eight groups to make easier their analysis. Sociodemographic: age and gender. Somatometry and vital signs: Body mass index (BMI), diastolic and systolic blood pressure, and heart rate. Cardiovascul r risk factors: smoking habit, diabetes, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia and chronic renal failure. Cardiovascular conditions: atrial fibrillation (AF), interventional cardiac valve diseases with or without AF, ischemic cardiopathy, thromboembolic diseases history (stroke, transient ischemic attack), hemorrhagic stroke, congestive heart failure. Blood test: Glomerular filtration rates, total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. They will be obtained from the last blood test carried out to the patient. Use of accompanying medication: total number of drugs, anticoagulant type. Consumption of ""gastric protector"". Dietary habits: usual consumption of food rich in vitamin K, alcohol consumption. Data collecting: All variables detailed previously were collected as long as they were suitable in digital medical history or it could be directly obtained from the patient during the medical interview, without the need of changing health center usual clinical practice, over the 6 months prior to the intervention. First step: patients on OAT program enrolled in several primary health centers belonging to a healthcare area of Mlaga were evaluated at the study moment attending to their clinical characteristics. The measurements obtained from the digital clinical history in the last six months before the beginning of the study were recorded, as well as the rest of variables. Second step: Once the study of the VKA anticoagulation control degree has been performed, patients on inappropriate control were selected. A list of patients with deficient INR control in participant health centers was made. It was considered an inappropriate INR control when the therapeutic INR values percentages was less than 65%, using Rosendaal method to obtain them. In case of no availability, INR control was considered inappropriate when therapeutic INR values percentage resulted less than 60%. In any of the assumptions, the assessment period was at least the last six months."
Nct	The Influence of Food Matrix Delivery System on the Bioavailability of Vitamin D3	2018		CN-01918699	"BACKGROUND The current project is a part of the vitamin D fortification with enhanced bioavailability study program (acronym: DFORT) which is an interdisciplinary project including research groups from Denmark, Spain, and the Netherlands supported by the Danish Innovation Foundation. The overall aim of DFORT is to develop more efficient strategies for vitamin D fortification by studying the influence of the delivery matrix on the bioavailability of vitamin D. DFORT is organized into four scientific work packages (WP). The first two WPs have aimed to study whether complex formation (nano_encapsulation) of vitamin D with different proteins may enhance the stability of vitamin D (WP 1 lead by prof. Daniel Otzen, AU_iNANO) and the effect of complex formation in real food systems including investigations on the stability during storage, light_ and heat_exposure (WP 2 lead by associate professor Trine Kastrup Dalsgaard, AU_FOOD). WP 1+2 have shown that vitamin D can be stabilized by complex formation with whey protein and that the encapsulation may cause less oxidative degradation thereby improving the stability of vitamin D in different food systems. In the current study (WP 3 lead by prof. Lars Rejnmark, AU_Health), the bioavailability of vitamin D in different food matrices (including complex formation with whey protein) will be studied in humans. Biological samples will be collected in WP 3 allowing for metabolomics studies on possible associations between vitamin D supplementation through different food matrices and metabolic phenotype (WP 4 lead by prof. Hanne C. Bertram, AU_FOOD). Although most of the total body vitamin D is synthesized in the skin after exposure to UV light (wavelength of 290_315 nm), most individuals require at least some dietary vitamin D to maintain a replete vitamin D status. This is especially true during wintertime. With a latitude of 56¡N in Denmark, there is no endogenous synthesis of vitamin D in the months extending from October to April, which means that the inhabitants have to rely on food sources in order to maintain a replete vitamin D status. Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3 [D3]) is the main dietary source of vitamin D, but it is only present in a limited number of food items (such as fatty fish) making it difficult to achieve the recommended intake of 10 µg D3 per day. Vitamin D status may be improved in response to an increased intake of vitamin D in terms of either supplementation with tablets or food fortification. Numerous studies have shown increased 25_hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) levels in response to an increased intake of vitamin D. It is generally assumed that mean 25OHD concentrations increase by 0.7 nmol/L in response to an increased long_term intake of 1 µg vitamin D per day although the relative increase per microgram supplemented may be higher if baseline levels are low. Despite this well_known dose_response relationship in groups of people, several studies have documented that the change in serum 25OHD levels in response to vitamin D supplementation varies widely. Several reasons may account for the inter_individual variation in response to vitamin D supplementation. In gross terms, the variation may be due to dosing inaccuracies (inconsistencies between claimed and actual values of vitamin D) and variation in bioavailability of vitamin D. Co_primary (null_) hypothesis: _ The food matrix by which D3 is delivered does not affect Cmax of D3 as determined 10h post_dosing. _ The absorption profile (time_concentration curve in terms of Area Under the Curve from 0h to 12h [AUC0_12h]) does not differ according to the food matrix by which D3 is delivered. Secondary (null_)hypotheses _ Compared with vitamin D provided as droplets, the absorption of D3 is not enhanced by delivery through each of the tested food matrices (i.e., increased Cmax). Inconsistencies between claimed and measured values of vitamin D content in vitamin D tablets and food_fortified products may be due to inconsistencies in dose used for fortification or to the instability of the vitamin per se. Discrepant results have been reported on the stability of vitamin D in different food matrices and when exposed to different physiochemical hazards. Some investigators have reported vitamin D to be unstable whereas others have found it to be remarkable stable when exposed to oxidation, light, and to acid and alkali. Only few studies have searched for factors responsible for the inter_individual variation in 25OHD levels in response to vitamin D supplementation. These studies have suggested that body composition (including fat mass content), genetic variants of the vitamin D binding protein (VDBP), and the ratio of serum 24,25_dihydroxy vitamin D (24,25(OH)2D) to 25OHD may contribute to variation in serum 25OHD levels. However, in a recent study only 47% of the variations in the response to vitamin D supplementation could be explained by accounting for factors of known importance to changes in 25OHD levels. In addition to the above_mentioned indices, factors of importance to the intestinal absorption of vitamin D as well as the food matrix by which vitamin D supplementation is provided may contribute to inter_individual variations in 25OHD responses. However, only few studies are available on the bioavailability of vitamin D from different food matrices and the intestinal absorption of vitamin D, including the intraluminal fate, and molecular mechanisms facilitating the absorption are still only partially understood. As vitamin D is a fat_soluble molecule, it has generally been assumed that vitamin D is absorbed in the small intestine by simple passive diffusion with vitamin D being incorporated into the micelle and transported by chylomicrons via lymph veins to the liver. This is in alignment with studies showing an increased risk of low 25OHD levels in patients with fat malabsorption. Accordingly, it has been suggested that ingestion of vitamin D with a meal rich in fat may increase the release of bile, allowing an increased incorporation of vitamin D in the bile salt micelle thereby improving the bioavailability of vitamin D. However, discrepant results have been reported, on whether the composition of the food matrices (and its fat content) by which vitamin D is ingested influence its bioavailability. In a randomized, controlled trial by Raimundo et al., the mean change in 25OHD levels two weeks after the treatment with a single large oral dose of 50,000 IU D3 was larger, when the meal had at least 15 g of fat compared to a fat_free meal. In contrast, the fat content of the food matrices was not found to influence the time_concentration profile as measured by vitamin D2 levels in plasma 2, 4, 8, 12, 48, and 72 h after ingestion of a single dose of 25,000 IU D2 added to either whole milk, skim milk or dissolved in 0.1 mL corn oil and applied to toast. However, both of these studies are limited by the use of very high (pharmacological) doses of vitamin D, which may override any physiological effects of the composition of the food matrices. _ Compared with vitamin D added to juice, the absorption of D3 is not enhanced by whey protein complex_bound D3 (i.e., increased Cmax). _ Treatments do not affect plasma levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and ionized calcium. _ The variability to vitamin D supplementation in terms of Cmax is lower if vitamin D is complex_bound to whey proteins as compared to the other tested supplementation methods. _ Arterial stiffness as assessed by tonometry is not affected by milk intake. MATERIALS AND METHODS The treatment sequences are: Treatment sequence 1: A B E C D A lack of an effect of the fat content of the food by which vitamin D is ingested is also supported by studies on vitamin D fortification of orange juice. Comparing the bioavailability of vitamin D added to orange juice or supplemented as capsules showed a similar increase in 25OHD concentrations in response to 11 weeks of supplementation with 1000 IU vitamin D per day and the increase was significant compared to placebo. The fact that vitamin D may be sufficiently absor ed following a fat_free meal (such as orange juice) may be explained by recent findings on the mechanism by which vitamin D is absorbed. It seems that vitamin D is not only absorbed by simple passive diffusion (by incorporation into the micelle), as cholesterol membrane transporters, such as SR_BI, CD36, or NPC1L1, have been shown to be involved in the absorption. Differences in expression levels and the existence of functional polymorphisms in the genes encoding these proteins may also contribute to the large inter_individual variation in postprandial responses to vitamin D. Only very few studies are available on the time_plasma concentration profile of vitamin D after intake of an oral dose. Denker et al. studied the pharmacokinetic profile of vitamin D3 after administration of a single D3 dose of either 2800 or 5600 IU, showing that plasma D3 levels increased steadily after the intake and peaked at 9±2.3 h with concentrations returning to near baseline values by 72 h. It is unknown whether the food matrix (including complex formation of vitamin D by encapsulation with whey proteins) affects the bioavailability of vitamin D as assessed by the plasma_time concentration profiles and whether this may influence the inter_individual variability in response to vitamin D supplementation. The importance of calcium intake, and especially calcium intake from milk products and tablets (supplements) has been investigated in a number of studies, showing discrepant results. A Cochrane meta_analysis has suggested an overall beneficial effect of increased calcium intake from milk products and calcium supplements. However, a recent trial has suggested an increase in blood pressure in the hours following intake of 1000 mg of calcium citrate compared with placebo. It has so far not been investigated whether milk intake causes similar effects on indices of cardiovascular health, including blood pressure and arterial stiffness. AIM The overall aim of the study is to investigate the influence of different food matrices (including complex_formation with whey proteins) on the bioavailability of vitamin D, as assessed by maximum concentration profiles (Cmax) and the time_concentration curve of D3 in plasma and thereby whether the inter_individual variation in the absorption of vitamin D may depend on delivery system. Explanatory hypotheses In order to allow for further investigations on indices of importance to responses to vitamin D supplementation, data will be collected on body composition, genetic polymorphisms, cholesterol status, and habitual dietary habits. STUDY DESIGN The study is performed as a multiple cross_over study using a balanced latin_square design. This design allows for each participant to function as her own control thereby counterbalancing risk of an adverse influence on results of the order of treatment or other factors such as effect of period, as well as inter_individual variations attributable to e.g., genetic variations, body weight etc. By randomization, each participant will be allocated to receive all the five treatment regimes in a pre_specified order with a 10_21 days wash_out period in_between each of the treatment arms. Treatment sequence 2: B C A D E Treatment sequence 3: C D B E A Treatment sequence 4: D E C A B Treatment sequence 5: E A D B C Treatment sequence 6: D C E B A Treatment sequence 7: E D A C B Treatment sequence 8: A E B D C Treatment sequence 9: B A C E D Treatment sequence 10: C B D A E PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING VITAMIN D SUPPLEMENTATION The supplement will be acquired commercially and stored at the Osteoporosis Clinic, Aarhus University Hospital and kept away from other medication and supplementation. Sub_investigator is responsible for correct handling and dispensing of vitamin D supplement, as well as securing that the supplement will only be used as described in the protocol and that the participants are instructed to take it correct. PROCEDURES FOR RANDOMIZATION Randomization will be done using a computer generate list. Treatments will not be blinded for the investigator. In terms of comparing juice with or without whey proteins bound_complexes, a single_blind design will be applied, as participants will not be told which of the treatments they are receiving. Each treatment sequence will be allocated to the same number of patients _ e.g. 3 participants will be in treatment sequence 1, 3 in treatment sequence 2 etc. POPULATION Thirty participants will be recruited from the general background population by direct mailing using a list of randomly selected individuals living in the area of Aarhus generated by ""Research services"" at Statens Serum Institut. The study will be performed during wintertime (November_April). WITHDRAWAL AND DROPOUT Any participant can at any point drop out of the study without any explanation and will not have to go through a final examination. The investigator can withdraw a participant if this seems necessary for the participant's safety. Dropouts and withdrawals will be noted and explained in the CRF. Withdrawal will happen in case of one of the following criteria is fulfilled: _ Change in vitamin D supplementation _ Ionized calcium ³1.40 mmol/L _ Disease or new medication that will influence the study _ Serious adverse effects/symptoms that is expected to be caused by vitamin D supplementation Diseases that occur within 7 days of treatments can be a possible cause of participation in the study. Sub_investigator can in this time frame be contacted in order to investigate whether it is a cause of the vitamin D supplementation. In case it is, the symptoms or disease will be followed until it is cured or have become chronic. EXAMINATIONS Participants will be examined 5 times over a time period of 6 to 12 weeks. At each visit, the participants will arrive fasting before 9am and will stay at the department until blood sampling at 12 hours is taken. Hereafter, the participants is free to go home and come back the following day for the 24 hours blood sampling and delivering the urine samples or stay the night at the hospital. During the 12 hours at the department, the participants will get standardized food. Basic health information and questionnaires: Participants will answer questionnaires regarding their general health as well as dietary habits and sun exposure. Biochemistry: Blood samples will be collected at different time points (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours). Urine samples: Urine will be collected in 3 batches at the first day of each dosing i.e., from 0_4 hours, from 4_8 hours and from 8_24 hours. All measurements will be performed when all material from all 30 participants have been collected. Bone scans: Dual_Energy X_ray absorptiometry (DXA) and High_Resolution peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (HRpQCT): Blood pressure measurements and tonometry: Blood pressure and measurements of arterial stiffness (tonometry) are performed twice in each participant in relation to treatment regimes ""C"" and ""D"". All measurements will be performed when all material from all 30 participants have been collected in order to avoid variation in results. Blood samples will be stored in a biobank for a maximum of 15 years after the end of the study. DXA scanning with the Hologic QDR Discovery scanner. Bone mineral density (BMD) will be measured in lumbar spine (L1_L4), femoral neck, and the distal forearm. Furthermore, total body composition will be determined, including fat_ and lean_tissue mass. A HRpQCT bone scan of the distal radius and tibia will be performed using an Xtreme CT_scanner (SCANCO Medical AG, Switzerland). This will allow for assessment of volumetric BMD for cortical and trabecular bone, bone structure and geometry (including cortical and trabecular thickness, trabecular separation etc.) and bone strength. On both occasions, measurements are performed in the morning with the participant in the fasting state. After the measurements are performed, the participant will be provided the intervention together with a breakfast meal. After this, the participant will be fasting until next measurement i performed four hours later. Office blood pressure (BP) is measured in a sitting position after 5 minutes of rest on the right upper arm using a digital automatic BP monitor. Three BP readings will be performed with 2 minutes of rest in_between. The average of the last two measurements is recorded. Arterial stiffness and pulse wave velocity (PWV) will be assessed by tonometry using the SphygmoCor system (Xcel; AtCor Medical, Sydney, NSW, Australia). For measurements of carotid_to_femoral PWV, an inflated femoral cuff placed on the right upper thigh combined with carotid applanation tonometry will be used. Measurements are performed in a quiet room. The participant will be resting for 10 minutes in a supine position prior to test start. Brachial BP is measured on the right upper arm and two consecutive BP readings are performed. If BP readings do not differ by > 5 mmHg, the last one is recorded. If BP readings differ by > 5 mmHg, four BP readings are obtained. The average of the last two measurements is recorded. AIx is assessed as the ratio of wave reflection amplitude to central pulse pressure. The mean of two measurements are used in the analyses. Carotid_femoral PWV is assessed as the distance travelled divided by the transit time using the direct carotid_to_cuff distance as measured with a non_stretchable tape (infantometer). A minimum of two measurements is performed. If measurements differs < 0.5 m/s the average of the two measurements is used for analyses. If PWV differs by > 0.5 m/s a third measurement is obtained and the median value is used for analyses. According to general recommendations, the direct carotid_to_cuff distance mean PWV is multiple with 0.8. PERSPECTIVES The study will provide insight into the bioavailability of vitamin D3 supplementation, including sources of variation. Since Denmark is a country with low latitude and high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and fortification of food items is not common or legislated, this study may lead to way to fortifying food items in Denmark."
Nct	The DNA-Based Lifestyle Enhancement Trial	2018		CN-01661027	"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, accounting for 17.9 million deaths and the loss of 348 million disability_adjusted life years in 2015 alone. Diabetes and obesity are very strong risk factors for CVD. Individuals with diabetes and obesity have an 82.75% life_time risk for developing CVD. While treatments do exist for both obesity (e.g. bariatric surgery) and diabetes (e.g. pharmaceutical control of blood sugar levels), these only partially attenuate risk of adverse health outcomes and they do not address prevention and upstream causes of cardiovascular diseases, namely sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy diet. Despite the known cardiovascular benefits of regular physical activity and having a balanced diet, it has proven challenging to change health behaviours towards favourable lifestyles. Indeed, the prevalence of obesity is increasing in Canada as less than 80% of adults follow the current recommendation of 150 minutes of moderate_to_vigorous physical activity per week and approximately less than 60% of adults consume fruits and vegetables 5 or more times a day. The overarching aim of the study is to test the effect of providing personalized genetic information along with diet and exercise plans on adherence to healthy lifestyle habits and cardio_metabolic risk. There is tremendous public interest in genetics and some evidence that providing genetic information can help improve health habits. However, no intervention to date has examined the effect of comprehensive genetic testing using cutting_edge polygenic score (PGS) prediction and an interactive health portal on health behaviours and cardio_metabolic risk. The investigators hypothesize that providing participants with detailed genetic information about genetic determinants of fitness and nutrition traits will help to motivate people to adopt healthy lifestyle habits. The primary objective is to test the effect of providing genetic information and interactive recommendations for diet and exercise on adoption of healthy behaviours. The secondary objective is to evaluate the effects of the personalized health recommendations on cardio_metabolic risk markers, such as dyslipidemia, inflammatory markers, and fasting glucose. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial investigating whether personalized lifestyle recommendations including genetic information motivates Hamilton Health Sciences employees to adopt healthy lifestyle changes. Study participation will be open to Hamilton Health Sciences employees. Recruitment will begin in March 2017. Eligible and consenting individuals will be enrolled. Enrollment will occur in a staggered fashion. The intervention group will receive (1) a free 3_month GoodLife Fitness gym membership providing access to any Ontario GoodLife Fitness facility, (2) professional trainer_approved workout plans, (3) dietitian_approved meal plans, and (4) genetic information pertaining to their health and fitness. The control group will also receive a GoodLife Fitness membership to ensure that all study participants are granted similar ease_of_access to perform physical activities and generic health recommendations (Canadian Food Guide / Health Canada Physical Activity Recommendations) but will not receive the personalized component of the intervention (workout plans, meal plans or genetic information) until the end of their trial period. Participants will be randomized to treatment or control groups using a minimization scheme for adaptive randomization, which will serve to balance age, gender, and ethnicity across groups as participants are enrolled. Thus, randomization will be performed in a single_blind fashion wherein the study team is unaware of whom is receiving the intervention or control. All study participants will be monitored over the course of 3 months beginning with their baseline assessment and ending with their 3_month follow_up assessment. At these two timepoints, study participants will be assessed for behavioural (physica activity levels and diet healthiness), fitness markers (blood pressure, resting heart rate, body fat %, and other anthropometric measurements) and biological markers (lipids, insulin sensitivity, and inflammation) of cardio_metabolic disease."
Nct	Restrictive or Doppler-guided Fluid Treatment in Colorectal Surgery	2018		CN-01663421	"Background Hypovolemia can cause postoperative complications, circulatory collapse and death, regardless if the cause is blood loss or loss of other fluids. Therefore, doctors are giving fluid intravenously to patients undergoing surgery, and often in an amount larger than the measured losses. Recent studies, however, have shown that also fluid overload plays a part in complication development after surgery (1_3). It is therefore important to find the optimal fluid treatment for surgical patients. In Denmark, approximately 3500 patients are undergoing surgery every year for colorectal cancer, and in addition, operations are performed for benign diseases. However, the complication rate after colorectal surgery remains high (approximately 30%). Disagreement about which fluid treatment is optimal exist between three ""schools for fluid therapy"": 1. ""Standard fluid therapy"" which in addition to replacing external fluid loss (blood loss, urine and evaporation) include fluid to replace a ""third space loss"" and fluid to counteract low blood pressure (4_5). Standard therapy is poorly defined and differ between hospitals. It cause a bodyweight increase by 3_6 kilo (6_7). 2. ""Goal_directed fluid therapy"", where volume is given in a bolus injection of a colloid (typically hydroxyethyl starch (HES)) in order to keep the patient's stroke volume (SV) at a near maximum level (1). The heart is brought close to maximum performance. In theory, hypovolemia is prevented and oxygen supply to the tissues increased. In the studies available, HES is given on top of ""standard therapy"" and ""Goal_directed fluid therapy"" therefore result in a weight gain not measured in the available studies. 3. ""Restrictive fluid therapy"", replace only measurable fluid losses and strive to maintain the patient's normal (preoperative) body weight. The hypothesis is that excess fluid cause interstitial edema which may be harmful to the healing of tissue and function. (2,3,8). ""Standard fluid therapy"" is meaningful if a benefit exists in giving fluid to a possible third space loss and treat the vasodilatation caused by epidural analgesia by volume. However, a recent critical review of the literature poses serious doubts about the existence of a third space loss (9), and no beneficial effect of volume treatment of the vasodilatation caused by epidural analgesia been shown. ""Goal_directed fluid therapy"" tests the hypothesis that a near maximal stroke volume (SV) during surgery improves tissue oxygen supply, thus preventing the harmful effects of hypovolemia. Unfortunately, all studies that have tested ""goal_directed fluid therapy"" with esophageal Doppler monitoring have chosen to use a not well_defined ""standard fluid regime"" as their control group, and in the intervention groups they have chosen to first provide ""standard fluid therapy"" and then give a further HES to maximum stroke volume (10_16). In addition, length of hospital stay (LOS) were the primary endpoint not morbidity or mortality, and patients were not followed after discharge. The results of these studies differ. Most studies have shown shorter LOS in the intervention group, but only 3 of the studies have been blinded (11, 13, 16). Some studies have shown a lower complication rate in the intervention groups (12, 13, 16) some studies have not shown a difference in complication rate (10, 14, 15, 17) and some have raised suspicions that the intervention has been harmful, with increased mortality (15, 18). ""Restrictive fluid treatment"" is based on the following logic: If there is no third space loss, it is pointless to give saline to replace it, and if epidural vasodilatation is not corrected with volume, it is pointless to give fluid to increase BP. The hypothesis is that fluid overload might result in interstitial edema, harmful to tissue healing and cardiovascular function. Only a few studies have tested the effect of ""restrictive fluid treatment"" on the development of complications following major surgical procedures, but the results have been consistent: ""Restrictive fluid treat ent"" has reduced the complication rate after elective abdominal surgery (2, 3). Purpose To investigate whether perioperative fluid therapy controlled by esophageal Doppler monitoring reduces postoperative complications compared to perioperative fluid therapy controlled by measuring external fluid loss and body weight. In addition, to investigate whether patients receiving ""restrictive fluid therapy"" develop hypovolemia with reduced SV during surgery. Design Clinical randomized double_blinded multicenter study, stratified for each center, and for laparoscopic and open surgery. This will result in a simultaneous stratification of combined epidural and general anesthesia (used in open surgery) and general anesthesia alone (as used in laparoscopic surgery). The patients are block randomized with a number of patients in each block unknown to the doctors performing the randomization. Several centers are participating to complete the trial within a reasonable time. The patients are following an enhanced recovery program in both arms. Material 150 patients undergoing elective colorectal resection will be included. The number was determined using data from complication databases, which shows a postoperative complication rate of approximately 30%. 2_ is set at 5% and _ is set at 15%, increasing the credibility of a possible negative result. A number of n > 67.5 patients in each group was calculated, and inclusion of 75 patients in each group (total 150 patients) was decided. Outcome The composite endpoint of mortality and postoperative complications is the primary endpoint. An event is accepted as a complication if it demands clinical treatment and fulfills given diagnostic criteria. Based on the following hypotheses; subgroup analysis are planned: Both hypovolemia and hypervolemia may be harmful to the cardiac function (low oxygen supply and congestion) and cause cardiovascular complications such as: ¥ Newly developed arrhythmias, AMI, pneumonia, pulmonary congestion, newly developed pleural exudation, pulmonary edema or ARDS. Both hypovolemia and hypervolemia may be harmful to tissue healing (low oxygen supply and interstitial edema) and cause complications related to tissue healing and infection: ¥ Infections of the wound, bursting of the wound (superficial and deep), leakage from the anastomosis and separation of a stoma. In addition, data for physiological changes in HR, BP, SV, Hemoglobin concentration, diuresis etc. will be analyzed. Method: A trial profile will account for all patients undergoing elective colorectal resections in the inclusion period. I.e. all patients undergoing elective colorectal resections must be consecutively screened for inclusion and asked to participate if no exclusion criteria is met. The information will take place the day before surgery. The information will be based on the written information (see appendix), and will be given in an easily understandable language and in an appropriate manner adapted to the individual. Patients are randomized to either ""restrictive fluid treatment"" (R group) or ""fluid treatment to maximum SV"" (SV group). Preoperative fluid treatment: All patients may drink until 2 hours before anesthesia. If supplemental intravenous fluids are needed, it is given in accordance with the loss, i.e.: Glucose isotonic (5%) replaces insensible perspiration (if diabetes insulin and if needed potassium is added). Registration of fluid intake begins at midnight on the day of the operation. Perioperative monitoring: Standard anesthesia monitoring as recommended by the Danish Anesthesiological Society is used. A catheter in the radial artery monitor the BP and is used for blood sampling. BP and HR are measured at least 3 times before induction of anesthesia and every five minutes during anesthesia. Immediately after the induction of anesthesia, all patients have a Doppler placed in the esophagus to measure the flow rate in the aorta, thereby calculating the stroke volume (SV). The SV is measured before surgery is started, and every 15 minutes throughout the operation. In the ""Rest ictive Group"", the Doppler measurements are recorded to a black box (see later). Anesthesia: Routine premedication is given. In open surgery, combined epidural and general anesthesia are used: The Epidural catheter is inserted at the Th8_Th10 level, tested, and a continuous infusion of Bupivacaine 0.5% is running until sufficient blockade. General anesthesia is induced with Thiopental / Propofol, Fentanyl and Rocuronium (Esmerone¨) for a neuromuscular blockade. Anesthesia is maintained with Sevoflurane / Fentanyl or Propofol / Remifentanil (Ultiva¨). For laparoscopic surgery, only general anesthesia is used. In case of conversion from laparoscopic to open surgery, an epidural catheter is placed postoperatively. Perioperative fluid treatment: If the preoperative fluid intake <500 ml. it is supplemented to 500 ml. with saline in both groups. In addition, saline is given with the medicine. Lost blood is replaced volume by volume with HES (Voluven ¨) with an allowance of 500 ml extra. In the SV group, a bolus injection of 200 ml Voluven¨ is given until the increase in SV is <10%. Blinding: Only the anesthesiologist know the randomization group and perioperative fluid treatment. It is unknown to the patient and to the project surgeon. As all patients in the study will receive NaCl 0.9%, Voluven ¨, and other IV fluids, and as all patients are monitored with a Doppler in the esophagus, effective blinding of the surgeons can be achieved. In order to avoid bias of the anesthesiologist, the SV measurements are recorded to a black box in the restrictive group. Postoperative fluid treatment: Throughout the rest of the day of the operation, fluid is given to meet the basic needs, i.e. approx. 1000 ml K_Na_glucose, K_glucose or glucose 5%. The patient is encouraged to drink and eat as soon as it is safe to swallow. Nutrition is started as soon as possible (preferably in recovery) with protein drinks. In the surgical department, fluid charts and weight changes, allowing a body weight increase of two kilograms without treatment, monitor fluid treatment. If the weight increases more than two kilogram, furosemide is given to increase the diuresis. The patient's body weight is measured in the morning before surgery, and then every morning until discharge or the seventh post_operative day. The same set of scales are used throughout the course. Blood tests: Venous blood is taken in the morning on the day of the operation and every morning the following 5 days or until the patient is discharged. Surgery: Patients are operated with either open or laparoscopic technique. Antibiotic prophylaxis follows the department's routine. The bowel is not cleansed except for an enema before rectal surgery. Postoperative analgesia: In open surgical procedures, continuous, patient_controlled, epidural analgesia is given for a maximum of 4 days. In addition 1 g Paracetamol is given x 3_4, and / or Ibuprofen 400 mg x 3_4 if there are no contraindications. Supplemental Morphine p.n. is allowed. Nausea is treated with Ondansetron, Metoclopramide or DHB, depending on the cause of the patient's nausea. In case of suspicion of ventricular retention, a ventricular tube is applied for suction. Data collection The project doctor or surgeon see the patient every day and evaluates the patient's condition, prescribes fluid treatment, and assesses the presence and treatment of any complications. In addition, the patient is visiting the outpatient clinic approximately 30 days postoperatively. Any complications after discharge is recorded. Analysis The following analysis are planned: _ ""Intention_to_treat analysis"" analyses all included patients for the primary endpoint. _ ""Per_protocol analysis"" analyses those patients who have not been excluded following randomization (to be completed at > 10 exclusions only) _ Analyzes of the above subgroups. _ Analysis of the physiological data"
Nct	Direct Intra-arterial Thrombectomy in Order to Revascularize AIS Patients With Large Vessel Occlusion Efficiently in Chinese Tertiary Hospitals	2018		CN-01567282	"Protocol title: Direct Intra_arterial thrombectomy in order to Revascularize AIS patients with large vessel occlusion Efficiently in Chinese Tertiary hospitals: a Multicenter randomized clinical Trial (DIRECT_MT) Rationale: Intra_arterial treatment (IAT) by means of retrievable stents has been proven safe and effective in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with confirmed large vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation and in whom the procedure can be started within 6 hours from onset. Despite recanalization, a considerable proportion of patients do not recover. This can be attributed to potential adverse effects of the intravenous treatment (IVT) prior to IAT. These effects could include neurotoxicity, blood brain barrier leakage and thrombus fragmentation through softening of the thrombus. Another reason for non_recovery in MRCLEAN was the occurrence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) in 7% of patients, which was fatal in 65%. sICH occurred as often in the intervention as in the control group, suggesting that this complication could not be attributed to the IAT, but rather to pre_treatment with IVT. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that direct IAT may lead to a 8% absolute increase in good outcome compared to IAT preceded by IVT. Objective: To assess the effect of direct IAT compared to IVT followed by IAT, in patients with acute ischemic stroke, caused by a CTA_confirmed occlusion of the anterior circulation (ICA_T/L, M1, proximal M2) on functional outcome. Study design: This is a parallel group, randomized clinical trial of direct IAT versus IVT with IAT. The trial has observer blind assessment of the primary outcome and of neuro_imaging at baseline and follow up. Study population: Patients with acute ischemic stroke and a confirmed anterior circulation occlusion by CTA. Initiation of IVT must be feasible within 4.5 hours from symptom onset. Age must be 18 or over and NIHSS 2 or more. INCLUSION CRITERIA _ a clinical diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke, _ caused by a large vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation (distal intracranial carotid artery or middle M1/proximal M2) cerebral artery confirmed by CTA, _ CT or MRI ruling out intracranial hemorrhage, _ eligible for IVT and IAT (within 4.5 hours after symptom onset), _ a score of at least 2 on the NIH Stroke Scale, _ age of 18 years or older, _ written informed consent. EXCLUSION CRITERIA _ Pre_stroke disability which interferes with the assessment of functional outcome at 90 days, i.e. mRS >2 Intervention: The intervention group will undergo immediate IAT using a stent retriever, as recommended by the steering committee. The standard care group will receive IVT 0.9 mg/kg with a maximum dose of 90 mg in one hour, followed by IAT using a stent retriever. the investigators strive to reduce delays associated with IVT administration to a minimum to adequately assess the effect of IVT itself with IAT. Main study parameters/outcomes: The primary effect parameter will be the common odds ratio, estimated with ordinal logistic regression, which represents the shift on the full distribution of the modified Rankin Scale at 3 months. The estimate will be adjusted for the known prognostic variables age, pre_stroke mRS, time from onset to randomization, stroke severity (NIHSS) and collaterals and adjusted and unadjusted estimates with corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be reported. _ Any contra_indication for IVT, according to guidelines of the American Heart Association, i.e.: _ arterial blood pressure exceeding 185/110 mmHg _ blood glucose less than 2.7 or over 22.2 mmol/L _ cerebral infarction in the previous 6 weeks with residual neurological deficit or signs of recent infarction on neuro_imaging _ serious head trauma in the previous 3 months _ major surgery or serious trauma in the previous 2 weeks _ gastrointestinal or urinary tract hemorrhage in the previous 3 weeks _ previous intracerebral hemorrhage _ use of anticoagulant with INR exceeding 1.7 _ known thrombocyte ount less than 100 x 109/L _ treatment with direct thrombin or factor X inhibitors _ treatment with heparin (APTT exceeds the upper limit of normal value) in the previous 48 hours. Secondary outcomes include mortality at 90 days, stroke severity at 24 hours and 5_7 days, recanalization on CTA at 24 hours, dichotomous clinical outcome on the mRS and infarct size at 5_7 days. Safety outcomes include rate of sICH."
Nct	Magnesium Sulfate Dose in Obese Patients	2019		CN-01952943	"Magnesium sulfate has been applied in various situations due to actual or potential benefits related to neuroprotection, treatment of eclampsia/pre_eclampsia, arterial hypertension, adrenergic reflex under laryngoscopy/intubation and, shivering, nausea and vomiting, among others. In anesthesia it has been useful as an analgesic adjuvant; however, the method to calculate the dose of magnesium sulfate in obese population is unclear. The objective of this project is to compare two methods of dose calculation based either on the real weight or corrected ideal weight. Main objective: To determine the optimum strategy to safely and effectively obtain the value of magnesium concentration in the blood of obese population. Secondary objectives: To evaluate postoperative analgesia and the pharmacokinetic profile of neuromuscular blocker used in each group. Hypothesis: The null hypothesis is that no matter which method we use to calculate the magnesium sulfate dosage, the blood magnesium concentration will be the same. The alternative hypothesis is that magnesium sulfate dosage based on the patient's actual weight generates higher concentrations of magnesium than that required for postoperative analgesia, as compared with dosage based on that corrected ideal weight of the patient. Trial design: this is a prospective, controlled, randomized and double_blind clinical trial. Study setting This study will be conducted at Beneficence Portuguese Society, Santos, an academic hospital, in So Paulo, Brazil. A sample of 75 participants will be recruited from a population of obese patients scheduled to undergo cholecystectomy or bariatric surgery through laparoscopy. Interventions In the first phase of the trial, 10 patients with body mass index 20_30 kg/m_ will be administered magnesium sulphate 40 mg/kg at anesthetic induction. In all patients, blood collection will be conducted before administration of magnesium sulfate, and at 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 minutes after administration of magnesium sulfate. In the second phase of the trial, from among obese patients scheduled to undergo cholecystectomy or bariatric surgery through laparoscopy at our institute, 75 patients will be invited to participate in the trial. Participants will be assigned to three groups by electronic randomization process as follow: Placebo group (PG) without administration of magnesium sulfate; real weight group (RWG) administration of magnesium sulfate at 40 mg/kg of the patient's actual weight; corrected ideal weight group (CWG) administration of magnesium sulphate at 40 mg/kg of patient's corrected ideal weight. The corrected ideal weight will be calculated using the following formulas: Before extubation, the patients in both groups will be administered morphine 0,05 mg/kg and dipyrone 30 mg/kg. Five minutes after extubation and after each 30 minutes' interval, repeat dose of morphine will be administered at pain_score of > 3 (0 to 10) of the patient. Ideal weight Man = height (cm) _ 100 Woman = height (cm) _ 105 Corrected ideal weight = Ideal weight + (0,4 x difference between the real and ideal weight) The participants will not be administered any sedative agent before anesthetic induction. At arrival in the operating room, all patients will undergo electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure measurement, pulse oximetry, monitoring of neuromuscular function, and that of the level of consciousness. Venous access and hydration will be achieved according to the anesthesiologist's judgment. At the time of puncture of the vein, the first 2_ml blood sample will be collected to establish the basal concentration of magnesium in the blood. Within 10 min after collection of the blood, dosage will be calculated according to the following chart (Figure 1). In all participants, infusion of treatment solution will be performed by a blinded investigator, and ketoprofen 100 mg, clonidine 2 µg/kg, cefazolin 2 g, dexamethasone 4 mg, ranitidine 50 mg and lidocaine 1,5 mg/kg will be administered simultaneously. At the end of infusion participants will unde go pre_oxygenation with 100% O2 for 3 to 5 min, followed by propofol through target controlled infusion with initial target of 4 µg/ml according to Marsh's pharmacokinetic model, under monitoring for the level of hypnoses. At the time of adequate level of hypnoses, revealed by the hypnoses monitor (SedLine¨ Brain Function Monitoring) calibration of the monitor of neuromuscular function (train_of_four _ TOF) will be performed; subsequently, cisatracurium 0.15 mg/kg will be administered, and target_controlled infusion of remifentanil (Minto's pharmacokinetic model) at initial target concentration of 5 ng/ml will be conducted. Under hypnoses monitoring, 0.03 mg/kg cisatracurium will be administered if TOF ³ 2 is observed or on surgical demand. Remifentanil infusion will be conducted according to the patient's hemodynamics, such that systolic pressure is maintained within 30% limits from the baseline value, or maximum value of 130 mmHg and minimum value of 90 mmHg are achieved. During the last 20 minutes' period of surgery, cisatracurium will be withheld, when possible. At the end of surgery, at TOF > 2, atropine 20 µg/kg and neostigmine 40 µg/kg will be administered."
Nct	Comparison of the Ambu AuraGain and Intersurgical i-Gel Laryngeal Masks in Elective Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy	2019		CN-02053366	"Design: Prospective, controlled, randomized study. Participants:After approval by the local Clinical Research Ethics Committee, all patients scheduled for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy at Plat Hospital (Barcelona) will be screened for participation. Patients will be informed about the study and they must provide written consent. The need for orotracheal intubation during surgery will be consider as a study withdrawal criterion. The primary outcome is the oropharyngeal leak pressure (OLP). The secondary outcomes are: insertion time, number of attempts, ventilatory airway peak pressure, time and success rates for gastric tube insertion and side effects. Sample size has been calculated to detect a significant difference in oropharyngeal leak pressure (OLP) between two devices. According to the results of previous studies we assume a mean OLP of 29.2 (3.3) cmH2O for the i_Gel and of 34 (5) cmH2O for the Ambu AuraGain. In order to detect a difference of 10%, assuming a standard deviation of 5 cmH2O for both devices, 44 patients are required per group with a power of 80% and an alpha error of 0.05. To cover against a dropout rate of 10%, a total of 98 patients will be recruited. The patients included in the study will be numbered consecutively and assigned to one of the two groups, 'LMA Ambu AuraGain' or 'i_gel', using a computer_generated random number table, by the principal investigator. The individual result will be kept in opaque envelopes. After the recruitment, the day of the procedure, the enrolling investigator will open sealed, opaque envelopes that conceals the group allocation. Participants will be blinded to their group allocation. A gastric tube will be inserted via the drain tube. The correct placement of the gastric tube will be confirmed by free movement during insertion and by aspiration of gastric fluid or detection of injected air by epigastric auscultation. Oropharyngeal Leak Pressure (OLP) will be measured by closing the expiratory valve of the circle system at a fixed gas flow of 3 litres/min (maximum allowed 40 cmH2O) recording the pressure at which equilibrium has been reached or audible air is leaking. The leak pressure will be recorded before peritoneal insufflation and during pneumoperitoneum. The peritoneal insufflation pressure will be set at 12 mmHg. At the end of surgery, the anaesthesiologist will remove the laryngeal masks when the patients obey commands. The patients will be transferred to the Post_Anaesthesia Care Unit (PACU) to be monitored after the surgery. Procedures In the operating room intravenous access will be secured and routine monitoring using ECG, non invasive blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, end_tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) and sevoflurane (EtSevo) (Datex_Ohmeda S/5 Compact Critical Care Monitor; GE Healthcare). After pre_oxygenation with 100% oxygen by facemask for 3 min, anaesthesia will be induced with intravenous Fentanyl 50 _g/ml (2_g/kg), Propofol 1% (2_3 mg/kg) and Rocuronio 1% (0,6 mg/kg). We will continue ventilating with 100% oxygen using a facemask at least for 1 min until optimum conditions for laryngeal mask insertion are achieved (loss of eyelash reflex, relaxation of the jaw, immobility and apnoea). Anaesthesia will be maintained with Sevoflurane 2% in an air_oxygen mixture using a circle system with fresh gas flow of 2 l/min. Additional intravenous Fentanyl will be administrated as clinically needed during anaesthesia by an increase of 10_20% in blood pressure or heart rate. Laryngeal masks size will be determined according to the manufacturers weight_based recommendations and the insertion technique will be according to the recommendations of the Instruction Manual. After successful insertion, the cuff will be inflated with air until 60 cmH2O intracuff pressure (ICP) measured using an Ambu¨ airway pressure manometer (AMBU, S.L. B_ 81040149, Alcala, Madrid, Spain). A second measurement of intracuff pressure will be performed for surgeries taking over an hour to ensure that the intracuff pressure has not c anged significantly (± 5 cmH2O) since the last calibrated intracuff pressure. An effective airway will be judged by a square wave capnograph trace, bilateral chest auscultation and no audible leak with peak airway pressures at 12 cmH2O or greater during gentle manual ventilation. The device will be connected to the respiratory machine (Datex_Ohmeda S/5 Compact Critical Care Monitor; GE Healthcare) and patients will be ventilated with a tidal volume of 8 ml/kg, adjusting the respiratory rate to an end tidal CO2 of 30_35mmHg. Statistical Analysis Data will be entered into an Excel Database. All statistical analyses will be conducted using software from the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, Version 18.0, Chicago, IL, USA). The distribution of data will be determined using Kolmogorov_ Smirnov analysis. The quantitative variables will be summarized with means and standard deviations, or with medians and percentiles P25 and P75 in case of asymmetric distributions, and qualitative variables with frequencies and percentages. To study the relationships between qualitative variables, contingency tables will be made and the Chi square or Fisher's tests will be used. The difference in oropharyngeal leak pressure (OLP) between two devices will be analysed by a Student _s t_test or the Mann_Whitney U test in case of non_normal distributions. To compare the incidence of side effects between the groups, the exact Fisher test or Chi squared tests will be used. Significant differences will be quantified with 95% confidence intervals."
Nct	Metformin in Alzheimer's Dementia Prevention	2019		CN-01992077	"STUDY PROCEDURES AT THE LEVEL OF THE PARTICIPANT. 1. Screening. We propose a 2_tier approach for screening, including telephone pre_screening followed by in_person screening. Telephone screening includes questions about inclusion and exclusion criteria including demographics (age, language), medical history, contraindications to metformin, and medications. At the time of telephone contact for screening, we will conduct the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) if the potential participant agrees, as was conducted in the MetMCI study. A Score > 34 on the TICS out of 41 is considered normal cognition. Persons with this score will not be invited to participate. Only persons that meet inclusion criteria and do not meet exclusion criteria are invited for in_person screening. In_person screening includes consent, in_person anthropometric measurements (height, weight, waist and hip circumference), vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate), EKG, laboratory tests (TSH, RPR, vitamin B12, complete blood count [CBC], basic metabolic panel [BMP], Hepatic panel, Lipid panel, and Hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c]), and the in person_neuropsychological battery that is used to determine aMCI. At the time of screening the tester may choose to complete other assessments that would be scheduled for the first visit; otherwise, these assessments will be done in the baseline visit. 2. Baseline/screening study visit. The baseline study visit will include the following assessments. History includes age, handedness, education, occupation and employment history, past medical history, and all medications utilized, including a judgment as to whether they affect cognition (positively or negatively). Referral source is also documented. Psychiatric history, current and past history of depression, current anxiety, alcohol and other substance use, head injury, hypertension, cardiac disease, thyroid disease, other major medical conditions, and surgery are evaluated at screening. A full medical history will be obtained only at screening. Any report of events, or side effects will prompt a full history and physical exam at any visit. Physical exam will be conducted at screening, with particular emphasis on signs of congestive heart failure, pulmonary, liver, or renal disease for contraindications to metformin, and neurologic examination for the presence of neurologic diseases. Vital signs including blood pressure and heart rate will also be ascertained. Standing height will be measured using a stadiometer calibrated in cm. Body weight is measured using a balance beam scale calibrated in kg. With the participant standing, measurements are taken to the nearest 0.1 kg of weight with a balance scale and height without shoes to nearest 0.5 cm, to calculate BMI (weight in k/height in m2). Waist circumference (WC) is measured at the level of the umbilicus. Hip circumference (HP) is measured at the level of maximal protrusion of the gluteal muscles. Resting Blood Pressure (BP) will be measured using an automated oscillometric device, 3 measurements will be obtained at 1_minute intervals in a seated position after 5 minutes of rest. The average of the 2nd and 3rd measurements will be recorded. Neuropsychological battery. For neuropsychological testing verbatim instructions for administration and specific scoring guidelines will be available. All tests are validated in English and Spanish. We will use different versions of the tests when available (e.g. different word lists) to account for learning effects. The following is an expanded description of the neuropsychological battery: Total Recall Score of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT). The FCSRT is a 16 item word list with visual and auditory presentation that uses semantic cuing to facilitate encoding and retrieval. The test has a score range of 0 to 48. Paragraph Recall on the Logical Memory IIa (episodic memory): Free recall of 1 short story that consists of 25 bits of information will be elicited immediately after it is read aloud to the subject and again after approxima ely 30_minute delay. The total bits of information from the story that are recalled immediately (maximum score = 25) and after the delay interval (maximum score = 25) are recorded. The delay score (0_25 story units) will be used in the composite. Digit_Symbol Substitution Test: The Digit Symbol Substitution test is a subset from the WAIS_R. The test consists of 110 small blank squares presented in 7 rows with 1 of 9 numbers (1_9) randomly printed directly above each blank square. A ""key"" is printed above the rows of blank squares. The ""key"" pairs numbers 1 through 9 with an unfamiliar symbol. The subject must work as fast as possible for 90 seconds. The measure of interest is number of squares filled in correctly within the time limit (maximum raw score = 110). Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE). The MMSE scale evaluates orientation, memory, attention, concentration, naming, repetition, comprehension, and ability to create a sentence and to copy 2 overlapping pentagons. The MMSE is scored as the number of correctly completed items with a lower score indicative of poorer performance and greater cognitive impairment. The total score ranges from 0 (worse) to 30 (perfect). Trail_Making Test, Part A: This test of visuoperceptual ability, attention and speed consists of 25 circles distributed over a white sheet of 8 1/2"" X 11"" paper that are numbered. The participant is instructed to connect the circles with a pencil line as quickly as possible all numbers in an ascending order (e.g., 1 to 2; 2 to 3; etc). The participant's performance is judged in terms of the time (in seconds) required to complete the task and by the number of errors of commission and omission. The time to complete the trial will be the measures of interest. Trail_Making Test, Part B: This test of visuoperceptual ability, attention and set_shifting ability consists of 25 circles distributed over a white sheet of 8 1/2"" X 11"" paper that are either numbered (1 through 13) or contain letters (A through L). The participant is instructed to connect the circles with a pencil line as quickly as possible while alternating between numbers and letters in an ascending order (e.g., A to 1; 1 to B; B to 2; 2 to C). The participant's performance is judged in terms of the time (in seconds) required to complete the task and by the number of errors of commission and omission. The time to complete the trial will be the measures of interest. Trail_Making Test, Part B is available in multiple forms of equal difficulty for purposes of repeated evaluations. ADAScog12. This test will be used as part of the core battery and assesses memory, reasoning, naming, orientation, ideational praxis, constructional praxis, spoken language, language comprehension, word finding difficulty, and ability to remember test instructions. The addition of a 10 word delay recall adds sensitivity in aMCI and yields maximum score of 80. Functional abilities: ADCS_ADL_PI:The ADCS_ADL_PI was developed in the ADCS Prevention Instruments Trial. The subject rates his/her performance of 18 IADL tasks over the past 2 months. Questions about use of technology (e.g., computers and cell phones) are included. Responses for each IADL include improved IADL performance (fewer errors, faster completion, less need to refer to notes or instructions), no change ('as well as usual'), various levels of impaired performance, and non_performance. Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). The CDR is a clinical scale that rates the severity of dementia as absent, questionable, mild, moderate, or severe (CDR score of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, or 3, respectively). The score is based on interviews with the subject and study partner, using a structured interview that assesses 6 domains: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. The ratings of degree of impairment obtained on each of the 6 categories of function are synthesized into 1 global rating of dementia (ranging from 0 to 3), with more refined measure of change available by use of the Sum of Boxes (CDR_SB). eliability and validity has been established, as has high inter_rater reliability. Memory Complaint Questionnaire (MAC_Q): The MAC_Q consists of six items. The first five items relate to specific situations that are frequently reported as troublesome for those with declining memory, and the last item broadly measures overall self_perceived memory decline. Cognitive diagnoses. The research physician will complete the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Centers (NACC) Assessment and Uniform Data Set (UDS), which takes 35 minutes and includes detailed medical and family history, and neurological exam, including the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale for extrapyramidal signs, psychiatric assessment with the short version of the Geriatric Depression Scale and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) questions, assessment of vascular risk factors plus the Hachinski scale, and a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Cognitive diagnosis will be examined for inclusion and exclusion purposes and will also be examined as an exploratory outcome. For cognitive diagnosis transitions (i.e. conversion from MCI to dementia), an adjudication panel at the CCMC will conduct monthly consensus meetings or calls. This panel will be comprised of co_investigators Luchsinger, Goldberg, Devanand, Manly, and Brickman. During the meeting information of all the cognitive, functional and other clinical information of the subjects will be presented, blind to study allocation. Evidence of cognitive deficits (based on the neuropsychological scores), evidence of impairment in social or occupational function (as assessed by the functional measures), and evidence of cognitive and social_occupational function decline will be the criteria used for the diagnosis of dementia. 3. Randomization. Eligible participants will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive either metformin or placebo, using randomly permuted block randomization of size two or four by each site to achieve balance of treatment assignment overall and by site. The distribution of kits of active metformin or placebo were previously described. 4. Titration and repeated neuropsychological testing. After participants consent, are deemed eligible, and complete the baseline assessment, they will complete a 30_day titration period in which the metformin dose will be increased from 500 mg a day at randomization in increments of 500 mg every 10 days to a maximum of 2,000 mg a day. The metformin tablets are taken together as a single dose, usually recommended once at night. Participants unable to tolerate at least 1,000 mg a day will be excluded from the study. Participants will have in person visits every 10 days to check on their metformin tolerance and to conduct repeated neuropsychological testing. During this titration period, participants will have repeated cognitive tests at day 10, 20, and 30 after randomization. 5. Baseline Brain MRI. Participants who remain in the study after titration be invited to have a baseline brain MRI without contrast. We expect that approximately half of participants will be willing to do MRI and will not have contraindications, based on our current experience at Columbia. Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with 3T magnets will be conducted in 186 participants across all sites. MRI sequences will include 3Plane Gradient Echo Localizer, 3D MPRAGE T1 (Morphological), 3D T2 (Morphological), DTI 30 direction (anisotropy, mean diffusivity), DTI 30 direction (anisotropy, mean diffusivity), pCASL Axial(Arterial Spin Labeling/CBF), pCASL Axial Calibration. Acquisition of these sequences will take approximately 50 minutes. 6. Monthly and ad_lib follow_up calls, text messages, or mails. We will conduct monthly follow_up calls to inquire about adverse events and issues with metformin tolerance. We will prefer voice calls, but will provide the options to participants of receiving and replying to text messages or emails. We will encourage participants to communicate with the site staff ad_lib in case of contingencies, comments, or questions. We will use the ADCS Adverse Event Checklist to monitor adverse events. In this case we will emphasize potential adverse effects of metformin such as gastrointestinal side effects (e.g. diarrhea), and development of contraindications (class III or IV congestive heart failure, renal insufficiency, hepatic insufficiency). We will also inquire about potential situations in which metformin needs to be held temporarily such as surgery and the administration of intravenous contrast. 7. Follow_up visits: We will repeat all clinical (non_brain imaging) assessments at months 6, 12, 18, and 24. The only exception is that we will test TSH and RPR only at baseline. All other laboratory tests will be repeated. Pill counts will be conducted to assess compliance with metformin and placebo. In addition, we will administer the adverse events checklist. All remaining study drug or placebo will be retrieved to assess compliance and for disposal. 8. Follow_up Brain MRI. Participants who undergo a baseline MRI will be invited to have a follow_up brain MRI with the same sequences after the completion of the last visit at month 24. The MRI will be completed within one month of the last visit."
Nct	Opioid Free Versus Opioid Balanced Anesthesia	2019		CN-01918894	"After approval of the Ethical Committee of Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University and having an informed written consent from every patient included in the study, the present study will be carried out in Alexandria Main University Hospitals on sixty adult patients belonging to ASA class I or II scheduled for middle ear surgery under general anaesthesia. (The sample size is approved to be sufficient by the Department of Statistics, Medical Research Institute, University of Alexandria). Inclusion criteria: _ Patients of either sex. _ American Society Anesthesiologists' physical status I_II. _ Age between 18 and 50 years. Exclusion criteria:(depend on table 1) _ Patients with gastrointestinal disease. _ A history of motion sickness, or a previous episode of PONV. _ Patient received any opioid, steroid, or antiemetic medication within 72 h before surgery. _ Those who were pregnant or menstruating. _ History of opioid or drug abuse. METHODS Patients will be randomly allocated into two equal groups (thirty patients each) using the closed envelope method. I will compare postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in patients scheduled for middle ear surgery. Sixty patients will be randomly allocated to receive either balanced anaesthesia (group A) using fentanyl, propofol and isoflurane, or opioid free anaesthesia (group B) using propofol and isoflurane. Pain scores, nausea Ú vomiting scores, conditions for surgery and analgesic requirements will be recorded post operatively. Anaesthetic management Preoperative management All patients will be visited before surgery to be clinically assessed and the preoperative surveillance includes: _ Haematological screening (Complete blood picture, Serum electrolytes). _ Standard coagulation studies e.g. prothrombin time, international normalized ratio (PT_INR). On arrival to the operating room and before anaesthetic induction all patients will be monitored by the standard routine monitoring, which include: _ A 5_lead electrocardiography. _ A non_invasive blood pressure (NIBP) (mmHg). _ Pulse oximetry (%). _ Capnography. (End Tidal CO2 pattern and value in mmHg). _ Temperature monitoring. A peripheral intravenous cannula of 20 gauges will be inserted in a dorsal vein of the non_dominant hand. Premedication with Midazolam in a dose of 0.02mg/ Kg will be used. Induction Preoxygenation with 100 % O2 for 3 minutes. General anaesthesia will be induced by propofol (2 mg/kg) and atracurium (0.5 mg/kg) intravenously guided by a nerve stimulator, followed by endotracheal intubation after loss of train of four. All the patients will receive i.v. acetaminophen (1000 mg) _20 min after induction and i.v. ketorolac (30 mg). Local analgesia will be injected by surgeon. All patients will receive beta blocker (Inderal 1mg) and magnesium sulphate (15_30mg/kg) for achieving hypotensive anaesthesia. Maintenance Maintenance of general anaesthesia with a mixture of isoflurane (1MAC) and oxygen. All patients will be mechanically ventilated with an anaesthesia machine to keep SpO2 > 95% and end_tidal CO2 between 35_45 mmHg. Additional atracurium will be administrated as appropriate in bolus doses if needed. Group A Fentanyl (1mg/kg i.v.) will be administered before general anaesthesia (GA). GA will be maintained with inhalation anaesthetics (isoflurane) at a minimum alveolar concentration of 0.7_1.3. Group B Opioid free anesthesia (syringe of saline is given instead of fentanyl) and the same general anesthesia is given as group A(muscle relaxant ,propofol, inhalation for maintance). Measurements 1. Demographic data: Age (years), sex, weight (kilograms). 2. Hemodynamic parameters: _ Pulse oximetry (%) _ Heart rate (HR). Beats/minute _ Mean Non_Invasive arterial blood pressure (NIBP) (mmHg) Recovery At the end of surgery, isoflurane will be discontinued, 100% oxygen will be given, all patients will be planned for extubation in the operating room depending on recovery criteria after complete reversal of muscle relaxant with neostigmine (up to 5 mg). Tra heal extubation will be performed in a semi_ sitting position after fulfilling the criteria for extubation. Extubation criteria include: a fully conscious patient, haemodynamic stability, reversal of neuromuscular blockade, TOF ratio 0.9 _ 1 on nerve stimulator, and the ability of head lift for 5 seconds. Postoperative multimodal pain management Postoperative pain will be treated with i.v. acetaminophen (1000mg) and i.v. ketorolac (30 mg) every 6 h for the first 24 h. Postoperative pain will be measured on an 11_point numeric pointscale (NPS). management of PONV Dexamethasone (8 mg i.v.) will be administered during induction, ondansetron (4 mg i.v.) and metoclopramide (10 mg i.v.) post operative if Patients complaining of PONV after discharge from the PACU. 3. Pain assessment The level of pain will be assessed on an 11_point NPS. Patients will be asked to determine their own 'acceptable' pain score. The 11_point numeric scale ranges from '0' representing no pain extreme to '10' representing the other pain extreme (worst pain imaginable).(8) 4. Nausea and vomiting assessment (table2,3) Patients will be asked to rate the worst episode of PONV on a four_point verbal rating scale (VRS) (none, mild, moderate, or severe). Patients were also will be asked whether they experienced retching or vomiting. 5. Sedation assessment Sedation score: 0. Alert 1. Mild, drowsy, easy to awake 2. Moderate, easy to arouse 3. Severe: somnolent difficult to arouse 4. Sleeping The Sedation score will be documented at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours. 6. Satsifacation of patient assessment by QoR40 questionnaire The QoR_40 is a global measure of quality of recovery. It incorporates five dimensions: patient support, comfort, emotions, physical independence, and pain; each item is graded on a five_point Likert scale. QoR_40 scores range from 40 (extremely poor quality of recovery) to 200 (excellent quality of recovery).(29) Timing Hemodynamic (blood pressure, pulse) of Patients will be assessed during the surgery every 10 minutes and at 1 and 2 h after the end of surgery and at discharge from the day unit. At each of these times, the nurse recorded the incidence and worst severity of pain, nausea and emesis since the last evaluation using the same criteria as before. Any medication will be given for pain or nausea (administered for moderate_severe symptoms, or at patient request) will be also recorded, till the time of discharge. Patients will be discharged with medication comprising slow_release ibuprofen. The following day, the researcher will telephone the patient to assess the incidence and worst severity of pain, nausea and emesis since discharge and whether any analgesia or antiemetics will be taken. Patients will be also asked to record their satisfaction with the control of pain, the control of sickness and their overall day surgery experience on 11_point (0_10) verbal rating scales."
Nct	Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block to Treat Shoulder Pain After Laparoscopic Surgery	2019		CN-01992146	"Purpose of the Study The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the efficacy of sphenopalatine ganglion block (SPGB) block to manage shoulder tip pain (STP) after laparoscopic surgery. Background The laparoscopic technique has increasingly become a popular approach for many gynecologic, urologic, thoracic, bariatric and general surgical procedures. While laparoscopic surgery results in less postoperative pain than traditional open surgical techniques, it is associated with three distinct types of postoperative pain: incisional, visceral, and shoulder. The pain experienced in the shoulder is referred from irritation of the diaphragm and is referred to as shoulder tip pain (STP) to differentiate it from pain that originates in the shoulder. STP may persist for longer than incisional and visceral pain and may be the most difficult to treat. Narcotic and non_narcotic analgesics have only limited success in relieving STP, but none of these reliably eliminates STP, and they may be associated with undesirable systemic side effects. Recently the SPGB has been described as a means of managing STP (Grant 2018). The SPGB was originally described more than 100 years ago as a treatment for headache (Sluder 1908). Since it was first described, the SPGB has been touted to relieve many types of pain, primarily of the head, but also pain extending down to the lower back (Berger 1986). The SPG is located in pterygopalatine fossa adjacent to the sphenopalatine foramen. It is posterior to the middle nasal turbinate and separated from the nasal cavity by as little as 2 mm of mucosa. The proximity of the SPG to the nasal cavity facilitates renders it accessible to local anesthetic block. When local anesthetic is applied to the posterior nasopharyngeal mucosa, drug diffuses into the SPG and inhibits nerve conduction. The local anesthetic can be administered by injection, via a cotton_tipped applicator, or by simply dripping it into the nose when the patient is positioned with neck extension (Barre 1982). Study Design This will be a randomized controlled trial to treat STP with local anesthetic or placebo in after laparoscopic surgery. The primary outcome variable will be reduction of STP. Number of Subjects A power analysis was conducted to determine the minimum number of patents required to provide an indication that the SPG block will ameliorate STP after laparoscopic surgery. Assuming that a decrease in 2 NRS units will be clinically significant, and setting alpha as 0.05 and beta as 0.8, 36 patients per group will be needed, i.e., 76 total. The investigators will recruit 10% more patients to account for dropouts. The investigators are therefore requesting approval to enroll 90 patients in the study. (Tsai HW, Wang PH, Yen MS, Chao KC, Hsu TF, Chen YJ. Prevention of postlaparoscopic shoulder and upper abdominal pain: a randomized controlled trial. Obstet Gynecol. 2013 Mar;121(3):526_31). Gender of Subjects This study is open to women and men. Age of Subjects The study will be open to individuals aged 18 years old or greater. Racial and Ethnic Origin There will be no effort to create a particular racial or ethnic distribution of patients for this study. Inclusion Criteria _ Any type of gynecologic, urological, thoracic, bariatric and general surgical procedures _ Presence of post_operative STP, VAS > 4/10 _ American Society of Anesthesiologists Class 1 _ 3 Exclusion Criteria _ American Society of Anesthesiologists Class 4 or 5. _ Allergy to lidocaine. _ Any patient who the PI feels will be unable to comply with all protocol related procedures _ Shoulder pain prior to surgery PROCEDURE: Active drug and control: Data Analysis and Data Safety Monitoring Plan Methods & Procedures At any time during hospitalization after surgery (that is, once the patient is sufficiently awake to rate their pain in the ward until hospital discharge), if moderate_to_severe STP pain is present, the study team will be notified. The patient will be asked to rate their pain using an 11_point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) to conf rm that the VAS is > 4/10. Informed consent will then be obtained, and SPGB will be performed. Active drug group is 10% lidocaine diluted to 5% lidocaine (LIDO group). Control group is saline (SALINE group). The syringes will be filled (by the pharmacy?) with 1.5 mL of either solution and labeled in a blinded manner. The SPGB will be performed by placing the patient supine with the neck extended, a position achieved by placing a padded support under their shoulders with the chip up. If the STP is unilateral, the head will be rotated to the side of the pain, and if the STP is bilateral, the head will be maintained in the midline position. Next, 1.5 mL of 5% lidocaine solution or saline will be dripped into one (for unilateral STP) or both nostrils (for bilateral STP), and the position will be maintained for 30 minutes. If the STP is not relieved, the procedure will be repeated using 1.5 mL of the active drug (5% lidocaine). Patients will be followed after the SPG block(s), and the duration of pain relief will be monitored by serial assessments of the NRS. In addition, all patients will have PRN access to standard systemic analgesics as routinely ordered by their surgical service. Safety assessments will be performed on all subjects. Blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate will be obtained every 15 minutes after each SPG block for 90 minutes. The expected outcome of this study is a decrease in shoulder pain. A decrease in shoulder pain NRS of 2 points or greater will be taken as an indication that the block has worked. Data collection Additional data will be collected from an each of the study participant's electronic medical file. Data collection will include; demographic data, obstetric data, anesthetic data, anesthetic and surgical complications, analgesic requirements, hospital length of and admissions to ICU. All gathered information will be coded in anonymous coding in order to preserve patient privacy rights. Risk The dripping of 5% lidocaine or saline into the nose is associated with minimal risk, but some discomfort. The most common sources of discomfort are a sense of burning in the nasal mucosa when 5% lidocaine or saline is dripped into the nose. 5% lidocaine may produce a bitter taste in the mouth and numbness in the back of the throat as it drips down from the nasopharynx down into the oropharynx. Saline may produce a salty taste in the mouth as it drips down from the nasopharynx down into the oropharynx. With any procedure that involves local anesthetic there is a risk of drug allergy, although this is a rare event. Protection Against Risks To prevent and/or minimize potential risks or discomfort, the anesthesiologist who performs the SPGB will closely monitor the patient for the duration of administration of the block and for a minimum of 20 minutes following the block. Any annoying throat numbness or bitter taste would not be expected to last no more than 20 minutes or so after the last SPGB is performed. We are not aware of any risk to the patient from the intranasal administration of a maximum of 150 mg of lidocaine via the nose over 30 minutes. However, safety assessments will be performed on all subjects. Blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate will be obtained every 15 minutes after each SPG block for 90 minutes."
Nct	Assessment of Remifentanil for Rapid Sequence Induction and Intubation in Full Stomach Patient Compared to Muscle Relaxant	2019		CN-01945010	"BACKGROUND: Rapid sequence intubation is the reference anaesthetic procedure for patient at risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents (for example emergency procedure, bowel obstruction, obese patients, gastroesophageal reflux É) or difficult airway management. Nowadays the use of Succinylcholine (CELOCURINE), a neuromuscular blockade with a short duration of action, is recommended in this indication. However, several adverse events are frequently reported, especially anaphylactic reaction, restraining its use for rapid sequence intubation. Other adverse effects such as extended neuromuscular block, malignant hyperthermia or severe hyperkaliemia prohibit its use. In this case the use of another neuromuscular blockade, Rocuronium (ESMERON), is an alternative solution. Unfortunately, this other molecule causes as many anaphylactic event as Succinylcholine (1 anaphylactic event for 3000 uses) and produce a long duration of neuromuscular block. Incidence of anaphylactic reaction is increasing in France and mostly severe reactions. Its utilization is therefore reduced to 31 to 55% of crush induction despite the recommendations. Remifentanil is an opioid agent with very shorts delay and duration of action. Several study have shown similar intubation conditions in planned surgery with the use of Remifentanil instead of neuromuscular blockade and less hemodynamic reactions. Remifentanil is already approved for anesthetic induction and recognized as an alternative to neuromuscular blockade for the intubation of children. Use of remifentanil has shown satisfying intubation conditions for adults but its incidence of major complications compared to succinylcholine remains unknown. Study hypothesis: The investigators thus hypothesized that Remifentanil is non inferior to neuromuscular blockade in terms of major complications after a crush induction. Methods: A multicenter simple blind randomized controlled trial. 11 centers will participate in this project. Experimental treatment arm: During anesthetic induction remifentanil will be injected immediately after hypnotic drug through bolus intravenous injection by a peripheral or verified central venous access, at 3 to 4 µg/kg. Orotracheal intubation will be performed 30 to 60 seconds later by a graduated anesthesiologist or a resident with 4 validated semesters. Control arm treatment: A neuromuscular blockade will be injected right after the hypnotic drug. Whether succinylcholine (CELOCURINE) at 1mg/kg or Rocuronium (ESMERON) at 1mg/kg in a bolus intravenous injection by a peripheral or verified central venous access. Orotracheal intubation will be performed after occurring of fasciculations with succinylcholine or 30 to 60 seconds after injection of Rocuronium by a graduated anesthesiologist or a resident with 4 validated semesters. Objective and judgment criteria: The primary objective is to demonstrate non inferiority of Remifentanil compared to neuromuscular blockade in terms of major complications after a crush induction. Primary endpoint is the rate of tracheal intubation without major complications as defined by 1/ tracheal intubation with less than 2 laryngoscopies 2/ no aspiration during the 10 minutes after induction 3/ no desaturation under 95% during the 10 minutes after induction 4/ no hypo or hypertension as defined by a Median blood pressure<50 mmHg or >110 mmHg 5/ NO ventricular arrhythmia involving an emergency treatment or cardiac arrest during the 10 minutes after induction 6/ No grade III or IV anaphylactic reaction after the 10 minutes after induction. Statistical analyses: A 80% incidence of intubation without major complication was hypothesized. Non inferiority has been set under a superior limit of 7% for the primary endpoint 95% of the proportions difference between intervention and control group. In order to achieve 80 power with a 5% alpha risk, 1150 patients (575 for each arms) are to be included."
Nct	Effects of Chewing Gum on Glycaemic Control in Women With Gestational Diabetes	2019		CN-01945034	"Study design and participants This study is designed as an open_label, mono_centre randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups including a total of 74 female patients with recent diagnosis of GDM. Diagnosis of GDM is made in accordance with the IADPSG criteria between 24+0 and 27+6 weeks of gestation [IADPSG 2010]. All pregnant females (aged between 18 and 45 years) will be recruited consecutively among women visiting our pregnancy outpatient department (Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Obstetrics and fetomaternal Medicine, Medical University of Vienna). Exclusion criteria _ Preconceptional overt diabetes (such as type 1 or type 2 diabetes) _ History of bariatric surgery or surgeries that induce malabsorption _ HIV_ or hepatitis infection _ Decreased liver or kidney function (before pregnancy) _ history of malignant disorders _ Abuse of toxic substances _ Use of systemic steroids _ Multiple pregnancy Treatment and Interventions Eligible patients are randomized to receive either routine care (control group) or routine care in addition to a chewing gum intervention for five days (beginning with the second study day, i.e. the day after baseline examination): sugar_free, fruit or mint flavoured gum chewed three times daily for 20 minutes before each meal. Routine care includes standard dietary and lifestyle advice for 30 minutes following our local recommendations as well as an advice on capillary blood glucose measurement (fasting as well as 1h after starting each meal). Capillary blood glucose profiles are re_ evaluated seven days after starting the blood glucose monitoring. Study visits will be scheduled at screening (visit 1, where eligible patients were randomized) as well as seven days later (visit 2). Randomisation Participants will be randomized to either treatment (chewing gum) or control group (routine care) in a 1:1 ratio. The minimisation method [Pocock 1975] will be used to minimize the imbalance between the groups according to the preconceptional overweight/obesity status with three strata: i. normal weight (i.e. BMI below 25 kg/m2); ii. overweight (BMI 26 _ 30 kg/m2); iii. obesity (BMI and above 30 kg/m2). Medical history and baseline examination A broad risk evaluation will be performed in participating females at the initial contact (between 24+0 and 32+0 weeks of gestation) including: evaluation of maternal age, parity, history of GDM, detailed family history, ethnicity, preconceptional diseases, use of ovulation drugs, obstetric history. Moreover, an evaluation of preconceptional weight and BMI as well as measurement of blood pressure will be performed. Assessment of dietary patterns Dietary patterns will be assessed at baseline (visit 1) by using a published and validated Food_Frequency_Questionnaire (FFQ) proposed by the German Robert Koch Institute [Haftenberg 2010]. It was also previously used for the German DEGS project (www.degs_studie.de). Information from the FFQ will be analyzed quantitatively or summarized by eating scores proposed in the literature (such as the Healthy Eating Index 2010 or Alternate Healthy Eating Index 2010) reflecting diet quality based on actual guidelines [Guenther 2013, Chiuve 2012]. In addition all patients will be advised to conduct a nutritional protocol for seven days. D. End Points Secondary end points are fasting glucose concentrations and longitudinal changes (i.e. assessment of group by time interactions in fasting and postprandial glucose trajectories) as well as changes in dietary patterns. E. Statistical Analysis Statistical comparison of continuous parameters (e.g. postprandial or fasting glucose concentrations) will be performed by the two_sample t_test or nonparametric The three primary end points of this study are the averages (arithmetic mean values) of five days 1h postprandial capillary blood glucose measurements: after breakfast (primary end point 1), lunch (primary end point 2) and dinner (primary end point 3). Sample size With a sample size of n=35 subjects per group we are able t detect a mean difference of 8 mg/dl in postprandial glucose levels with a power of 81% and a type 1 error of _=0.016 for a two_sided unpaired student's t_test, providing a standard deviation of 10 mg/dl in accordance with [Landon 2009]. In order to achieve a 95% coverage probability, the Bonferroni correction will be used to adjust for multiple testing (three primary outcomes). Considering a drop_out rate of 5% n=74 cases are required for this study. A sample size review and adaptation is planned after 50% of the subjects have been investigated. Analysis Plan Categorical variables will be summarized by counts and percentages; continuous variables data are summarized by means and standard deviations (SD) or by median and interquartile range in the case of strong deviations from the normal distribution. approaches (e.g. the Brunner_Munzel test), respectively. An adjustment for demographic variables (such as age) will be performed in case of significant group differences using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) or by the proportional odds model, if the normality assumption is violated. Linear mixed effects models will be used to assess longitudinal changes of parameters of interest (i.e. fasting and postprandial glucose). Interaction terms are included in the longitudinal models to assess group differences and variable transformations (e.g. logarithmic or square root transformation) are used if necessary. A two_sided p_value ²0.05 is considered statistically significant. Using the Bonferroni correction for multiple statistical testing (three hypotheses) this results in a 98.33% confidence interval to achieve a 95% simultaneous coverage probability. All analyses will be performed by using the statistic software R and contributing packages [R Core Team 2016]."
Nct	Efficacy and Safety of Liraglutide on Body Weight in Obese Subjects or Overweight Subjects With Co-morbidities	2020		CN-02137443	"We performed a multicenter, randomized, double_blind, placebo_controlled 28_week trial. 300 individuals (18_75 years of age, body_mass index ³30 kg/m2 or BMI 27_30kg/m2 accompanied by at least one weight_related complication (treated or untreated hypertension, dyslipidemia, pre_diabetes)) were randomly assigned. All the patients provided written informed consent before participation. Key exclusion criteria were type 1 or 2 diabetes, the use of medications that cause clinically significant weight gain or loss, previous bariatric surgery, a history of pancreatitis, a history of major depressive or other severe psychiatric disorders, and a family or personal history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 or familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. Eligible participants were randomized 2:1 to once_daily subcutaneous injections of either liraglutide or placebo using a computer_generated, centrally administered procedure. Patients, investigators, and the sponsor were unaware of the study_group assignments. The primary endpoint was change in bodyweight during the 28 weeks of the study in the intention_to_treat population. The proportion of people losing more than 5% of baseline weight was also assessed. Secondary efficacy endpoints included the proportion of people losing more than 10% of baseline weight was also assessed, change in waist circumference, hip circumference, WHR, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting lipids (total cholesterol, low_density lipoprotein cholesterol, high_density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides), glucose metabolism parameters (fasting plasma glucose, 2_hour post_challenge plasma glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin [HbA1c])."
Nct	Randomized Trial Comparing Gastric Bypass With and Without Cholecystectomy	2020		CN-02091122	"We suggest performing a prospective randomized pilot trial comparing RYGB without concomitant cholecystectomy with RYGB with concomitant cholecystectomy for patients with absence of gallstones in preoperative ultrasound. Patients with ultrasonographically confirmed gallstones in the gallbladder undergo concomitant cholecystectomy at time of RYGB and are excluded from the study.Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized according to a randomization list generated by the CRC of the University Hospital of Geneva. The randomization envelops will be opened by the study staff at the appropriate time prior to the scheduling of gastric bypass after subject selection. The randomization assignment insert will contain information specifying whether the cholecystectomy will be performed or not during gastric bypass procedure. A total of 90 consecutive obese patients attending the Unit of Visceral Surgery of the University Hospital of Geneva who meet the criteria for bariatric surgery and where the preoperative ultrasound confirms absence of gallstones will be recruited for the study. A prospective open randomized pilot study design will be used. At 6 follow_up visits (at discharge, 1 ,3 ,6 ,12 and 18 months post_surgery), patients will be evaluated. This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki, the ICH_GCP or ISO EN 14155 as wella s all national legal and regulatory requirements, the LPth (Loi sur les produits thrapeutiques 812.21) and the OClin (Ordonnance sur les essais cliniques des produits thrapeutiques 812.214.2). Description of surgical technique One optical trocar, three 12 mm trocars and one 5 mm trocar are placed. No additional trocar has to be placed for concomitant cholecystectomy. The intervention will start with the cholecystectomy laparoscopically. A small gastric pouch (around 20_30 cc) is created using blue cartridge staplers. A standard robotic RYGB with a 75 cm biliary limb and a 150 cm antecolic alimentary limb is performed. A hand_sewn gastrojejunal and jejunojejunal anastomois are performed, using a single layer running suture of Vicryl 2.0. Data Collection: Pre_Operative demographic data and other variables will be collected at baseline and at some of the 6 follow_up points (at discharge, 1,3,6,12,18 months): Ultrasound, Patient Demographics and pre_Operative History will be collected, including: Gender, age on admission for operation, BMI, Height, Weight, ASA score, history of abdominal surgery, co_ morbidities (Type 2 diabetes requiring Insulin or oral medication), Hypertension requiring medication, Coronary heart disease, including history of myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, coronary artery surgery Pulmonary comorbidities including history of pulmonary embolism, Sleep Apnea Tobacco use, Medication used by patient, Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, Fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, laboratory findings, QOL using the EQ_5D_5L questionnaire Intra_Operative Assessment: Intra_Operative data such as complications (organ lesion, bleeding, conversion), operative time, docking times, estimated blood loss will be collected Post_Operative Assessment: From surgery to discharge, the following patient information will be collected: complications according to Clavien/Dindo Classification system, re_ operation, re_admission, length of hospital stay Our hypothesis is that the approach without cholecystectomy would be superior in terms of a decrease of perioperative adverse events and postoperative complications, as well as lenght of operation, lenght of hospital stay, overall costs with a very low risk of biliary complication in the follow up."
Nct	A Trial Evaluating the Effectiveness of Contrave in Patients Who Have Weight Recidivism Following Bariatric Surgery	2020		CN-02182059	"Obesity is associated with increased mortality and morbidity and represents a worldwide epidemic that is increasing in prevalence and remains a significant problem in Canada and a burden on our healthcare system. Maintaining long_term weight loss is the ""Achilles' heel"" of obesity therapy. Treatment for obesity with surgery is increasing because it has been shown to produce the best results for long_term weight loss and improving obesity related risk factors and diseases. But, these benefits are often reduced by inadequate weight loss or by weight regain in many patients after surgery. Contrave (naltrexone HCl and bupropion HCl) extended_release tablet is an approved drug and indicated to be used with a low calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in obese adults (BMI 30 Kg/m2 or greater) or overweight adults (BMI 27 Kg/m2 or greater) with at least one weight related condition such as hypertension or diabetes. It is unknown how many or which medical treatments for weight loss, such as Contrave work in the subjects who have had bariatric surgery. This is a 1 year, phase 4, prospective, randomized, double_blind, placebo controlled study that will be conducted across multiple Bariatric Centres of Excellence (BCoE) in Ontario. Consenting participants will be randomly assigned to receive Contrave with usual care (dietary and behaviour counselling) or placebo with usual care. All subjects will also continue to receive usual care. The study includes several follow up visits to assess safety and treatment effects, some in person and others by telephone or video conferencing. Body weight, blood pressure, heart rate, waist circumference, lab tests, and subject completed questionnaires will be collected as part of usual care or for the study. Changes in medications and any possible side effects will also be monitored during the study. To qualify, men and women must have had prior bariatric surgery (roux en_y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy) at a surgical Center of Excellence within the Ontario Bariatric Network, and have inadequate weight loss or significant weight regain, based on the following OBN criteria: 1. < 10% total body weight (TBW) loss at 6 months or; 2. < 20% TBW loss at 12 months or; 3.

Nct	Dose of Magnesium Sulfate Infusion in Obese	2020		CN-02205940	"After approval by the Research Ethics Committee and registration of the project at ClinicalTrials (www.ClinicalTrials.gov) 75 patients will be selected from a population of obese patients scheduled for laparoscopic, bariatric or cholecystectomy surgery, who voluntarily accept to participate in the study. These participants will be distributed through an electronic draw in three groups. In the lactate ringer group (LRG), patients who will receive only general anesthesia will be grouped. In the real weight group (RWG) will be the patients who will receive general anesthesia and magnesium sulfate infused at a dose of 15 mg.kg_1.h_1 based on the actual body weight. In the corrected ideal weight group (CWG) will be the patients who will receive general anesthesia and the same dose of magnesium sulfate, but based on the corrected ideal weigh. Inclusion criteria: patients aged 18 to 60 years, status I or II of the American Society of Anesthesiology, body mass index> 30 kg.m_2, scheduled for laparoscopic, bariatric surgery or cholecystectomy. Patients with allergies to any of the components of the protocol, who refuse to participate or sign the consent form, presenting neuromuscular impairment, heart block greater than first_degree atrioventricular block, using illicit drugs, with neuropsychiatric impairment, in blockers calcium channels and with renal impairment will not be invited to participate in the study. A pre_trial phase will include 10 patients with a body mass index between 20 and 30 kg / m_. These patients will receive magnesium sulfate infusion at a dose of 15 mg.kg_1h_1, and serial samples will be collected (before administration, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min after administration) for comparison with the trial patients. For this study, the sample size was determined to a level of 95% confidence, power equal to 80% and effect size of 0.40, a sample of 22 individuals was calculated for each of the 3 groups, adding a total of 66 participants. We rounded up to 25 participants per group to compensate for losses, with a total of 75 participants. The result of the group draw will be kept hidden for participants and the team. Each participant will have an opaque envelope with their name and number corresponding to the order of entry into the study. The group each patient belongs to and the medication to be administered according to the group will be described on an identification card inside the envelope. A team member will be responsible for opening the envelope and preparing the medication to be administered, keeping the secret to the other study participants. Participants will not receive pre_anesthetic medication. Upon arriving at the operating room, they will be monitored with continuous electrocardioscope, pulse oximetry, non_invasive blood pressure and monitoring of the level of consciousness. When the venous catheter is installed, the first blood sample (2 ml) will be collected to measure blood magnesium concentration. After blood collection, an infusion of the study comparison solution will be started as described below. LRG _ Ringer with lactate 16 ml.h_1 RWG _ magnesium sulfate 15 mg.kg_1.h_1 based on the patient's real weight CWG _ magnesium sulfate 15 mg / kg / h based on the patient's corrected ideal weight. A professional will be assigned to prepare the syringe and pump to administer the substance in a covered manner to the patient and other team members. The infusion will be stopped at the end of the surgery. The professional who deals with the pump and substance corresponding to the patient's group will not participate in another stage of the study. At the time of induction, all participants in the 3 groups will receive dipyrone 10 mg.kg_1, clonidine 2 µg.kg_1, cefazolin 2 g, dexamethasone 4 mg, ketoprofen 100 mg, ranitidine 50 mg, lidocaine 1.5 mg.kg_1. Pre_oxygenation with inspired fraction of 100% oxygen will be initiated for 3 min, followed by propofol in target_controlled infusion (TCI _ target controlled infusion) with initial target at 4 µg.ml_1 (p armacokinetic model Marsh, with target effect) guided by the monitoring of anesthetic depth. At that moment, the muscle relaxation monitor (TOF _ train of four) will be calibrated, followed by the administration of 0.1 mg of cisatracurium and the start of remifentanil infusion in TCI to an effect concentration of 5 ng.ml_1. Anesthesia maintenance will be based on propofol in TCI guided by anesthetic depth monitoring, remifentanil (target 3 to 5 ng.ml_1) and cisatracurium 0.03 mg.kg_1 if TOF ³ 2. There will be no additional dose of cisatracurium in the last 20 minutes surgery, unless necessary by the surgeon. The infusion of remifentanil will be controlled to prevent systolic blood pressure from reaching values greater than or less than 30% of baseline values, or a maximum of 130 mmHg and a minimum of 90 mmHg. At the end of surgery, after TOF> 2, patients will receive atropine 20 µg.kg_1 and neostigmine 40 µg.kg_1. Blood will be collected to examine the blood concentration of magnesium in all patients in the 3 groups at the time of venipuncture and 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min after the beginning of the covered solution. Before extubation, all patients will receive an intravenous dose of morphine 0.05 mg.kg_1 and dipyrone 10 mg.kg_1. Five minutes after extubation, and then every 30 min, this dose of morphine will be repeated in case of pain greater than 3 on the verbal pain scale (scale from 0 to 10). The following will be recorded and analyzed: 1. Blood concentrations of magnesium at the moments described 2. Consumption of painkillers upon awakening and during hospital stay 3. Cisatracurium latency (from injection to TOF = 0) 4. Cisatracurium duration 25 (from injection to TOF = 25%) 5. Total duration of cisatracurium (from injection to TOF = 90%) 6. Cisatracurium recovery index (between TOF 25% and 75%)"
Nct	Hesperidin and Diosmin for Treatment of COVID-19	2020		CN-02134028	"Research Background and Rationale At the end of December 2019, pneumonia of unknown origin was detected in the hospitals of Wuhan city, China, and reported to the WHO country office for the first time [1_3]. After a few days, the Chinese government has confirmed the human_to_human transmission of the new infectious respiratory disease [4]. At the end of January 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS_CoV_2), as an international public health emergency. The disease termed coronavirus 19 (COVID_19) rapidly transmitted from China to all over the world and subsequently the WHO declared it a global pandemic disease. The virulent virus structure is closely related to (SARS_CoV) strain with a single_stranded positive_sense RNA composition[5]. This pandemic disease is particularly of major importance to the whole world and especially to countries with a heavy population like Egypt. There is a critical need for emergent, continuous, and cost_effective health care delivery to infected people. Early detection and strategies for prevention of progression of COVID_19 would make a major difference for infected patients and would also be economically beneficial for a resource_constrained country. People infected with COVID_19 may have no symptoms but still, act as a source of infection to other surrounding persons. The most common clinical manifestations following infection range from mild symptoms of (generalized fatigue, dry cough, low_grade fever, and sore throat) to severe symptoms of (typical severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pneumonia)[6]. Although the tremendous scientific research effort is focusing mainly on the use of antiviral drugs, certain drug repurposing, and vaccine production for the treatment of COVID_19 patients, there is no specific cure or vaccine for treatment up till now. New drug development is a time_consuming process so that drug repositioning may be the optimum solution to control this pandemic infection. Selected Drugs Hesperidin is a common flavone glycoside found in citrus fruit such as lemons and sweet oranges[7, 8]. Hesperidin has several pharmacological activities such as anti_atherogenic, antihyperlipidemic, antidiabetic, venotonic, cardioprotective, anti_inflammatory, and antihypertensive actions. The anti_inflammatory activity of hesperidin was mainly attributed to its antioxidant defense mechanism and suppression of pro_inflammatory cytokine production[7]. Hesperidin exhibited anti_viral activity against the influenza virus through a significant reduction of virus replication. Treatment of infected cells with hesperidin enhanced cell_autonomous immunity via activation and upregulation of p38 and JNK expression which is essential for cell defense mechanisms against influenza virus[9]. Hesperidin has been used as an herbal medicine for a long time. The safety of hesperidin was confirmed by FASEB (Federation of American Societies of Experimental Biology) upon request of the FDA. Toxicity studies have confirmed the high safety profile of hesperidin after oral intake. Results from oral toxicity studies showed the absence of adverse side effects after oral hesperidin ingestion of more than 2g /kg [10]. Hesperidin role in prevention and treatment of COVID 19 was recently published by our research team in Medical Hypotheses journal [12]. Contraindications of (Hesperidin and Diosmin mixture, Daflon¨) No reported contraindications. Interactions of (Hesperidin and Diosmin mixture, Daflon¨) No sever drug_drug interactions, only moderate and minor interactions _ Celiprolol: (Moderate drug_drug interaction) Hesperidin may reduce the absorption of celiprolol. _ Diltiazem: (Moderate drug_drug interaction) Hesperidin may reduce the absorption of diltiazem. Daflon 500 mg is a marketed tablet dosage form containing a micronized flavonoid mixture of 50 mg of hesperidin and 450 mg of diosmin which used as vasoprotective venotonic agent[10]. This hesperidin mixtur is characterized by its high safety profile. Continues oral administration for hesperidin mixture to rats for 13 and 26 weeks, using a very high dose of 35_fold of the daily dosage showed no toxicity with a high LD50 value of more than 3 g/kg body weight. Clinical trials used more than 2850 patients treated with the hesperidin mixture for a period of 6 weeks to 1 year showed normal hematological parameters, hepatic and renal functions with no signs of toxicity[11]. Unraveling host cellular receptors used for cellular entry of COVID_19 will provide possible lines for attack. Cell entry of COVID_19 depends on two consecutive steps, firstly binding of the viral spike (S_protein) to host cellular receptors followed by priming of S_protein by cell proteases. Recently, researchers showed that COVID_19 uses the ACE_2 receptor for entry [13] and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for priming of S_protein. Camostat mesylate, a serine protease inhibitor drug blocked virus entry and was used as a COVID_19 treatment in Japan[14]. COVID_19 binds to the ACE_2 receptor through its specific Spike_receptor binding domain (RBD) sequence to form the SARS_CoV_2_RBD_ACE_2 complex. The proposed computational activity of 78 anti_viral drugs against the human ACE2 receptor was screened using homology modeling. This study showed that hesperidin is the only compound that could target the binding interface between SARS_CoV_2 Spike and ACE2 human receptors. based on virtual screening, hesperidin may disrupt the interaction of ACE2 with RBD of SARS_CoV_2 thus block its entry into the lung cells [15]. Therefore, hesperidin can be used as a promising prophylactic agent against COVID_19 infection. Host antiviral responses against COVIDððð19 infection depend on the activation of both the immune systems and cellular self_defense mechanisms. Immunity plays a major role in the protection of the host against viral infection. The occurrence of immune over_response or immune deficiency is responsible for the condition of infected patients becoming critical or severe[16]. The anti_viral activity of hesperidin against the influenza virus involves its role in the activation of the mitogen_activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The MAPK host defense cascade contributes to efficiently restraining viral replication, spread, and minimizing tissue damage[9]. A recent study showed that the interferon_MAPK pathway played an important role in the COVID_19 immune response[16]. Therefore, hesperidin by its activation to host immunity my help against COVID_19 viral replication and hence its progression which will improve the patient outcome. Patients infected with COVID_19 exhibited what is called ""cytokine storm"" which initiated primarily as an inflammatory response and resulted in uncontrolled over_production of soluble markers of inflammation. Available evidence showing that cytokine storm, is a major cause for the development of ARDS. Cytokine storm involves the release of various immune_active molecules such as Interferons (e.g. IFN_), interleukins (e.g. IL_1_, IL_2, IL_6), chemokines, and tumor necrosis factor_alpha (TNF__ ) [17]. _ Verapamil: (Moderate drug_drug interaction) Hesperidin may increase the absorption of verapamil. _ Antihypertensive drugs: (Moderate drug_drug interaction) Hesperidin may lower high blood pressure might cause your blood pressure to go too low. _ Anticoagulant / Antiplatelet drugs: (Moderate drug_drug interaction) Hesperidin may slow blood clotting which might increase the chances of bruising and bleeding. _ Sedative medications (Benzodiazepines) (Moderate drug_drug interaction) Hesperidin may cause too much sleepiness. Hesperidin with its high anti_inflammatory activity inhibited the secretion of pro_inflammatory cytokines such as IFN__ and IL_2[18]. Besides, hesperidin inhibited IL 1_ stimulated inflammatory responses by inhibiting the activation of the NF _B signaling cascade[19]. It also played a major rule in suppressing the rel ase of inflammatory markers such as (TNF_ and IL_6) in type 2 diabetic patients[20]. Therefore, it can be used as adjuvant therapy to control the severe inflammatory reaction against COVID_19. Activation of coagulation pathways following the immune response to COVID_19 infection promotes clot formation. The proposed mechanism of formation of micro thrombosis involves the occurrence of procoagulant_anticoagulant imbalance, platelet activation, and converting fibrinogen to fibrin. Disseminated intravascular coagulation predisposes to the development of multiorgan failure especially in severe infected cases[21]. A prophylactic dose of heparin (with low molecular weight, LMWH) is recommended for protection against venous thromboembolism in COVID_19 hospitalized patients[21]. In this context, it is essential to highlight the role of concomitant administration of hesperidin and diosmin mixture with heparin for protection against thromboembolism. Results from previous clinical trials that used Daflon 500 mg with LMWH confirmed the significant effect of this combination compared to LMWH alone in preventing the incidence of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. Therefore, co_administration of LMWH and Daflon 500 mg can significantly inhibit clot formation and prevent disease progression [22]. Diagnostic criteria The viral research institution in China has conducted preliminary identification of the SARS_CoV_2 through the classical Koch's postulates and observing its morphology through electron microscopy[1]. So far, the golden clinical diagnosis method of COVID_19 is nucleic acid detection in the nasal and throat swab sampling or other respiratory tract samplings by real_time PCR and further confirmed by next_generation sequencing Clinical classification of patients Patients can be grouped into three categories: asymptomatic, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) when presenting with rhinitis, pharyngitis, or isolated low_grade fever and myalgia, and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) when presenting with symptoms of pneumonia or bronchitis[3]. Side effects of (Hesperidin and Diosmin mixture, Daflon¨) Like all medicines, Daflon 500 mg can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Some cases of commonplace gastrointestinal disorders and neurovegetative disorders (feeling of discomfort) have been described, which do not require stopping the treatment. Safety concerns of (Hesperidin and Diosmin mixture, Daflon¨) Daflon 500 mg tablets is POSSIBLY SAFE for most people when taken by mouth for up to 6 months. The safety of using it for a longer period of time is unknown. Side effects include stomach pain and upset, diarrhea, and headache. Special Precautions & Warnings: _ Pregnancy and breast_feeding: Hesperidin is POSSIBLY SAFE for pregnant or breast_feeding women when taken by mouth with diosmin. _ Bleeding disorder: Hesperidin might slow blood clotting and increase the risk of bleeding. In theory, hesperidin might make bleeding disorders worse. _ Low blood pressure: Hesperidin might lower blood pressure. In theory, taking hesperidin might make blood pressure become too low in people who already have low blood pressure. _ Surgery: Hesperidin might prolong bleeding. There is concern that hesperidin might increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgical procedures. Stop taking hesperidin at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery. Research Objectives This research proposal was employed as a practical strategy for providing a suitable drug or drug combination for possible treatment of COVID_19 infected patients. This drug may help to prevent the progression of respiratory complications. This can be achieved through different goals as following: 1. Screening of different drugs related to different pharmacological classes depending on its possible activity against COVID_19 virus. 2.

Nct	Sirolimus Coated Angioplasty Versus Plain Balloon Angioplasty	2020		CN-02125057	"Dialysis vascular accesses such as Arteriovenous Fistula (AVF) and Arteriovenous Grafts (AVG) are surgically created vasculatures used for hemodialysis in patients with End_Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). A functioning dialysis vascular access is critical to the delivery of life_saving hemodialysis (HD) treatment to these patients. Unfortunately, neointimal hyperplasia frequently occurs within the dialysis vascular access, resulting in stenosis, poor flow and thrombosis with loss of function. The durability of both AVF and AVG are poor, with an almost 50% failure rate after a median lifetime of 3 to 7 years for AVF and 12 to 18 months for AVG. Vascular access failure is the most common reason for hospitalization among HD patients. The global healthcare costs for treating vascular access_related complications amount to USD 18 billion, and in USD 1 billion in the US alone. These figures are set to increase, due to the increase in the prevalence of access interventions and hemodialysis patients globally. Singapore has one of the highest ESRD rates in the world and the investigators are facing an increasing number of patients with ESRD and the majority of the patients opting for hemodialysis as their treatment modality. As such, vascular access_related complication is set to be a major contribution of healthcare cost in our nation. The current gold standard therapy for the treatment of stenosis in dialysis access is plain balloon angioplasty (BA). Despite its widespread availability and minimally invasive nature, the mid_ and long_term patency with BA in patients with ESRD is poor. The reported average primary patency after BA is around 40_50% at 1 year. Multiple repeated angioplasty is required to maintain the patency of the vascular access. Hence, there is an urgent clinical need to improve the patency of dialysis vascular access. Recently, the use of stents, in particular stent graft, has been shown to be superior to angioplasty for stenosis occurring at the site of venous anastomoses of an AVG. The incidence of patency of the treatment area was significantly greater in the stent_graft group than in the balloon_angioplasty group (51% vs. 23%, P<0.001), as was the incidence of patency of the access circuit (38% vs. 20%, P=0.008) at 6 months. For cephalic arch stenosis in AVF, the use of stent graft has also been shown to be superior to bare metal stent. The 6 month primary patency for stent graft and bare stent was 81.8 and 39.1%, respectively. One_year primary patency for stent graft and bare stent was 31.8 and 0.00%, respectively (P = 0.002). However, the use of stent graft for the management of dialysis vascular access is not without any concern. In particular, re_stenosis can occur within the stented segment (post stent 12_month primary patency is 46%), resulting in the need for repeat angioplasty. Future stent deployment in the re_stenotic segment may also not be feasible due to the presence of the stent. Moreover, the presence of a stent can impede future surgical revision or new access creation within the same vessel. Sirolimus coated balloon (SCB) is the new generation of drug_eluting balloons available in the market. Compared to Paclitaxel, sirolimus is cytostatic in its mode of action with a high margin of safety. It has a high transfer rate to the vessel wall and effectively inhibits neointimal hyperplasia in the porcine coronary model. In the coronary artery interventions, preliminary clinical studies using SCB have also shown excellent procedural and 6_month patency. RECRUITMENT: STUDY PROCEDURE: Randomisation occurs when all the lesions are treated adequately, defined as less than 25% residual stenosis after standard treatment. POST_PROCEDURE ULTRASOUND SCAN: * Patency definitions are defined based on SIR reporting standards (Gray et al., 2003): Paclitaxel_coated balloon angioplasty (PCBA) has also been shown recently to be superior to plain BA in the treatment of stenosis in dialysis vascular access. This is because the very intervention used to treat the underlying steno is by plain BA can induce vascular injury and accelerate intimal hyperplasia, resulting in rapid restenosis and the need for repeated procedures to maintain vessel patency. By releasing Paclitaxel, which is an anti_proliferative drug, locally into the vessel wall during balloon contact, it will blunt the acceleration of intimal hyperplasia response, resulting in improved primary patency after angioplasty. Additionally, unlike stents, PCBA does not leave a permanent structure that may impede future surgical revision. In a small 40 patient pilot study, the primary unassisted patency in the PCBA group was significantly better than the plain BA group at 6 (70 % versus 25 %) and 12 months (35 % versus 5 %, p <0.001) respectively. Recent randomized control trials have also shown the superiority of PCBA over plain balloon angioplasty in the treatment of stenosis in dialysis vascular access. However, concerns had also arisen recently in the use of PCBA. In large lower limb studies involving the use of PCBA, meta_analysis had revealed an increased risk of death in patients that are treated with PCBA or paclitaxel_coated stent. This had led to warning from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the issue of guidelines from the interventional societies The effectiveness of SCB in patients with dialysis access dysfunction has been shown in a small pilot study in the salvage of thrombosed AVG and investigators postulate that SCB will be a viable option in patients who requires treatment with drug_coated balloon. The investigators aim to conduct a multicenter double_blinded randomized controlled trial to compare the 6 month unassisted patency rate of SCB angioplasty versus plain balloon angioplasty in the management of stenosis in arteriovenous fistula. Patients with matured AVF (in use for more than 1 month) that are dysfunctional and are already scheduled to undergo balloon angioplasty will be considered for the trial. Patients will be consented if they fulfill the preliminary eligibility criteria and are agreeable to participate in the study. Once all the eligibility criteria are fulfilled, including angiographic criteria assessed on the day of the procedure, the patient is entered into the trial and randomised. Patients who are unsuitable for the trial will be treated in the conventional way with PB and considered as screen failure. The AVF will be assessed with ultrasound for possible access sites. All patients will undergo a fistulogram which is obtained by injection of contrast. The access site will be left to the discretion of the procedurist. The fistulogram should include the entire dialysis circuit from the arteriovenous anastomosis to the central veins. The suggested approach would include a fistulogram via an 18 Gauge cannula inserted into the arterialised vein. When there is no spontaneous reflux of contrast into the artery, reflux opacification of the arteriovenous (AV) anastomosis is achieved by injecting contrast during inflation of a blood pressure cuff or a tourniquet around the arm. Alternatively, a trans_radial or arterial approach may be used to obtain the fistulogram Post_intervention target lesion patency: Post_intervention access circuit primary patency: Post_intervention access circuit assisted primary patency: Based on fistulogram findings, the access site will be placed up to the discretion of the procedurist. If an 18G cannula is used, it may be exchanged for a vascular sheath that is sized appropriately based on the planned balloon sizes). Alternatively, the 18G cannula may be removed and a new access site for intervention may be chosen. A new puncture will be performed with the insertion of a vascular sheath (sized appropriately according to planned balloon sizes). Two access sites (both antegrade and retrograde) may be needed in certain cases. A trans_radial or arterial approach may also be considered if necessary In the event that opacification of the anastomosis was not earlier achieved even with inflation of a blood pressure cuff around the arm, it will be perfor ed via contrast injection through a catheter in the feeding artery. When there is more than 1 stenosis, all the lesions will be labelled and treated with conventional balloon angioplasty (from the AV anastomosis up to, but not including, the subclavian vein). Lesions are considered separate if they are separated by a gap of at least 2 cm. The lesion or lesions will be dilated with standard angioplasty that is sized similar to the adjacent reference vessel. Inflation time will be at least 1 minute per inflation. The balloon will be inflated to an appropriate inflation pressure as per institution standardised practice to achieve <25% residual stenosis and satisfactory thrill. If there is significant residual stenosis after angioplasty (defined as > 25% stenosis), repeat angioplasty with the same standard angioplasty balloon or a larger standard angioplasty balloon may be used at operator's discretion. High_pressure angioplasty balloon or cutting balloon may also be used, if necessary, in the event of resistant stenosis. In stenotic segment adjacent to aneurysmal segment, where the percentage of stenosis is difficult to determine, the treated segment should reach at least reach 6mm. Patients will be randomised to receive either the sirolimus coated balloon or plain balloon. Repeated angioplasty of the stenotic segments that were successfully treated (defined as less than 25% residual stenosis) will be performed using sirolimus coated balloon (for patient randomised into the sirolimus balloon arm) or plain/placebo balloon (for patients randomised into the placebo arm) All participants will receive an ultrasound scan of their AVF after their procedure before discharge. The diameter of the vessel at the treated sites will be measured and documented. Brachial artery flow and flow within the outflow vein will also be measured and documented Interval after intervention until the next re_intervention at or adjacent to the original treatment site or until the access is abandoned. Percutaneous or surgical treatments of a new arterial or venous outflow stenosis/occlusion (including access thrombosis) that do not involve or exclude the original lesion from the access circuit are compatible with lesion patency. The creation of new access that incorporates the target lesion into the new access circuit is also compatible with target lesion patency. Interval following intervention until the next access thrombosis or repeated intervention. It ends with the treatment of a lesion anywhere within the access circuit, from the arterial inflow to the superior vena cava_right atrial junction. Interval after intervention until access thrombosis or surgical intervention that excludes the treated lesion from the access circuit. Percutaneous treatments of either restenosis/occlusion of the previously treated lesion or a new arterial or venous outflow stenosis/occlusion (excluding access thrombosis) are compatible with assisted primary patency. Post_intervention access circuit secondary patency: Interval after intervention until the access is surgically declotted, revised or abandoned. Thrombolysis and percutaneous thrombectomy are compatible with secondary patency. ^Complications will be categorised according to SIR definitions of minor or major complications (Aruny et al., 2003): A major complication is defined as one that: 1. require therapy, minor hospitalisation (< 48 hours), 2. require major therapy, unplanned increase in the level of care, prolonged hospitalisation (>48 hours), 3. leads to permanent adverse sequelae, or 4. death A minor complication is one that: 1. requires no therapy with no consequence, 2. requires nominal therapy with no consequence; includes overnight admission for observation only. POST_PROCEDURE FOLLOW_UP ULTRASOUND SCAN OF AVF: Patients will be followed_up at: 3 months (± 1 weeks): assessment of primary outcome 6 months (± 4 weeks): assess the target lesion and access circuit. 12 months (± 4 weeks): assess AVF patency and study closure"
Nct	Low-Calorie Diet in People With Prediabetes/Metabolic Syndrome	2021		CN-02249663	"Prediabetes affects up to 35% of the population. It is defined as an intermediate metabolic state of glucose dysregulation between normoglycaemia and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Prediabetic individuals have 3_12 times higher annual incidence of type 2 diabetes than the general population. Further, these individuals have a considerable increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), (myocardial infarction, stroke, CV death) and even in the absence of coronary artery disease, an increased risk of heart failure. Individuals with prediabetes manifest the same clustering of cardiovascular risk factors (dysglycaemia, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, obesity, physical inactivity, insulin resistance, pro_coagulant state, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation) that confer the high risk for macrovascular complications in type 2 diabetes. For example, 37% and 51% of individuals with prediabetes have hypertension and dyslipidaemia. Results of large randomised control trials focusing on diabetes management have shown improvements in cardiovascular and renal outcomes and treatments for patients with established type 2 diabetes. Studies examining cardiovascular and renal burdens in patients with prediabetes have demonstrated that the same therapeutic benefits have not been observed in adults with prediabetes. This study focuses on a younger age group considering the aggressive phenotype of young_onset type 2 diabetes as it provides the opportunity to address and effectively manage the associated cardio_metabolic risk factors, prevent progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes and reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease, heart failure and liver_related burden. Liver fat predicts both cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes independent of obesity. NAFLD is a growing clinical problem which has become the most prevalent chronic liver disease in Western society. It can be associated with isolated hepatic triglyceride accumulation (steatosis), through steatosis plus hepatocellular damage with inflammation and fibrosis (non_alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which may ultimately progress to liver fibrosis/cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Non_Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is considered the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome and is commonly associated with insulin_resistant states including obesity, a higher prevalence of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (T2D). NAFLD has a bi_directional relationship with prediabetes and T2D being a risk factor for Non_Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease but conversely, individuals with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes have significantly increased liver fat versus non_diabetic control subjects with a higher risk of NAFLD than Body Mass Index (BMI) _matched non_diabetic controls. NAFLD is associated with a metabolic phenotype similar to that observed in T2D: hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance with reduced skeletal muscle glucose uptake and increased non_esterified fatty acid (NEFA) release from adipose tissue lipolysis. Once liver fat accumulates in the liver, insulin is unable to inhibit glucose and very_low_density lipoprotein (VLDL) production resulting in overproduction of glucose and very_low_density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles leading to hypertriglyceridaemia and low high_density lipoprotein (HDL)_cholesterol concentrations. NAFLD is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease with CVD now representing the leading cause of death in NAFLD. While it remains contentious whether the increased risk of CVD in NAFLD is explained by the combination of common risk factors shared by both NAFLD and CVD, most epidemiological studies evaluating CVD risk in NAFLD suggest the risk occurs independently of associated risk factors. These studies have relied upon biochemical and imaging surrogate markers of NAFLD (e.g. serum liver enzymes, abdominal ultrasound). Using more detailed assessment of NAFLD e.g. assessment of fibrosis with fibrosis panels, with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or even biopsy_based. Clinical studies have hown that sustained moderate weight loss of around 5_10%, achieved through lifestyle intervention lowers blood pressure, improves glucose control, prevents diabetes, and improves dyslipidaemia, as well as improving haemostatic and fibrinolytic factors. The effects of weight reduction on progression to T2D has been studied in pre_diabetes in the Diabetes Prevention Programme study (US) study. A 1 kg of weight loss is associated with a 16% reduction in the progression of pre_diabetes to T2D. Metabolic surgery is associated with remission of T2D. There is overwhelming evidence that LCDs have a useful role in T2D resulting in substantial weight loss (mean difference in weight vs. controls after 3 months was 7.38 kg (CI: 16.2, 1.5) with high levels of adherence. They can potentially cause profound weight loss of 15_20% of body weight in severe and medically complicated obesity. The weight loss is associated with significant reductions in hepatic and pancreatic fat with associated improvements in insulin sensitivity and pancreatic §_cell function resulting in remission of T2D in many cases. This dramatic dietary intervention, initially believed to be unmanageable and difficult to maintain, has been demonstrated to be implementable and highly efficacious even when delivered through primary care settings. In one primary care study, using LCD in T2D patients recorded a weight loss of 15kg or more in 24% of patients after 12 months. It is unsurprising that 46% of the participants achieved remission of their T2D. LCD produces bariatric type weight loss and improves glycaemic control in diabetes and results in remission of T2D in the majority of patients, however the impact on complications, remains to be determined particularly in obese people without diabetes. One non_pharmacological strategy to improve cardio_metabolic health in obesity, pre_diabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) includes the application of a low_calorie diet (LCD), utilising reduced daily energy intake (<800kcal). To this extent, the purpose of this study is to examine the impact of intensive weight management on metabolic, liver and cardiac health, measures on neuropathy and on appetite regulation. The investigators will study younger (<55y) obese people with pre_diabetes and/or metabolic syndrome who exhibit early or pre_clinical evidence of metabolic and cardiovascular complications. The investigators will investigate the effects of a low_calorie diet (LCD) as one of the most effective and least invasive mechanism by which these various factors can be improved."

Nct	Timing of Endoscopic Intervention for Acute Variceal Hemorrhage: an RCT	2021		CN-02249670	"Study design In this trial, we plan to conduct a single_centered, prospective, parallel_group randomized clinical trial. The study protocol observes the Standard Protocol Items rules: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) 2013. The leader of the sponsoring organization strictly implements oversight of the protocol. We intend to compare the effectiveness of improving re_bleeding rates of cirrhotic patients with AVB between the urgent endoscopy and non_urgent endoscopy groups. Department of gastroenterology, affiliated Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University will take full charge of this trial, including recruitment of patients, endoscopic intervention, admission education, in_hospital nursing, subsequent follow_up work, etc. Informed consent forms from every patient will be signed before enrollment, and approval from the Ethical Committees of Jinling Hospital has been obtained (authorized ethic No. DZQH_KYLL_21_01). Data processing Two investigators in our department are responsible for the data collection and storage. One investigator will inspect the data collected by another one. After finishing the inspection, the data will be input in the off_line database constructed by the investigators. Instantly they complete all of the data storage, the two investigators will conduct a double inspection. The eventual data will be used for data analysis. Theoretically, there will be no missing data because the investigators will inspect and record every patient's data timely. Patients with missing data will be excluded from the trial. We will perform source data verification by comparing them with authentic medical records to assess the accuracy, completeness, or representativeness of registry data. Patients enrollment An estimated 400 patients will be consecutively included in the study between March 2021 and December 2023. Original Glasgow_Blatchford Score is used to evaluate the condition of each patient instead of modified version. The indicators (measured within 2 hours after admission) are blood urea, hemoglobin, systolic blood pressure, pulse, melena, syncope, hepatic disease, and cardiac failure. Sample size According to research from Ardevol A et al, in the 646 cirrhotic patients with AVB performing endoscopy within 6h after admission, the 45_day re_bleeding rate was 26%, the results of which was similar to that in another research by Ping_Hsien Chen (the overall 6_week re_bleeding rate for cirrhotic patients with AVB was 25.7%). Then, we hypothesized a difference of 14% would be clinically significant in re_bleeding rate. Next, we calculated at least 189 patients in each group would embody the discrepancy (26% vs. 40%), with the statistical power of 80% and a two_sided _ level of 5%. Assuming that a certain number of patients in each group will be lost to follow_up, a minimum of about 200 patients would be necessary for each group. Randomization and time set Eligible patients are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive endoscopic intervention either within 6h or 6_24h. Randomization is conducted by permuted block randomization stratified by age, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and heart rate (HR). The block size is pre_specified, but physicians and investigators are not notified of this during the study. Allocation concealment is implemented by the mobile client randomization tool ""Randomization Allocation Tool (RAT)"". There are two primary sources of patients. The majority of these patients are from the emergency department, and the others are patients with cirrhosis who developed AVB during hospitalization. For patients from the emergency department, the interval between admission and receiving gastroenterological consultation will be controlled within 10 minutes by applying the emergency green channel. However, for patients during hospitalization, the time should be calculated as receiving an evaluation by the emergency endoscopic team (gastroenterological consultation). In order to make it easier to record, the time will be uniformly ca culated as receiving gastroenterological consultation, whatever the sources of patients are. The patients will be randomly allocated to undergo urgent endoscopy within 6h or non_urgent endoscopy between 6h and 24h after gastroenterological consultation. The following time data will be recorded: (I) time from presenting with symptoms of acute variceal bleeding to admission (patients from the emergency department); (II) time from admission to gastroenterological consultation (patients from the emergency department); (III) time from admission to endoscopy (patients from the emergency department); (IV) time from presentation to gastroenterological consultation (patients develop AVB during hospitalization); (V) time from gastroenterological consultation to endoscopy (all of the patients). Control of acute bleeding, persistent bleeding, and re_bleeding AVB under endoscopy refers to bleed gushing or seeping from esophageal or gastric varices. Control of AVB refers to persistent bleeding signs that do not occur within 24h after the initial endoscopic intervention. Persistent bleeding refers to bleeding that can not be controlled after initial endoscopic intervention within 24h. Persistent bleeding is defined as follows (at least one item appears): (I) vomiting of fresh blood or suction of more than 100 ml fresh blood from the nasogastric tube; (II) occurring hemorrhagic shock; (III) review of hemoglobin level decreasing by 30 g/L in the absence of a blood transfusion. Re_bleeding refers to recurrent bleeding after control of acute bleeding. The re_bleeding is defined as follows (at least one item appears): (I) hematemesis/melena/hematochezia; (II) with systolic blood pressure dropping by more than 20mmHg from the original level or heart rate increases by 20 beats/min; (III) review of hemoglobin level decreasing by 30 g/L in the absence of a blood transfusion. Patients with persistent or re_bleeding will take secondary endoscopic intervention or be transferred to undergo other treatment (surgery or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent_shunt [TIPSS]) instantaneously according to the patient's condition. Treatment (I) Before endoscopic intervention: all the patients take uninterrupted intravenous administration of high dose proton pump inhibitors (PPIs, 8 mg/h), somatostatin (250 _g/h), and preventive application of antibiotics; (II) Initial endoscopic intervention: patients who conform to non_variceal bleeding under endoscopy will not be included in this trial, but the emergency endoscopic team will still strictly follow the procedure to conduct standard treatment for them. For patients conforming to AVB, we use tissue adhesive/sclerotherapy/variceal ligation/covered stent as the treatment methods for varicose veins. The patient's position is chosen to expose the best field of vision under endoscopy, and the external cannula for endoscopy is used to prevent aspiration according to the patient's condition. Furthermore, initial endoscopic treatment aim at the varicose vein of the bleeding site solely. After the endoscopic treatment, the patients will be transferred to the gastroenterological care unit; (III) After the initial endoscopic intervention: all the patients are treated with continuous high dose PPIs (8 mg/h) and intravenous infusion of somatostatin (250 _g/h) for 72h, with the preventive application of antibiotics for no more than 120h; during the follow_up, oral propranolol and ultrasound_guided tissue glue injection therapy could be used as secondary prevention according to the patient's condition; (IV) The emergency endoscopic team consists of three experienced endoscopists, each with more than ten years of experience in endoscopy and over 500 cases of variceal hemostasis under endoscopy. Also, there are several seasoned endoscopic nurses included, who have experience in endoscopic work for more than five years, are proficient in applying endoscopic treatment instruments, and cooperate with endoscopists. Follow_up time After randomization, the follow_up work will begin. All the patients ncluded will be followed up to no less than 42 days after control of AVB. When patients' conditions are stable, further treatment of varicose veins should be decided according to their wishes and statutory agents. Patients with good compliance will take standard endoscopic treatment every 3_4 weeks after control of AVB or re_bleeding, and the follow_up time should be once a week; patients who decline to accept further treatment are followed up only once a week. The follow_up forms could be either by telephone or outpatient review. If the patients are lost to follow_up during the follow_up period, the eventual outpatient review or telephone dates will be treated as the follow_up endpoints. Statistical analysis The statistical analyses are performed using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute). Continuous variables are expressed in terms of mean ± standard deviation. Student's t_test and Wilcoxon rank_sum test are applied to compare normally and non_normally distributed data, respectively. Categorical variables are compared employing Fisher's exact test. The analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint of re_bleeding rate within 42 days between the urgent endoscopy and non_urgent endoscopy groups are performed in the intention_to_treat population. The rates difference and 95% CI of the two groups are calculated with and without the randomization stratification factors. Besides, the re_bleeding rates are also estimated using the Kaplan_Meier method. The log_rank test is used to compare the difference in mortality and re_bleeding rates between the two groups. Cox proportional hazards regression model is used to estimate the hazard ratio and 95% CI. A forest plot is employed to analyze risk factors affecting mortality and re_bleeding rates. Schoenfeld residual test is applied to verify whether the model meets the proportional risk (PH) hypothesis. The secondary efficacy endpoints are assessed in the per_protocol population. There is no prespecified plan to adjust for multiple comparisons of the secondary efficacy endpoints; the analyses for secondary efficacy endpoints should not be used to infer treatment effects. Prespecified subgroup analyses include age (³40 ys or <40 ys), SBP (³100 mmHg or <100 mmHg), HR (³120 beats/min or <120 beats/min), hemoglobin (³80 g/L or <80 g/L), etc. All the P values are two_tailed, and p < 0.05 is considered to be a significant difference."
Nct	Effect of Lidocaine Versus Magnesium on Postoperative Pain in Spine Surgery	2021		CN-02249417	"This is a double_blinded prospective controlled randomized clinical trial that will be performed in Assiut university hospital. After obtaining approval from Assiut University Hospital Ethical Committee and informed written consent from patients, this study will be conducted on ASA status I, II and III patients, aged above 18y, both male and female, undergoing spinal fusion surgery (single, and double level). Subjects will be excluded if they met any of the following criteria: Previous spine surgery, morbid obesity (BMI > 40), spine metastatic tumor, allergy to an amide LA, or magnesium sulfate, heart block, renal, or liver dysfunction, or substance abuse disorder, or chronic opioid use, administration of any sedative or preexisting mental illness or electrolyte disturbance. Randomization will be performed using lidocaine group, magnesium group, combined (lidocaine and magnesium) group and control group registers, which will be placed in sealed envelopes prior to study initiation, and opened prior to anesthesia by a physician who will prepare the IV solution, and identify it with the patient number, according to the envelope drawn. The solution will be handed to another physician, blind to the prepared solutions' content, who will be responsible for the anesthesia. The solution volume will be equal. The responsible investigator will remain blind to the chosen group until the end of the study. Allocation concealment will be done using serially numbered closed, opaque envelopes. Each patient will be given a serial number from a computer_generated randomization table, and will be placed in the appropriate group after opening the corresponding sealed envelope. Counseling for participation will be conducted before recruitment. Indistinguishable syringes containing lidocaine and/or magnesium (according to doses mentioned below) or saline will be produced by the hospital pharmacy. Operative technique: Patients will be monitored with continuous electrocardiography, capnography, pulse oximetry, and intermittent non_invasive blood pressure measurements every 5 minutes. After establishment of venous access, anesthesia will be induced with propofol 2 mg/kg, fentanyl 1.5 µg/kg, cisatracurium 0.15 mg/kg. Endotracheal tube of appropriate size will be inserted and mechanical ventilation utilizing isoflurane in oxygen/air mixture at sufficient concentration to maintain systolic blood pressure within the limit of 20% baseline value. All patients will receive 30 mg ketorolac IV infusion after induction of anesthesia, Paracetamol 1g will be given by IV infusion to all patients before extubation. Reversal of residual muscle relaxant will be accomplished using neostigmine, and atropine at the end of the operation. Intraoperative fluid therapy will be administered in the form of normal saline after calculation of fasting and maintenance fluid requirements. Patients will be discharged to PACU then to the ward after fulfilling the standard criteria. No other anesthetics or sedatives will be allowed during the operation. In the first 24 hours postoperative; patients will be given Ketorolac 30 mg slowly IV (diluted to 10 ml), and paracetamol 1g injection every 8 hours; starting 8 hours after extubation. Morphine 0.1mg/kg slowly IV will be given as rescue analgesia when numeric rating scale (NRS) is ³4, or if the patient requested additional analgesia, with a minimum 8 hours interval between the 2 consecutive injections. Total doses of IV morphine will be documented. After 24 hours post_operation; paracetamol 1 g, and ketorolac 30 mg every 8 hours will be given orally for 5 days. All patients will be urged to ambulate as early as practically possible. Collected data will include patient's characteristics, and surgical data including age, gender, weight, height, duration of surgery, and duration of hospital stay. Postoperative pain evaluation during rest will be assessed by numeric rating scale (NRS). Patients' satisfaction will be assessed by using 5 points Likert score for satisfaction where 1=strongly dissatisfied; 2=Dissatisfie ; 3=neither satisfied nor dissatisfied; 4=Satisfied; 5=strongly satisfied. The two scores will be recorded at the following times: immediately at 1 h; 6 h; 12 h; 24 h; at discharge time; 1 month; 2 months, and 3 months postoperative. Time to the first request for analgesia and the total dose of rescue analgesia (morphine) in the first 24 hours after surgery will be recorded. The long_term follow_up of postoperative back pain for 3 months will be conducted through the outpatient orthopedic clinic, or by telephone. Hemodynamics and blood loss will be reported First time to pass flatus, first time to defecate and incidence of complications will also be reported (such as hypotension, bradycardia, anxiety, dizziness, muscle twitching, nervousness, reaction at the site of injection, cardiac arrest, double vision, nausea, seizures, unconsciousness, euphoria, tinnitus, vomiting). Magnesium level will be measured 6 hours after discontinuation of infusions. Testing for gross mental and neurologic defects will be performed with the Mini_Mental Status Examination, which has a standard scoring method with a maximum score of 30. The total duration of the testing will not exceed 45 minutes. Interruptions will be allowed at the request of the patient between, but not within, individual tests of the session. The tests will be administered by the same examiner to limit interexaminer variability. The anxiety and depression status will be evaluated by Self_Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self_Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and QOL will be measured by Short Form Health Survey 36 (SF_36) in eight sections, including vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, mental health, physical, emotional, and social role functioning. The study portion of the tests will be performed at least 6 hours after the initial intravenous bolus of drugs, while the control portion will be performed at least 24 hours after the studied drugs are discontinued. Tests will be repeated after 1 week and 4 weeks."
Nct	Effect of Sea Grapes-antioxidants Extract in Obese Men : 4 Weeks Randomized-Double Blind Controlled Trial	2021		CN-02307757	"The study was a 4_week, randomized, double_blind, placebo_controlled clinical trial followed by a 1_week screening period. Participants who respond to the invitation and meet the entry criteria during the telephone screening interview are scheduled for the initial visit. Evaluation during the initial visit includes physical examination in the form of BMI (Body Mass Index) based on Asia_Pacific guidelines and blood parameter screening tests in the form of blood glucose, triglycerides, high_density lipoprotein (HDL), low_density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterol, and PGC_1_ were performed on all participants within 1 week of the initial screening. A random number between 1 and 70 was generated for each subject and registered participants were scheduled for their first visit and randomly assigned to the sea grape extract group (n=35) or placebo (n=35). Sea grape extract/placebo tablets/capsules were given to participants every 1 week (1 day of consumption per oral) 15 Minutes before eating (According to the diabetes drug guidline consumtion). During the 4_week intervention period, participants were asked to continue their usual diet and not to consume functional foods or other dietary supplements. Anthropometry (BMI), Waist Hip Ratio (WHR) , blood parameters, urine profile (Marker of toxicity), and nutrient intake of both groups were measured before and after the intervention period. During the trial phase, all participants were instructed to maintain their normal diet and physical activity. Each week participants were asked to report assessments of side effects or changes in training, lifestyle, or diet; and to evaluate tablet compliance. Subjects/Participants The study participants were recruited during 2021 at Manado, Republic of Indonesia. A total of 150 participants agreed to participate in the study. Only individuals men who are obese (BMI ³ 25 kg m_2 and Waist Hip Ratio (WHR) ³ 0.90) according to Asia_Pacific guidelines and have not been diagnosed with other diseases were included in the study. To meet guidelines for evaluating the efficacy of functional food referring to the Korea Food and Drug Administration (because Indonesia does not yet exist and Koreas belong to one Asian region so used), very obese participants (BMI ³ 30 kg m_2) were not included in the study. In total, 70 participants met the research criteria (age 29.98 ± 3.26 year; weight, ..... ± .... kg; BMI, .... ±.... kg m_2) and were randomly divided into two groups (n = 35 each) given sea grape extract 1.68 g/70kg BB day_1) or placebo (1.68 g/70kg BB day_1). The exclusion criteria for this study are as follows: (a) significant weight variation (over 10%) in the last 3 months; (b) a history of cardiovascular disease including arrhythmia, heart failure, or myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus (DM) and the use of pacemakers; (c) a history of conditions that may interfere with test products or inhibit their absorption such as gastrointestinal diseases (Crohn's disease) or surgeries that have been experienced (caesarean section or enterocele); (d) participation in other clinical trials in the last 2 months; (e) abnormal liver function; (f) a history of kidney disease (eg, acute or chronic renal failure and nephrtic syndrome); (g) undergo antipsychotic drug therapy within the last 2 months; (h) laboratory test results as well as medical or psychological conditions that may interfere with successful participation in research assessed by researchers; (i) a history of alcohol or substance abuse; and (j) allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in the test product; (k) is neither a passive nor an active smoker. All participants give written consent before the investigation begins. The research protocol was submitted to the Health Research Ethics Commission (KEPK) of The General Hospital of Education Prof. Dr. RD. Kandou (Manado, Republic of Indonesia) online at http://sim_epk.keppkn.kemkes.go.id. All protocols referred to The Declaration of Helsinki and The Council for International Organiz tions of Medical Sciences (CIOMS). Measurement of Efficacy Results A total of 70 participants who met the research criteria were asked to visit the clinic once every 1 week (0th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th/last week of the study period) with a total of 5 clinical visits including initial examination. During each visit, the use of the supplement is currently reviewed and symptoms or side effects are noted. During screening visits, demographic and lifestyle information is collected (age, alcohol consumption, and smoking habits). Medical history is taken and urine turbidity tests are carried out. The following parameters are assessed; Weight, Height, WHR and BMI during each visit. Blood samples were collected after a minimum of 12 hours of fasting during initial screening as well as in the 0, 2nd and 4th weeks of the intervention period to obtain blood glucose profiles, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high_density lipoprotein (HDL), low_density lipoprotein (LDL) and PGC_1_. Blood samples were taken from the arm vein. The arm vein to be punctured is cleaned with 70% alcohol and allowed to dry. A tourniquet is placed on the upper arm to expose and slightly accentuate the veins. The skin is stretched over the vein with the fingers of the left hand so that the vein cannot move. The skin is pierced with a needle and syringe with the right hand until the tip of the needle enters the lumen of the vein. The tourniquet is removed and slowly withdraw the syringe suction until the desired amount of blood is obtained. A 70% alcohol swab is placed over the needle and the syringe and needle are removed. The needle is removed from the syringe and the blood sample is transferred into a vacutainer tube. Evaluation of Safety and Diet The safety of the extract is assessed by the following procedure. Urine Test Strips 10 Verify Parameters, Parameters examined are: _ Glucose (50 _100 mg / dl) _ Protein (7.5 _ 15 mg / dl) _ pH (5_9) _ Leukocytes (9_15 leu / ul) _ Nitrite (0.05_0.1 mg/ dl) _ Urobilinogen (0.2_1.0 mg / dl) _ Blood (5_10 Ery/ul) _ Ketones (2.5_5 mg/dl) _ Bilirubin (0.4_1.0 mg/ dl) _ Specific Gravity (SG) (1,000_1,030) Test the urine parameters above using Urinalysis 10U Reagent Strips Verify (REF U031_102 exp. 2022_03_05). Pulse rate and blood pressure are measured on each visit after a 5_minute break using intelliVue MP70 (Philips, Netherlands). Personal reports are also recorded at these times. We kept the subjects maintaining their usual diet and activity, and all participants completed diet records on each visit to the clinic during the intervention period to evaluate their energy intake and diet quality. Food intake data were analyzed by a nutritionist (Melvin Junior Tanner, S.Gz). Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis is performed using SPSS software, version 26 (IBM Corporation). Fixed effects include treatment groups, treatment visits, and interactions between treatment and visit groups. The value p<0.05 is considered statistically significant."

To conduct a pilot randomized trial of a remote, perioperative telemonitoring intervention to improve patient_centered outcomes, surgical outcomes, and healthcare resource use in English and Spanish_speaking patients scheduled to undergo major abdominal gastrointestinal (GI) cancer surgery. Ia. Assess the feasibility, retention, and acceptability of the remote perioperative telemonitoring intervention as measured by the percentage of patients who a) agree to participate; b) complete >= 70% of the telemonitoring; and c) report satisfaction with the intervention through structured exit interviews. Ib. Determine the preliminary efficacy of the remote perioperative telemonitoring intervention on surgical outcomes, healthcare utilization, patient_reported outcomes (PROs), and functional recovery. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I (TELEMONITORING): Patients wear a Vivofit 4 daily for 30 days after hospital discharge for steps monitoring, and complete questionnaires over 5_7 minutes about symptoms and quality of life using the Aetonixx application (app) up to 7 days before surgery, before being discharged from the hospital after surgery, and on days 2, 7, 14, 30 after discharge. Patients also complete pulse oximetry, temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and weight assessment using at_home monitoring devices before surgery, then on days 2, 7, 14, 30 after discharge. Patients assessments are monitored by the surgical team in real_time to identify outcome trends, including onset, worsening/improving measures, and sporadic versus consistent measures. ARM II (ENHANCED USUAL CARE): Patients wear a Vivofit 4 for daily steps monitoring, and complete questionnaires over 5_7 minutes about symptoms and quality of life using the Aetonixx app up to 7 days before surgery, before being discharged from the hospital after surgery, and on days 2, 7, 14, 30 after discharge. Patients also complete pulse oximetry, temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and weight assessment using at_home monitoring devices before surgery, then on days 2, 7, 14, 30 after discharge. Patients use standard procedures for reporting problems."
Nct	Inverse Ratio Ventilation in Neonatal Open Repair of Tracheoesophageal Fistula	2021		CN-02353656	"INTRODUCTION: Maintaining adequate oxygenation after lung retraction and one lung ventilation (OLV) in open thoracotomy during neonatal repair of esophageal atresia/ tracheoesophageal fistula is extremely difficult and usually required stopping the procedure and reinflation of the retracted lung which prolong the surgery time, stopping the procedure during critical situations and endanger the fragile neonate from hypoxemia. Inverse ratio ventilation has been used originally for long time in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to improve the oxygenation and lung function. The mechanism with inverse ratio ventilation is to prolong the inspiratory time with reducing the airway pressure and elevate the mean airway pressure preventing the alveoli from collapse. Also inverse ratio ventilation (IRV) used in many studies in adults during OLV with better oxygenation and lung mechanics. Despite the standard ventilatory sitting in neonatal anesthesia is to adjust the inspiratory time to achieve inspiratory to expiratory (I:E) ratio of 1:2 to 1:3, but inverse I:E ratio (with inspiratory time longer than expiratory time) up to 4:1 in neonatal mechanical ventilation has been shown to be effective in improving oxygenation, PaO2, and gas distribution in atelectatic lungs. Inverse I:E ratio in neonatal mechanical ventilation should be used in caution and for a short period of time to avoid possible complications as air trapping/auto PEEP, volutrauma, air leaks, decrease venous return, and increase pulmonary vascular resistance. AIM/ OBJECTIVES: 1. To compare the incidence of desaturation episodes that needs to stop the procedure and reinflation of the lung using inverse ratio ventilation versus conventional ratio ventilation during one lung ventilation in neonatal open repair of esophageal atresia/tracheoesophageal fistula. 2. To determine the effect of inverse ratio ventilation on hemodynamic parameters, incidence of complications, and length of surgical procedure as compared to conventional ratio ventilation. METHODOLOGY: The study will be conducted at Ain Shams University Hospitals after ethical committee approval and obtaining an informed written consent from patients' parents or legal guardian. _ Type of Study Prospective randomized controlled clinical trial. _ Study Setting Pediatric surgery operating theatre in Ain shams university hospital, Cairo, Egypt. _ Study Period The study will be started immediately after ethical committee approval starting from October 2021 aiming to be completed within 6 months. _ Study Population _ Inclusion Criteria: The patients will be of ASA physical status II_III, neonates aged less than 28 days and undergoing open repair of esophageal atresia/ tracheoesophageal fistula with right thoracotomy. All patients' will be full term with gestational age ³ 36 weeks and weigh ³ 2.5 kilograms. _ Exclusion Criteria: Significant congenital heart disease including cyanotic heart disease, single ventricle pathology, large intracardiac defect with significant left to right shunt, and severe pulmonary hypertension more than 50 mmHg. Other exclusion criteria included prematurity, pneumonia or severe chest infection prior to the surgery, and parent or guardian refusal. _ Sampling Method Based on inspiratory to expiratory (I:E) ratio used in positive pressure ventilation, patients will be randomly and evenly assigned to one of two groups (20 patients each) using a computer_generated list: experimental group IRV (inverse ratio ventilation) and control group CRV (conventional ratio ventilation). Group IRV: the I:E ratio in this group will be 2:1 with the maximum inspiratory time (Ti) of 1.3 seconds. Group CRV: the I:E ratio in this group will be 1:2 with the minimum inspiratory time (Ti) of 0.4 seconds. _ Sample Size Sample size was calculated using PASS 11.0 and based on a study carried out by Son et al., 2020. Group sample size of 20 patients in Group one and 20 patients in Group two achieve 82% power to detect a difference between the group proportions of 0.4000. Th proportion in group one (the treatment group) is assumed to be 0.1000 under null hypothesis and 0.5000 under the alternative hypothesis. The proportion in group two (the control group) is 0.1000. The test statistic used is the two_sided Z test with pooled variance. The significance level of the test was targeted at 0.0500. The significance level actually achieved by this design is 0.0361. The sample size was inflated by 10% to account for attrition problem in prospective studies. _ Ethical Considerations After acquiring local medical ethics committee approval and informed written consent from the parent or guardian, The investigators will enroll 40 patients in this study. _ Study Tools AND/ OR Study Procedures AND/OR Study Interventions All included patients will be admitted to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and kept Nil Per Os (NPO) after establishing the diagnosis of esophageal atresia/tracheoesophageal fistula, had a secured venous access and received dextrose containing intravenous fluid according to the orders given by the neonatologist. An umbilical artery catheter will be inserted by the neonatologist prior to the surgery, also an orogastric tube (OGT) will be inserted in the proximal esophageal pouch and a low negative pressure suction will be applied to suck any secretions in the esophagus and decrease risk of aspiration. Another intravenous (iv) cannula will be inserted after induction of anesthesia and a femoral 22 gauge (G) arterial line will be inserted in any patient without an umbilical artery catheter. After applying standard monitors (non_invasive blood pressure, 5_lead ECG and 2 pulse oximetry; one pre_ductal and one post_ductal, 2 temperature probes; one oropharyngeal and one axillary), anesthesia induction will be started with inhalational anesthetics sevoflurane 2% in 100% oxygen and increasing gradually till end_tidal sevoflurane reach 4_6% with maintaining spontaneous breathing to avoid gastric distension with positive pressure ventilation (PPV) then tracheal intubation will be facilitated with lidocaine 10% topical spray one puff applied to the glottic opening just before insertion of 3 or 3.5 mm non_cuffed endotracheal tube (ETT), then ETT will be fixed just above the tracheal carina (confirmed by auscultation _the ETT will be initially pushed endobronchial then gradually withdrawn till bilateral breath sound heard_ and absence of gastric distension with gentle positive pressure ventilation). After ensure the correct position of ETT just above the carina and below the tracheoesophageal fistula and the patient hemodynamically stable, positive pressure ventilation will be started after establishing muscle relaxation with atracurium 0.5 mg/kg. Anesthesia will be maintained with sevoflurane 1_2% in oxygen/air mixture and fentanyl infusion of 1_2 mcg/kg/h. Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) will be maintained to the lower limit to keep oxygen saturation (SpO2) ³ 92% with minimum FiO2 of 0.3. IV fluids will be maintained as preoperative rate with boluses of normal saline will be given to replace blood loss and third space loss. Blood transfusion will be given in cases lost more than 10% of their total blood volume. All patient will be mechanically ventilated with synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation_pressure controlled ventilation (SIMV_PCV) mode with the following parameters; peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) 10_15 cmH2O above positive end_expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O to achieve expired tidal volume (VTE) from 7_10 ml/kg, Respiratory rate (RR) ranging from 30 to 50 breath/minute to achieve end_tidal CO2 (EtCO2) from 30 mmHg up to 50 mmHg, and pressure support (PS) 12 cmH2O. The same pediatric surgery team will perform all procedures. After positioning of the patient in the right lateral position, the right hemithorax will be opened then the right lung will be retracted to expose and ligate the fistula then end to end esophageal anastomosis will be performed. The right lung will be re_inflated under direct vision to ensure full lung ex ansion after finishing of esophageal anastomosis then the right hemithorax will be closed with chest tube in situ. Patients in IRV group will resumed conventional I:E ratio ventilation after resuming two lungs ventilation. Hemodynamic variables including heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and oxygen saturation (SpO2) will be recorded: baseline (before induction of anesthesia), before initiation of PPV, after the initiation of PPV, after initiation of OLV and every 10 min until the end of the procedure. The incidence of hypotension (as the lower limit of normal mean BP on the day of birth, in mmHg, is approximately equal to the gestational age in weeks, so hypotension considered if MAP is less than the gestational age in weeks); and bradycardia (defined as: HR< 90 beats/min, as the lower limit of normal HR in sleeping neonate is 90 beats/min) or hypoxemia (oxygen saturation less than 90%) will be recorded. In cases of hypotension, the patient will be treated initially with an IV fluid bolus of 10_20 ml/kg normal saline over 5_10 minutes. In case of estimated blood loss exceeded 10% of TBV, transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) of 10_15 ml ml/kg over 10_20 minutes will be given. If the hypotension persisted despite of volume loading, dopamine IV infusion will be used in dose range 5_10 mcg/kg/min until the blood pressure normalize. Bradycardia will be treated initially with stopping the surgery and manual reinflation of right lung if associated with hypoxia and if persisted or not related to hypoxia will be treated with intravenous atropine 0.02 mg/kg. In the case of a drop in oxygen saturation of less than 90%, the FiO2 and the PEEP will be increased to 1 and 7 cmH2O respectively, and if desaturation persist, the surgery will be stopped with manual reinflation of right lung. The incidence of stopping the procedure for manual reinflation of the lung will be recorded, also the length of the surgical procedure starting from skin incision till skin closure will be recorded. Arterial blood gases (ABG) sample will be done two times during the procedure; first one after established positive pressure ventilation by 10 minutes and before the surgical incision, the second sample will be done after established OLV by 10 minutes but not during desaturation episode. SaO2, PO2 and PCO2, will be recorded. After completion of the procedure, patients will be transferred to the NICU intubated, ventilated and sedated. In the NICU chest X_ray will be performed immediately after patient arrival to exclude pneumothorax. The incidence of complications including desaturation episodes that needs only increase FiO2 and/or PEEP, desaturation episodes that needs stop the procedure with lung reinflation, hypotension, bradycardia, hypercapnia, needs for vasopressor and blood loss exceeding 10% from TBV will be recorded. Intraoperative and postoperative data will be collected by the an anesthesia resident not participating in the study. _ Statistical Analysis Numerical data are presented as the mean (standard deviation) or median (range) while categorical data are presented as the number of cases (percentage). Between_group comparisons of numerical variables will be performed by the independent sample T_test, or Mann_Whitney test as appropriate, while those of categorical variables will be performed by the Chi_square test. For all tests, a P (probability) value < 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. _ Statistical Package The data collected will be analyzed with statistical program SPSS (version 22.0 Chicago, Illinois, USA)."

Nct	Supplemental Perioperative Intravenous Crystalloids for Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting in Children Undergoing Oncological Surgery	2022		CN-02508586	"The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that intraoperative supplemental intravenous crystalloid fluid administration will reduce the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting in paediatric patients undergoing oncological surgical procedures under general anaesthesia. Outcomes: Primary outcomes: We will analyse the risk of PONV occurring at different postoperative time points postoperatively (i.e., early, late). The early postoperative period will be defined as the period within six hours after surgery, while the late postoperative period will be defined as the time nearest to 24 hours after surgery. PON was defined as an unpleasant sensation associated with the urge to vomit. POV was defined as an attempted expulsion of gastric contents (vomiting or retching). PONV was defined as any nausea, vomiting, or both. Secondary outcomes: 1. Risk of requiring antiemetic rescue medication during the postoperative period. Antiemetic rescue medication was defined as any additional intervention provided for the treatment of established PON, POV, or PON. 2. Risk of suffering a serious adverse event (any of: admission to high_dependency unit, postoperative cardiac or respiratory complication, or death). 3. To comprehensively determine the predictors of PONV as the dependant variable with age, gender, weight, operative time, treatment group, pain, fever, and preoperative chemotherapy as independent variables. Patients and methods This double_blind, prospective randomized controlled trial will be conducted in Borg Al_Arab Children's Cancer Centre, Alexandria University Hospitals in Borg Al_Arab, Alexandria, Egypt. After obtaining ethical committee approval and informed consent, we will study 100 patients, aged 3_13 years, with a diagnosis of malignancy, undergoing surgery. Parents will be given the option to give their children clear fluids up to 4 hours prior their arrival to the operating room. Screened participants will be excluded if: 1. They personally had a history of PONV or motion sickness; 2. A sibling or parent or both, had a history of PONV. 3. They received antiemetic medication in the 24 hours preceding surgery. 4. Their BMI exceeded 30 kg/m2. 5. They had a history of cardiovascular or renal disease. 6. Developmental delay or mental retardation, or both. 7. They significant intraoperative blood loss (> 30% blood volume loss). 8. They had a history of cardiorespiratory disease. 9. They had a history of renal or hepatic diseases. Patients will be prospectively and randomly assigned to one of the four groups (25 in each group). Random sequence generation and allocation concealment will be done using Computer_generated randomization. Supplemental crystalloid administration started after induction of anaesthesia (intraoperatively), in addition to standard fluid management. Patients will be divided into 4 groups: 1. Group A: intraoperative infusion of 15 mL/kg/hour Ringer's lactate. 2. Group B: intraoperative infusion of 10 mL/kg/hour Ringer's lactate. 3. Group C: intraoperative infusion of 6 mL/kg/hour Ringer's lactate. 4. Group D: standard fluid management alone. Perioperative management: All children will be given midazolam at 0.5 mg/kg orally for sedation 30 min in preoperative holding area. Anaesthesia will induced with sevoflurane in oxygen. After induction a peripheral IV cannula will be inserted for intravenous access; none of the patients will receive any prophylactic antiemetic drugs. Anaesthesia will be maintained with endotracheal tube (ETT), and controlled ventilation using atracurium, sevoflurane, and oxygen. Anaesthesia will be supplemented with fentanyl 1 µg/kg during induction and a suitable regional analgesia technique for surgery. Monitoring will include electrocardiogram, blood pressure, endtidal CO2, temperature and pulse oximetry. The ETT Will be removed at the conclusion of surgery under a deep plane of anaesthesia. Postoperative care will be standardized. Rescue antiemetics will be administered to patients if they were severely nauseated or vomited on more than one occasion using ondansetron 1_2 mg i.v., analgesia will be given to children complaining of pain using a pain scale monitoring for toddlers and young children. This will be consisted of oral analgesia (paracetamol). Perioperatively, the study investigators and postanesthesia care unit (PACU) nurses will be blinded to the allocation of the groups and the amount of fluid the subjects received."
Nct	Randomized Controlled Trial of Digital Twin Precision Treatment: a Novel Whole Body Digital Twin Enabled Precision Treatment for Type 2 Diabetes	2022		CN-02358184	"This is a randomized study comparing outcomes of usual care patients diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) with patients diagnosed with T2D enrolled onto Twin Health's TPT system. Twin Precision Treatment (TPT) system utilizes live, exercise and nutrition coaching based on computer algorithm learning to attempt to improve patients overall health and reverse type 2 diabetes (T2D). The TPT system does so by measuring and addressing glucose aberrations associated with meals. Using Whole Body Digital Twin (WBDT) platform powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, the Whole Body Digital Twin platform captures data on up to 174 health markers, up to 3000 daily data points to provide precision nutrition guidance to the patient that precisely balances 87 essential nutrient factors. The platform captures daily weight using Bluetooth scales and captures daily blood pressure, particularly in patients with underlying HTN using Bluetooth blood pressure measurement. Additionally, the Whole Body Digital Twin platform captures daily physical activity and sleep data, and provides precision guidance on activity and sleep for the patient to follow. The machine learning algorithm is devised to integrate these multi_dimensional data and accurately predict personalized glucose responses. Dietary intake is a central determinant of blood glucose levels, and thus, to achieve optimal glucose levels, it is imperative to make food choices that induce normal postprandial glycemic responses. Thus, the platform will suggest the right food to the right participant at the right time. Depending on the likes and dislikes of the patient, the Whole Body Digital Twin platform will recommend a meal plan that is balanced across macro, micro and biota nutrients to reduce glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity, which helps in ameliorating inflammation, fatty liver and insulin resistance. This precise management of nutrition, activity and sleep ensures that the average blood glucose of the day will be consistently maintained within the optimal range. The intervention will continuously offer precision nutrition, precision sleep and precision activity recommendations. Nutritional, activity, and sleep counseling will be provided by trained health coaches through the app and via telephone. In the usual care of type 2 diabetes, glucose_lowering medications are added progressively with lifestyle modification to improve glycemia and optimize glycated hemoglobin values (HbA1c) so as to reduce the risk of developing long_term complications. Standard of care is to take such a glucose_centric approach to T2D management rather than focusing treatment on the underlying root causes of the disease. It is rare to attempt to target remission of the diabetes process since remission occurs in usual care regimens in only a very small percentage of patients with type 2 diabetes (21). Studies that target other metabolic disease states, such as obesity, have been proven to also impact T2D progression and achieve remission states, but these types of approaches are rare in the usual care setting (22). Only three therapeutic approaches have been associated with remission of diabetes: 1. Bariatric surgery, 2. Very Low_Calorie diet, and 3. Ketogenic diet with near elimination of carbohydrate (23). Our study attempts to determine if precision nutritional, activity and sleep guidance associated with the Whole Body Digital Twin (WBDT) platform and Twin Precision Treatment (TPT) can lead to diabetes remission in a population of patients with T2D."
Nct	Polyphenol Supplementation and Morbid Obesity Parameters	2022		CN-02423185	"The main objective of this study is to assess the effect of a polyphenol_rich dietary supplement, along with a hypocaloric diet, on obesity parameters in participants with morbid obesity. Anthropometric, biochemical and inflammatory parameters, as well as different metabolic pathways and microbiota diversity will be assessed. The estimated number of participants to include is 40. They will be patients with morbid obesity, referred to the Endocrinology and Nutrition Unit from Bellvitge University Hospital for a weight loss treatment, in many cases prior to a bariatric surgery. To estimate the sample size the following assumptions were made: same number of participants in each group; 10% variation in anthropometric and laboratory measurements; trial power of 0.85 and alfa error of 5%; estimated losses to follow_up: 15%. The main component of the intervention is a polyphenol_rich dietary supplement administrated for 12 weeks. Lifestyle, dietary, physical activity data and blood and urine samples will be collected in three visits (baseline, week 6 and week 12); faecal samples will be collected in visits baseline and week 12. All participants will follow a hypocaloric diet and will be randomly assigned to either intervention group (IG) or control group (CG) after recruitment, following a simple randomisation procedure. The IG will take the supplement (3 capsules/day), whereas the CG will take a placebo (3 capsules/day). This trial will be carried out following the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki, the Principles of the Good Clinical Practice, under the existing legislation. Data collected will be kept strictly confidential. Any participant will have the right to access, rectification, cancellation and opposition over such data in accordance with the Organic Law 15/1999, Personal Data Protection. All information will be stored in a Data Collection Notebook, from which the database will be created. All participants will be provided with an information sheet and will have to sign a consent form before the beginning of this trial. Any participant will be allowed to abandon the study for any reason: if requested; if the suspension is in the medical interest; if an incidence is presented as a consequence of the intervention, inacceptable or representing a threat to the participants' health; if the participant presents any breakthrough disease or other condition that, according to the principal investigator (PI), are relevant to suspend the intervention. Data on medical history, lifestyle and sociodemographic characteristics will be collected through participants' clinical records and interviews at baseline. The standard hypocaloric diet (1200 kcal) that participants will have to follow for the entire 12 weeks of the study will be explained to each participant on the first visit. On each visit participants will provide a 3_day food record, completed the three days preceding such visits. Qualified staff will collect data on dietary habits through a 24_hours dietary recall and will take anthropometric measurements, including height, weight, hip and waist circumference, body composition using an ergonomic measuring tape and a bioimpedance scan. Dietary and anthropometric assessment will be performed following the standard procedures from the Dietetic and Clinical Nutrition Unit from Bellvitge University Hospital. Programari de Clcul Nutricional Pro 1.0 Software, developed by University of Barcelona, will be used to assess dietary and nutritional intake. It includes a high_quality contrasted database which makes possible to calculate and analyse nutritional intake and body composition. Phenol_Explorer database will be used to assess polyphenol intake. It is the first comprehensive database on polyphenol content in foods which takes into account food processing and cooking and contains more than 35,000 content values for 500 different polyphenols over 400 foods. On each visit qualified staff will collect data on physical activity through a shortened version in Spanish of the Minnesota Leisure Time hysical Activity Questionnaire and will measure blood pressure through a semi_automated oscillometer. Prior to each visit participants will need to fast for 12 hours as they will have blood samples taken. On each visit, 20ml of blood will be extracted from the antecubital vein and will be centrifuged and stored at _80¼C until used. Biochemical analyses will be performed by the Bellvitge University Hospital analysis laboratory. Blood tests will include rutinary hematology and biochemistry, and inflammatory parameters. On each visit participants will have to 24_hour urine samples. Three aliquots (2 ml each) will be stored at _80¼C in the ultra_freezers of the Unit of Nutrition and Cancer, Institut d'Investigaci Biomedica de Bellvitge (IDIBELL) (Barcelona, Spain). One aliquot will be used to measure cortisol in the clinical laboratory of the Bellvitge University Hospital. Another aliquot will be used to perform a metabolomic analysis by the Nutritional Biomarkers and Metabolomics group from the University of Barcelona. About Å 500 metabolites (e.g., polyphenols and microbiota metabolites, organic acids, energetic and protein metabolism compounds) will be quantified using ultra_high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. This will allow us to monitor metabolite alterations derived from the polyphenol_rich supplement and associate these changes with improvements in clinical and biochemical outcome measurements. Participants will bring a faecal sample in the first and third visit. These samples will be analysed in future microbiota studies. They will be kept stored at _80¼C in the ultra_freezers of the Unit of Nutrition and Cancer, IDIBELL. Statistical analysis plan: intention_to_treat and per_protocol analyses will be performed. The main variable to assess is body weight and body composition. Secondary variables include biochemical and inflammatory parameters, urine metabolites and microbiota. Pre and post data, and IG versus CG results will be compared using Student t_test for paired and for independent samples, respectively."
Nct	A Mental Health Intervention for a Community Program Called the PowerObesity	2022		CN-02494111	"Research plan A. Significance A.1 Rationale The obesity epidemic in the north American population is a growing concern amongst the scientific community. Diabetes and cardiovascular disease have been shown to be significantly influenced by obesity. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines obesity as having a body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30 m/kg2, which is determined by a person's height and weight. A recently published systematic analysis of body mass index in 199 countries and territories showed a trending increase in the BMI of individuals in the United States alone from 1980 to 2008, ranking the highest in both male and female BMI ranges for high income countries . The United States also ranked the highest for obesity rates (23.9%) in a study analyzing possible correlations between obesity and active transportation in Europe, North America, and Australia . In addition, a study looking at the overall increasing trend of obesity in America estimated that with the current annual progression of obesity rates in America, that 86.3% of adults will be obese by 2030 . Women of non_Hispanic African descent are 56.7% obese, while Latinas are 44.4% obese . There is a need for affordable health programs that could available to the general population. Another program facing the community in the area of study is mental health problems. According to the World Health Organization, depression is ""the leading cause of disability worldwide"" and ""a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease"" . This accumulating problem leads many towards dysfunction, decreased efficiency, loss in quality health, increased addictive behaviors, and even suicide. Also, studies show that major depression and alcohol dependence were ""associated with heavy cigarette use and poor smoking_treatment outcomes . In their study the investigators demonstrated that programs that improve overall health can also improve mental health , . A facilitated lifestyle_based program like the Complete Health Improvement Program (CHIP) has been shown to help lose weight, lower their risks of heart disease and mental health . Through a balanced approach, program participants are instructed on how to make healthier food choices, incorporate regular physical activity into their daily lives, learn stress management techniques, and stop using tobacco (if applicable). A.2 Can a lifestyle education program work for mental health and obesity? Community education programs that deal with the root causes of the problems are very effective in changing behavior and improving overall health . Some of the root issues with obesity and mental health. The program focuses on improving lifestyle of participants. These are some of the lifestyle interventions that will be used and their effectiveness. Healthy diet Healthy lifestyles involve eating a balanced diet, maintaining a healthy weight, working out regularly, being low to moderately stressed, not smoking, and limiting alcohol consumption. A healthy diet has been proven to lower the risk of heart disease. The Mediterranean Diet, for instance, has been shown to lower heart disease risk by up to 70% compared to dieting alone . In addition, nearly half of the money Americans spend on food is spent at fast_food restaurants, which is double what was spent in 1955 . Fat, sugar, and salt are typically high in restaurant meals, which can contribute to heart disease. found that a healthy diet contains a balance of essential nutrients, calories, carbohydrates, fats, and protein, which reduces the risk of heart disease . Reducing body weight An additional contributor to these diseases is obesity. The effects of obesity on cardiovascular disease and diabetes have been well documented. Obese individuals are at risk for a variety of health issues, including high cholesterol, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and stroke . Coronary heart disease, also known as coronary artery disease, is one of the deadliest health issues associated with obesity. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) repo ts that your arteries can become narrow as a result of fat, cholesterol, and calcium building up and forming plaque in your arteries . Angina, shortness of breath, and arrhythmia are some of the signs and symptoms of coronary heart disease. _ Exercise 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per week can improve cholesterol levels . In the intervention the investigators are proposing, physical activity recommendations serve as guidelines improve overall health. Physical activity rates and obesity rates among Americans emphasize the importance of focusing on fitness and weight management. The American Heart Association reports that only 49.1% of American adults met the recommended physical activity standards . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data show that 24.1% of American adults did not participate in leisure_time physical activity that same year. Compared to 1950, the number of sedentary occupations has increased by 83%, while the number of physically active jobs has decreased by 25% , . _ Control of stress Mental health, obesity and other problems are also associated with stress. A person's heart rate and blood pressure increase when they are faced with a stressful situation . There is also evidence that individuals suffering from anxiety, depression, and anger are more likely to develop heart disease . When examining current American lifestyles, which are characterized by chronic stress, this information can be cause for concern. Therefore, Americans may be at increased risk for multiple health problems. Furthermore, many Americans find it difficult to balance work, finances, family life, and time to practice healthy habits . A.3 Nutrition therapy Dietitians (RDs) and nutritionists (RDNs) provide food and nutrition education as well as medical nutrition therapy . In both short_ and long_term studies and in both group and individual settings, Micronutrient test (MNT) administered by a RD or RDN is associated with significant weight loss both statistically and clinically. Dietitian_led individualized visits provide a control for the study. A.4 Medical Group visits The group visit is not the same as a class or group therapy session and clearly differs from other for_profit models which do not address health disparities directly or mitigate them. These models have been used to conduct group visit programs for a variety of medical conditions in multiple practice settings , . When compared with standard individual medical visits, medical group visits have been shown to be associated with clinically significant improvements in a variety of medical, psychological, and behavioral outcomes , , . Medical group and high_risk populations, such as elderly patients , medical group visits have proven to be highly effective methods for improving access to medical care and monitoring complex chronic diseases. The utilization of emergency departments and outpatient services is decreased in patients treated through medical group visits, their quality_of_life increases, and their satisfaction with their care is higher . A.5 Gaps in evidence in treating depression Depression is usually treated in primary care settings using pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy as mainstays of treatment. Most patients with depression are treated by their primary care provider; approximately 5% to 10% of all patients at primary care clinics receive depression treatment . In almost 90% of cases, clinicians recommend antidepressant medications alone or in conjunction with psychotherapy to their patients who are diagnosed as suffering from depression . Antidepressants are currently the most prescribed class of medication in the U.S. , . Such medications as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and other atypical formulations target the dysregulation of neurotransmitters found in depression . Chronic illnesses, including depression, can be influenced by lifestyle and environmental factors, which are often overlooked. Researchers estimate that up to 80% of chronic iseases, such as heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, are caused by lifestyle choices and environmental factors , . A substantial portion of the variance in susceptibility to chronic diseases can be attributed to lifestyle factors and environmental factors , . Poor nutrition, physical inactivity, poor sleep hygiene, unmanaged stress, social isolation, and substance abuse are some examples , . Lifestyle medicine focuses on modifying these maladaptive lifestyle behaviors. The American College of Lifestyle Medicine defines lifestyle medicine as an evidence_based medical practice that promotes health and well_being through evidence_based therapeutic lifestyle modalities . Positive lifestyle changes can reduce depression in several ways. The Mediterranean diet, which incorporates a higher intake of fruits and vegetables, has been associated with a decreased risk of depression . Studies have shown that moderate exercise of 20 minutes per day, 3 times per week can help reduce depression symptoms . Sleep hygiene interventions have been shown to reduce depression symptoms without pharmacological interventions . Active leisure can contribute to better mental health, especially for those who are unemployed, by increasing their perception of spending their time efficiently and effectively . Evidence_based training can help relieve mood disorders such as anxiety and depression , . Intimate and supportive relationships with family, friends, or significant others have been shown to be beneficial to mental health . Individuals who feel as though their lives have meaning tend to manifest fewer symptoms of depression . A.6 10 hit hypothesis approach to mental health improvement The intervention will focus on identifying risk factors for depression and anxiety and will quantitate the educational component of the intervention delivered by mental health professionals that are currently presenting for 30 min during the Monday session to address the root causes as well as to encourage positive lifestyle changes (e.g. sleep, diet, sun exposure, circadian rhythms, and addictions). The previously published hypothesis . The hypothesis proposed by Nedley and Ramirez identifies triggers, that combined, could cause mental health problems. The 10 groups of triggers are: (1) Genetic, (2) Developmental, (3) Lifestyle, (4) Circadian Rhythm, (5) Addiction, (6) Nutrition, (7) Toxic, (8) Social/Complicated Grief, (9) Medical Condition, and (10) Frontal Lobe. Each of these factors will be dealt with in the lifestyle intervention. B. Innovation The innovating proposal is to use medical group visit to encourage positive lifestyle changes that not only will have an impact on weight control but also on mental health in which the minorities around the institution will benefit. The control group will be a dietitian led program that provides obesity care for the inner_city population. The investigators will measure depression and anxiety as well as try to identify causes of depression and anxiety to encourage people to do the changes proposed. By the help of this Accelerating Excellence in Translational Science (AXIS) grant the investigators will be able to help the Los Angeles County (LAC)_Department of Health Services (DHS) population. This approach if successful could be replicated to improve obesity and mental health care in a sustainable way that could impact many people. C. Approach C.1a Martin Luther King (MLK) POWER obesity group visit Endocrinologist Dr. Theodore Friedman (PI) and colleagues at the Martin Luther King Jr. Multi_Service Ambulatory Care Center (MLK MACC) [the name of the center changed to Martin Luther King Jr. Outpatient Center (MLK OC)] began providing obesity group visits in January 2013. The clinic, named POWER (Preventing Obesity With Eating Right), is open weekly on Monday afternoons for about 2 1/2 hours and patients can attend weekly or monthly. In 2014, the investigators changed the format to have English sessions on the 1st, 2nd and 5th Mondays and Spanish sessions on the 2nd and 4h Mondays. University of California, L s Angeles (UCLA) Clinical and Translational Research Institute (CTSI) provided funding to the Charles R. Drew University (CDU) through a research infrastructure grant, of which CDU is an equal partner. Using the preliminary funding, the investigators were able to obtain CDU Institutional Review Boards (IRB) approval, set up a database to track patients, hire a part_time coordinator, and increase the number of patients who attended clinics in person and via video conferencing. The investigators were able to set up an infrastructure for the proposed study through the pilot funding, allowing us to start recruiting patients for the pragmatic study immediately following funding. Power analysis can also be based on the data collected. Our current POWER group visit at MLK begins with registration, vital signs, and 20 minutes of fitness. In this period, new subjects are informed they are part of an IRB_approved study that collects and anonymizes their data. Participants in the study are consented by the study coordinator (90% have consented). In a 30_minute overview, Dr. Friedman or another expert discusses the differences between diet and long_term lifestyle changes focusing on the complications of uncontrolled obesity and the benefits of weight loss, the importance of a plant_based diet, and physical activity. Each participant is then given a physical activity ""prescription"", both aerobic and strength training, on a prescription pad. Providers from orthopedics, mental health, and dentistry are frequent guest lecturers who discuss how obesity affects their fields. This visit concludes with a lecture by our dietitian using the curriculum. ""Instant Recess"" (which incorporates physical activity breaks into the daily routine to boost health and productivity) is discussed and our dietitian offers a lecture based on the curriculum. During the meeting, individuals are encouraged to ask lots of questions and to discuss their successes and barriers with the physician and with one another. The sessions last about 2 1/2 hours, and surveys indicate that participants are satisfied with the length and duration of the program. Each visit follows a standardized format. There are, however, updates to the slides and a variety of topics are discussed so that patients can get new information at subsequent appointments. On October 8, 2013, the Spanish language television station Univision profiled the obesity group visit program on its front page. The fitness was included in the visit in January 2011 and was highlighted on both the Channel ABC7 evening news and Univision evening news on August 10, 2015. C.1b Pilot study The Power Clinic pilot IRB was approved in October 2013, 651 patients consented for that pilot program. Most of patients had diabetes or prediabetes. Regarding weight lost 30% of them lost at least 8 pounds. 12% lost at least 5% of their weight. Those who came more often showed better results. Most participants were satisfied with their experience and results. Input was taken from the patients, and they wanted the program to continue, the investigators also took many of their comments and improved the program overall. As a result, our preliminary data indicates a solid infrastructure, recruitability, and success. Thus, the investigators are in a good position to implement the mental health proposal as soon as it is funded, the investigators only need a CDU IRB amendment for its approval. C 1.c Mental health component. The mental health component to the intervention will be based on the 10 hit hypothesis. That approach has more than 80 presented abstract in various scientific meetings showing the effectiveness of applying lifestyle interventions , . C.2 Study Design and approach. The investigators will do a randomization of the participants for the 18 months comparing those seeing a dietitian and those that will be learning about the 10_hit hypothesis. The study will randomize 75 participants with a 3:1 block ratio goal. By increasing the number of participants in the intervention group of the novel approach to mental hea th and to decrease the load of the dietitian led group. Participants can't choose which group to belong in order to improve the randomization of the trial. Patients cannot be in both arms of the study. The recruitment method will be the same that was used to get the current Power Obesity group. The investigators will invite patients from obesity group to this sub study. Every patient that wants to participate of this mental health component need to consent. Both arms of the study are evidenced based the investigators will have minimum risk. If a participant does not want to consent, the investigators will provide them with a list of other options for them to benefit. The group visits, 2 and a half days will be in Spanish and 2 and a half group will be in English. Each visit 2 _ hours. For the dietician group of the study the intervention will be offered in English and Spanish. Participants can participate of the program if they want. The investigators will use 12 months of data for the study. Los Angeles county will benefit from both legs of the study of this cost_effective approach. C.3.a Approach of both study arms. The emphasis of the Power Obesity is to promote healthy behaviors: a) decrease refined foods. B) decreased consumption of simple refined carbohydrates c) decrease sugary beverages d) a goal of 150 min of aerobic exercise and 30 minutes of anaerobic exercise. Both groups will be assessed by the: the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) which assessed the amount of exercise the participant does. C 3.b Composite group visit. It will have all the element of the visit. 1) a lecture by an expert, 2) Guided exercise, 3) exercise prescription, delivery of the curriculum outlined by the National Diabetes Prevention Program. The visits will be documented in medical records in a system call ORCHID. The duration is going to be 2 _ hours. The intervention will be offered in Spanish and English. In addition to the usual curriculum the mental health component. The mental health presentation will cover various areas from defining depression and anxiety, to what contributes to it, to who is at risk for these disorders and if recovery is possible. The investigators will have share for 20 minutes an evidenced based mental health component. Participants will be encouraged to adequately hydration, listen to more music therapy, begin or continue a good exercise program, and develop a more intentional way of thinking by listing things that they are grateful for. It will also deal with signs and symptoms of anxiety and various lifestyle therapies such as deep breathing, light therapy, exercise, and avoiding pessimistic thinking to combat depression and anxiety. Improving brain health through proper nutrition. A whole food, plant_based diet will be encouraged. Intake of omega_3 fatty acids will recommend as well as enough tryptophan and other vitamins and minerals from their foods. The person's thinking process on depression and anxiety. The benefits of cognitive behavioral therapy and correct thinking were presented along with various remedies for distorted thinking patterns. Addictions will be addressed in the program. Various addictions that can lead to depression or anxiety will be dealt with, two of them being alcohol and narcotics. Those with severe alcohol or benzodiazepine addictions will be encouraged to see a health professional. The common characteristics of addictions with the need to overcome addictions. The investigators will also deal with principles of cognitive behavioral therapy strategies, dealing with loneliness and grief, overcoming loss, and enhancing the frontal lobe function. An accountability checklist will be used with each participant to complete daily. The checklist include accounting for water intake, omega_3 fatty acid intake, and proper amount of exercise, etc. The participants bring the checklist to every session to show that the tasks in each category were accomplished. The checklist will be utilized to encourage compliance with the things that were taught . C 3.c Dietitian led visit This will follow the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics guidelines . An individualized plan will be presented to each of the participants. It will last 1 hour each appointment will follow up appointment of 30 minutes. The focus will be in evaluating caloric intake, increase physical activity and other behavior changes with the goal of achieving a 10% weight loss from baseline. C 3.d Inclusion criteria Age 18+, BMI more than 30 kg/m2, that want to lose weight. Currently eligible or currently able to receive care at the LAC_DHS a physician willing to adjust their medications. If patients are taking weight loss medication like orlistat, lorcaserin, and phentermine/topiramate_ER, phenetermine, diethylpropion, phendimetrazine and benzphetamine they could enroll if they stop the medication 2 months or more before joining. If they take a weight loss supplement, they need to stop it 3 months before participating. The investigators exclude pregnant participants due to the difficulty of tracking their weight. Those with bariatric surgery will be able to enroll if the surgery was 1 year before joining. C 3e Recruitment strategy LAC_DHS and its community partners will recruit patients primarily. There are four medical centers and 19 clinics in LAC_DHS, and many of them have patient_centered medical homes (PCMH) and other primary care clinics. Among the community partners is the Southside Coalition of Community Health Centers, which consists of 8 clinics that can refer patients to LAC_DHS for specialty care, including obesity care. In their 15_20_minute visits, primary care providers in LAC_DHS usually do not have time to address lifestyle changes for obese patients and may refer them to a dietitian or obesity program (such as the POWER obesity clinic at MLK OC). With the introduction of eConsults (a DHS_wide platform that allows PCPs to refer patients to specialists for specialized care, including obesity treatment), LAC_DHS has improved communication among providers. Within LAC_DHS, there are about 200,000 obese patients. All primary providers can arrange a remote consultation with specialists through the eConsult portal, where the obesity clinic and study information can be found. The DHS Endocrinology Work Group, in which endocrinologists from all the medical centers meet biweekly to discuss endocrinology issues, is chaired by Dr. Friedman. An excellent way to disseminate information about the obesity group clinics and the study. Moreover, word_of_mouth referrals and advocacy from our patients in the obesity program will also increase. Los Angeles County Department of Health Services provides care to low_income Medicare beneficiaries (Covered CA) as well as patients without insurance. In ORCHID, visits are tracked by a ""visit charge"" that is not charged to patients. A high percentage of Hispanics and African Americans is expected to participate. Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, those with substance abuse histories, as well as individuals with mental illnesses and disabilities may be recruited. Despite their low representation in the general population, the investigators expect to recruit Caucasians. Covariant analyses will be conducted on the major ethnic/racial groups. C.3 Specific Aim 2 study design and approach. The intervention will aim to recruit the 75 participants for the group intervention and 25 participants for the dietitian_led group. With these numbers, our preliminary power analysis suggests there will be a difference in the two groups with an alpha of .05 and 80% power. C 3.a Measures For this intervention. The investigators will add 3 tests, in addition to those tests already given at Power Obesity, to both arms of the study, 9_question Patient Health Questionnaire (PQ_9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD), and the Depression and Anxiety Assessment Test, at 0, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months of intervention. E. Expected outcomes Although it is difficult to predict weight loss, based on our experience so far, the investigators expect approximately 5% of patie ts to lose over 10 pounds and another 10% to lose over 5 pounds during the course of the program. Another 35% should lose between 2_5% of their weight and the remaining 50% should not lose any weight (although their education and lifestyle will likely improve). Improved mental health markers are expected, as well as better International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) scores and the healthy eating index. Recruiting/consenting goals are realistic. Since LAC_DHS will be recruiting from all parts of the region, the recruitment goals are quite attainable. With the assistance of two volunteer students, the investigators recruited 434 patients in 34 months in the past, with Ms. Duran as the study coordinator dedicating 25% of her time to the project. As a study coordinator, she will recruit student interns. In terms of recruiting participants and completing the study, the investigators do not expect to have any difficulties. One of the strengths of our proposal is the diversity of the participants, but one of its limitations may be the lack of Caucasians and middle and upper class participants. In our view, this is only a minor limitation, as most studies under_represent minorities and treatment programs for safety net clinics must be cost_effective and pragmatic. F. Sustainability: Since the resources of LAC_DHS are being used the investigators expect the program to continue improving and even expand once the program finishes. One of our main goals is to published multiple studies in order to inspire others to replicate the model and help many. The investigators plan to do this regardless of the outcomes. G. Future direction Our study will end up answering many of our baseline questions and at the same time it will be creating new questions to be answered in the future. The study has a potential to be expended with bigger samples and other sites. The results of the study will determine which direction the study will go."

Dhonneur"	Tracheal intubation of morbidly obese patients: a randomized trial comparing performance of Macintosh and Airtraq laryngoscopes	2008	10.1093/bja/aem346	CN-00622315	"BACKGROUND: The Airtraq laryngoscope is designed to allow visualization of the glottis without alignment of the oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal axes. We hypothesized that this new airway device would facilitate tracheal intubation of morbidly obese patients. We compared tracheal intubation performance of standard Macintosh laryngoscope with the Airtraq laryngoscope in morbidly obese patients. METHODS: One hundred and six consecutive ASA I_III morbidly obese patients undergoing surgery were randomized to intubation with the Macintosh laryngoscope or the Airtraq laryngoscope. Induction of anaesthesia was standardized. If tracheal intubation failed within 120 s with the Macintosh or Airtraq , laryngoscopes were switched. Success rate, SpO2, duration of tracheal intubation, and quality of airway management were evaluated and compared between the groups. RESULTS: Preoperative characteristics of the patients were similar in both groups. In the Airtraq group, tracheal intubation was successfully carried out in all patients within 120 s. In the Macintosh laryngoscope group, six patients required intubation with the Airtraq laryngoscope. The mean (SD) time taken for tracheal intubation was 24 (16) and 56 (23) s, respectively, with the Airtraq and Macintosh laryngoscopes, (P<0.001). SpO2 was better maintained in the Airtraq group than in the Macintosh laryngoscope group with one and nine patients, respectively, demonstrating drops of SpO2 to 92% or less (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the Airtraq laryngoscope shortened the duration of tracheal intubation and prevented reductions in arterial oxygen saturation in morbidly obese patients."

It is part of the metabolic syndrome, which encompasses arterial hypertension, dyslipoproteinaemia and diabetes. Obesity is viewed as a systemic disease with pathophysiological mechanisms on the molecular level. Dysfunction of the mitochondrion and systemic low-grade inflammation are among the proposed causes for the metabolic changes. In severe cases of obesity, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, a bariatric operation, can achieve the desired weight loss and has been associated with clinical outcome improvement. Hitherto, the influence of patients' body composition on mitochondrial function and concomitant metabolic changes has not been fully understood. This study aims to quantify the patient's body composition before and after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and to correlate these findings with changes in mitochondrial oxygen metabolism, metabolome and immune status., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this prospective monocentric cohort study, patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (n=30) at Jena University Hospital (Germany) will be assessed before surgery and at four time points during a 1-year follow-up. Body composition will be measured by bioimpedance analysis. Non-invasive assessment of mitochondrial oxygen metabolism using protoporphyrin IX-triplet state lifetime technique (PPIX-TSLT) and blood sampling for, among other, metabolomic and immunological analysis, will be performed. The primary outcome is the difference in relative fat mass between the preoperative time point and 6 months postoperatively. Further outcomes comprise longitudinal changes of PPIX-TSLT and metabolic and immunological variables. Outcomes will be assessed using paired t-tests, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and regression analyses., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Friedrich Schiller University Jena (2018-1192-BO). Written informed consent will be obtained from all patients prior to enrolment in the study. The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at appropriate conferences., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: DRKS00015891. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

Dash"	Association between obesity and chronic kidney disease: multivariable Mendelian randomization analysis and observational data from a bariatric surgery cohort	2023	https://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db22-0696		"Obesity is postulated to independently increase chronic kidney disease (CKD), even after adjusting for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hypertension. Dysglycemia below T2D thresholds, frequently seen with obesity, also increases CKD risk. Whether obesity increases CKD independent of dysglycemia and hypertension is unknown and likely influences the optimal weight loss (WL) needed to reduce CKD. T2D remission rates plateaus with 20-25%WL postbariatric surgery (BS) but further WL increases normoglycemia/normotension. We undertook bidirectional inverse variance weighted Mendelian randomization (IVMR) to investigate potential independent causal associations between increased BMI and CKDeGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate, eGFR < 60 ml/min1.73m2) and microalbuminuria (MA). In 5337 BS patients, we assessed whether WL influences >50% decline in eGFR (primary outcome) or CKD hospitalization (secondary outcome) using <20% WL as a comparator. IVWMR suggests increased BMI increases CKDeGFR (beta=0.13, p=1.64x10-4), Odds ratio, OR (95% confidence interval, CI)=1.14(1.07-1.23) and MA (b=0.25, p=2.14 x 10-4,OR(95%CI)=1.29(1.13-1.48). After adjusting for hypertension and fasting glucose, increased BMI did not significantly increase CKDeGFR (b=-0.02, p=0.72), OR(95%CI)=0.98(0.87-1.1) or MA (b=0.19, p=0.08, OR (95%CI)=1.21 (0.98, 1.51). Post-BS WL significantly reduced the primary outcome with 30-<40%WL (Hazard ratio HR=0.53, 95%CI=0.32-0.87), but not 20-<30%WL (HR=0.72, 95%CI=0.44-1.2) and >=40%WL (HR=0.73, 95%CI=0.41-1.30). For CKD hospitalization, progressive reduction was seen with increased WL which was significant for 30-<40%WL (HR=0.37, 95%CI=0.17-0.82) and >=40%WL (HR=0.24, 95%CI=0.07-0.89), but not 20-30%WL (HR=0.60, 95%CI=0.29-1.23). The data suggests obesity is likely not an independent cause of CKD. WL thresholds previously associated with normotension and normoglycemia, likely causal mediators, may reduce CKD post-BS.Copyright © 2023 by the American Diabetes Association."

Methods: Ten RYGB subjects were studied on three occasions, in randomised order, receiving 200_ml preloads of either water, fat (30 ml olive oil) or whey protein (55 g), 30 min before a mixed meal. PE, CAT, BSL, plasma 3_O_methyl_D_glucopyranose (3_OMG), insulin, glucose_dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), glucagon_like peptide 1 (GLP_1) and glucagon, blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and GI symptoms were assessed over 270 min. Results: Although fat and protein preloads did not alter PE of either solids or liquids, the CAT of solids, but not liquids, was longer than that after the water preload (fat 68 ± 5 min and protein 71 ± 6 min vs. water 46 ± 5 min; P = 0.02). BSL elevated promptly after the meal on all days (P < 0.001), but after protein, the magnitude and integrated increases in the first 75 min were less than fat and water preloads (area under the curve (AUC(0Ð75 min)), 18.7 ± 18.2 vs. 107.2 ± 30.4 and 76.1 ± 19.3 mmol/L/min; P < 0.05). Compared to water preload, the protein and fat preloads were associated with greater increases in plasma insulin, GLP_1 and glucagon concentrations, a reduction in BP, and greater increases in HR, fullness, bloating and nausea. Plasma 3_OMG levels were lower after the protein than after the water and fat preloads (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Given its effects to attenuate post_prandial glycaemia, reduce intestinal glucose absorption and potentiate the Òincretin responseÓ, without inducing more adverse post_prandial GI symptom, protein preload may prove clinically useful in RYGB patients and warrant further evaluation, particularly in those with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and/or dumping syndrome."

However, few studies have reported on the long-term outcome (>5 yrs) of bariatric surgery., METHODS: Between 2002 and 2007, 250 patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 to 60 kg/m were randomly assigned to undergo laparoscopic gastric bypass or laparoscopic gastric banding. After exclusions, 111 patients underwent gastric bypass and 86 patients underwent gastric banding. Factors predictive of improved weight loss were analyzed using multiple logistic regressions., RESULTS: At baseline, the mean age was 43 +/- 10 years and the mean BMI was 46.5 +/- 5.6 kg/m. At 10-year follow-up, the mean total body weight loss for the entire cohort was -37.5 +/- 19.4 kg, -42.4 +/- 19.6 kg for gastric bypass versus -27.4 +/- 14.5 kg for gastric banding. Late reoperation was significantly higher after gastric banding compared with the gastric bypass group (31.4% vs. 8.1%, respectively, P < 0.01). For the entire cohort, improvement or remission of diabetes occurred in 68%; 61% for hypertension; and 57% for dyslipidemia. The long-term mortality for the entire cohort was 1.0% at a mean follow-up of 9.5 +/- 0.4 years. Factors predictive of improved weight loss included the type of operation (ie, gastric bypass), female sex, and the absence of diabetes at baseline. At long-term follow-up, quality of life continues to be improved from baseline for both the groups., CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment for severe obesity with durable 10-year weight loss and improvement in comorbidities and quality of life. Compared with gastric banding, gastric bypass was associated with better long-term weight loss, lower rate of late reoperation, and improved remission of comorbidities."
"T. Nguyen, T. Alzahrani and J. Krepp"	Association of bariatric surgery with major adverse cardiovascular outcomes: Insights from the national inpatient sample 2012-2016	2020			"Background: Approximately one in every three people in the United States has obesity. There is a strong association between obesity and an increased rate of cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related mortality. Bariatric surgery (BS) refers to a variety of procedures performed to achieve a reduction of excess weight. Many small randomized controlled trials and observational studies have demonstrated the association between BS and reduction in major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) among patients with obesity and Type 2 diabetes. However, these studies have been limited by small sample sizes, localized database, or inclusion of surgical procedures no longer commonly used. Our study aims to explore the relationship between BS and inpatients MACEs among obese inpatients in the United States, using a large and contemporary national database. Method(s): This is a retrospective study using the National Inpatient Sample between 2012 and 2016. Adult obese patients with BMI >=35 (ICD 9/10 codes V85.35, V85.4x/ Z68.35, Z68.4x) were included (n= 1,700, 943). First, a univariate analysis was performed to study differences in clinical characteristics between obese patients with BS status (identified by ICD9/10 codes V45.86 / Z98.84, respectively) versus obese patients without BS status. A logistic regression model was then constructed to study the association between undergoing BS and having MACEs, including allcause mortality, cardiac arrest, acute heart failure, acute myocardial infarction (MI), and cerebrovascular accident after adjusting for CVD risk factors such as gender, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, prior MI, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, and smoking. Result(s): Among 50, 296 patients with BS (2.96%), the mean age was 53 +/- 12 years; the majority was female (75.32%), Caucasian (71.85%) and from the hospital region of the South (33.73%). 33.92% had diabetes, 53.27% had hypertension, and 29.60% had hyperlipidemia. Multivariable analysis revealed that obese patients with BS status had a 1.6-fold decrease in the rate of MACEs compared to patients without BS (odds ratio, 0.623; 95% CI, 0.598-0.649; P<0.001). Conclusion(s): The study illustrated that among obese patients with BMI >=35, a history of bariatric surgery was associated with a statistically significant lower risk of inpatient MACEs, after adjusting for CVD risk factors."
A. Nicolucci and C. Maffeis	The adolescent with obesity: what perspectives for treatment?	2022	10.1186/s13052-022-01205-w	CN-02383960	"The dramatic increase in overweight and obesity among children and adolescents has become a major public health problem. Obesity in children and young adults is associated with an increased prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors. Obesity during adolescence represents a strong predictor of obesity and higher mortality in adulthood. Due to the serious implications of obesity in adolescents, effective treatments are urgently needed. Lifestyle interventions represent the recommended therapy. Nevertheless, real world data show that the majority of adolescents do not achieve weight loss in the long term, and are reluctant to participate in lifestyle interventions. Pharmacological treatment is recommended if a formal lifestyle modification program fails to limit weight gain or to improve comorbidities. However, until 2020 the European Medicines Agency (EMA) had not approved any pharmacotherapeutic agents for obesity in pediatric patients. On April 2021, EMA has authorized the use of Liraglutide, a glucagon_like peptide (GLP)_1 analog, for the treatment of obesity in adolescents (12Ð17 years). The efficacy and safety of Liraglutide were demonstrated in a randomized, double_blind trial, enrolling 251 adolescents. After 56 weeks, a reduction in BMI of at least 5% was observed in 43.3% of participants in the liraglutide group vs. 18.7% in the placebo group, and a reduction in BMI of at least 10% was observed in 26.1 and 8.1%, respectively. Gastrointestinal events were the events most frequently reported with liraglutide. Bariatric surgery represents another effective treatment for adolescents with severe obesity, with sustained benefits on weight loss and cardiometabolic risk factors. However, long_term safety and effectiveness data in adolescents are still scarce. Risks of bariatric surgery include the need for additional abdominal surgical procedures and specific micronutrient deficiencies. Hopefully, new pharmacological treatments in addition to lifestyle interventions will offer more chances of success."

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of a 7_ or an 11_week low_energy diet (LCD) for achieving preoperative target weight before BS. A total of thirty obese patients (BMI 46.0 (SD 4.4) kg/m2) followed an LCD (Cambridge Weight Plan, 4184 kJ/d (1000 kcal/d)) for 7 or 11 weeks as preparation for BS. Anthropometric measurements including body composition (dual_energy X_ray absorptiometry), blood parameters and blood pressure were assessed at weeks 0, 7 and 11. At week 7, the majority of patients (77 %) had reached their target weight, and this was achieved after 5.4 (SEM 0.3) weeks. Mean weight loss was 9.3 (SEM 0.5) % (P < 0.01) and consisted of 41.6 % fat_free mass (FFM) and 58.4 % fat mass. The weight loss was accompanied by a decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (7.1 (SEM 2.3) and 7.3 (SEM 1.8) mmHg, respectively, all P < 0.01) as well as an improved metabolic profile (8.2 (SEM 1.8) % decrease in fasting glucose (P < 0.01), 28.6 (SEM 6.4) % decrease in fasting insulin (P < 0.01), 23.1 (SEM 2.2) % decrease in LDL (P < 0.01), and 9.7 (SEM 4.7) % decrease in TAG (P < 0.05)). Weight, FFM and fat mass continued to decrease from week 7 to 11 (all P < 0.01), whereas no additional improvements was observed in the metabolic parameters. Severely obese patients can safely achieve preoperative target weight on an LCD within 7 weeks as part of preparation for BS. However, the considerable reduction in FFM in severely obese subjects needs further investigation. Copyright © The Author(s) 2016."

Plasma concentrations of bile acids (BAs) increase after RYGB, and BAs may act as molecular enhancers of GLP_1 secretion through activation of TGR5_receptors. We aimed to evaluate GLP_1 secretion after oral administration of the primary bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and the secondary bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) (which are available for oral use) in RYGB_operated participants. Eleven participants (BMI 29.1 +/_ 1.2, age 37.0 +/_ 3.2 years, time from RYGB 32.3 +/_ 1.1 months, weight loss after RYGB 37.0 +/_ 3.1 kg) were studied in a placebo_controlled, crossover_study. On three different days, participants ingested (1) placebo (water), (2) UDCA 750 mg, (3) CDCA 1250 mg (highest recommended doses). Oral intake of CDCA increased plasma concentrations of GLP_1, C_peptide, glucagon, peptide YY, neurotensin, total bile acids, and fibroblast growth factor 19 significantly compared with placebo (all P < 0.05 for peak and positive incremental area_under_the_curve (piAUC)). All plasma hormone concentrations were unaffected by UDCA. Neither UDCA nor CDCA changed glucose, cholecystokinin or glucose_dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) concentrations. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that the primary bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid is able to enhance secretion of gut hormones when administered orally in RYGB_operated patients_even in the absence of nutrients.

Comparison of two antibiotic prophylaxis regimens in liver transplant recipients: a randomized clinical trial	2010		CN-01059992	"Background: Perioperative bacterial infections remain among the major causes of morbidity in liver transplant recipients but currently, there is no standard antibiotic prophylaxis regimen that is accepted by all centers. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of two different regimens in our center. Patients and method: From November 2008 till November 2009, 180 consecutive liver transplant recipients in Shiraz transplant center, Shiraz, Iran, were randomly assigned to two groups: first group received ceftriaxone and metronidazole and second received ampicillin_sulbactam and ceftizoxime for antibacterial prophylaxis. All patients received fluconazole and trimethoprim_sulfamethoxazole for fungal and Pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis and ganciclovir added to this regimen if blood assays for cytomegalovirus antigenemia was positive for over 20 cells/high power field. Antibiotics were discontinued after 72 hours in all patients except those with bilioenteric anastomosis (continued for 5 days). Attending physician would change this regimen or add other antibiotics according to the clinical and paraclinical (including daily chest x_ray and urine cultures and other cultures as needed) signs and symptoms of bacterial infections in the hospital course. For analyzing the results patients with blood requirement over 4 bags during the operation, those with ages over 55 y/o or less than 2 y/o, established diabetes mellitus, and those who expired due to primary nonfunction or surgical complications excluded from the analysis. Results: 163 patients meet our inclusion criteria. There was no significant difference in age, sex, MELD score, blood product requirements, donor age, donor Inotrope requirement, warm ischemic time, cold ischemic time, minimum blood pressure during the operation and duration of operation, acute rejection episodes, and immunosuppressive regimen. Rate of positive cultures and change of antibiotic type, fever episodes, specific site (wound, urine, respiratory tract, blood, intraabdominal) bacterial infections during the hospital course and mortality was not different between the two groups. Conclusion: There was no difference between these two antibiotic regimens in the prophylaxis of bacterial infections in liver transplantation recipients."

In this study, the effect of midazolam on continuous epidural infusion of bupivacaine was investigated to find a better combination for postoperative analgesia. METHODS: Sixty patients scheduled for gastrectomy were divided into three groups of 20. The following mixtures, in 40 ml, were infused continuously over 12 hr after surgery; 40 ml bupivacaine 0.5% in Group C, bupivacaine 0.5% 38 ml + 10 mg midazolam in Group M10, and bupivacaine 0.5% 36 ml + 20 mg midazolam in Group M20. If necessary, 50 mg indomethacin suppository was administered. Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, analgesia score, and sedation score were monitored for 12 hr after surgery. Amnesia and frequency of the administration of indomethacin suppository were also noted. RESULTS: Blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate showed no differences among the groups. Greater sedation was seen in Groups M10 and M20 compared with Group C during first 120 min (P < 0.05). The number of patients with memory was larger in Group C (18) than in Group M10 (10, P = 0.006) and Group M20 (6, P < 0.001). Better analgesia was obtained in patients receiving midazolam than in Group C (P < 0.05). The frequency of the indomethacin administration was 2.0 +/_ 1.1 (SD) in Group C, which was larger than in Group M10 (1.1 +/_ 0.9, P = 0.035) and Group M20 (1.2 +/_ 0.7, P = 0.039). CONCLUSION: Adding midazolam to a continuous epidural infusion of bupivacaine provides better analgesia, amnesia and sedation than bupivacaine alone without side effects in patients undergoing laparotomy."
K. Niswender	Diabetes and obesity: Therapeutic targeting and risk reduction - a complex interplay	2010	https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-1326.2009.01175.x		"Obesity is a major risk factor for the development of diabetes and predisposes individuals to hypertension and dyslipidaemia. Together these pathologies increase the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), the major cause of morbidity and mortality in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Worsening trends in obesity and T2DM raise a serious conundrum, namely, how to control blood glucose, blood pressure, and lipids when many antidiabetic agents cause weight gain and thereby exacerbate other cardiovascular risk factors associated with T2DM. Further, evidence suggests that some established antihypertensive agents may worsen glucose intolerance. Many patients who are obese, hypertensive, and/or hyperlipidaemic fail to achieve blood pressure, lipid and glycaemic goals, and this failure may in part be explained by physician reluctance to utilize complex combination regimens for fear of off-target effects. Thus, a clear need exists for clinicians to understand the risks and benefits of different pharmacologic, and indeed non-pharmacologic, options in order to maximize treatment outcomes. While intensive lifestyle modification remains an elusive gold standard, newer diabetes targets, including the incretin axis, may offer greater cardiovascular risk reduction than other antidiabetes therapies, although definitive clinical trial data are needed. The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists exenatide and liraglutide and the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors sitagliptin and vildagliptin effectively lower HbA1c; exenatide and liraglutide reduce weight and blood pressure and improve lipid profiles. Sitagliptin and vildagliptin are weight neutral but also appear to improve lipid profiles. Integration of incretin therapies into the therapeutic armamentarium is a promising approach to improving outcomes in T2DM, and perhaps even in reducing complications of T2DM, such as co-morbid hypertension and dyslipidaemia. Additional long-term studies, including CVD end-point studies, will be necessary to determine the appropriate places for incretin-based therapies in treatment algorithms. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."

Our aim was to compare the 1_year effect of Roux_en_Y gastric bypass (RYGB) versus a program of intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) only on nocturnal hypertension and circadian BP rhythm. METHODS: The study participants were part of a 1_year, controlled clinical trial comparing the effect of RYGB or ILI on obesity_related comorbidities. Ninety participants (49 in the RYGB group) successfully completed 24_hour ambulatory BP monitoring at baseline and follow_up and were eligible subsequently for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 71 subjects (79%) had nocturnal hypertension at baseline. The number of subjects with nocturnal hypertension decreased from 42 to 14 in the RYGB group (P ² .001) and from 29 to 27 (P = .791) in the ILI group. Subjects in the RYGB group had a lesser adjusted odds ratio (OR) of nocturnal hypertension at follow_up (OR 0.15; 95% confidence interval, 0.05_0.42; P ² .001); however, after further adjustment for weight loss, there was no additional beneficial effect of RYGB (P = .674). No differences between groups regarding improvement in the night_to_day systolic BP ratio were found after adjustment for 24_hour systolic pressure (P = .107). Both interventions showed a decrease in the proportion of subjects classified as nondippers, namely, 44% (P ² .001) and 28% (P = .002) in the RYGB and ILI groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: Only RYGB was associated with a decrease in the prevalence of nocturnal hypertension. Both interventions showed an improvement in dipper status, although RYGB was more effective."

Research shows that lean, unprocessed red meat can be incorporated into healthy eating patterns to improve cardiometabolic disease (CMD) risk factors. Objective: We assessed the effects of consuming different amounts of lean, unprocessed red meat in a Mediterranean Pattern on CMD risk factors. We hypothesized that consuming a Mediterranean Pattern would improve CMD risk factors and that red meat intake would not influence these improvements. Design: In an investigator_blinded, randomized, crossover, controlled feeding trial, 41 subjects [mean ± SD age: 46 ± 2 y; mean ± SD body mass index (kg/m2): 30.5 ± 0.6] were provided with a Mediterranean Pattern for two 5_wk interventions separated by 4 wk of self_selected eating. The Mediterranean Patterns contained _500 g [typical US intake (Med_Red)] and _200 g [commonly recommended intake in heart_healthy eating patterns (Med_Control)] of lean, unprocessed beef or pork per week. Red meat intake was compensated by poultry and other protein_rich foods. Baseline and postintervention outcomes included fasting blood pressure, serum lipids, lipoproteins, glucose, insulin, and ambulatory blood pressure. The presented results were adjusted for age, sex, and body mass at each time point (P < 0.05).

Low_density lipoprotein decreased with Med_Red but was unchanged with Med_Control [_0.3 ± 0.1 and _0.1 ± 0.1 mmol/L, respectively, intervention _ time = 0.038], whereas high_density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations decreased nondifferentially [_0.1 ± 0.0 mmol/L]. Triglycerides, total cholesterol:HDL, glucose, and insulin did not change with either Med_Red or Med_Control. All blood pressure parameters improved, except during sleep, independent of the red meat intake amount. Conclusions: Adults who are overweight or moderately obese may improve multiple cardiometabolic disease risk factors by adopting a Mediterranean_style eating pattern with or without reductions in red meat intake when red meats are lean and unprocessed. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02573129."

Lavie"	Prevention and Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation via Risk Factor Modification	2021	https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2021.08.042		"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinically significant arrhythmia, and it increases stroke risk. A preventive approach to AF is needed because virtually all treatments such as cardioversion, antiarrhythmic drugs, ablation, and anticoagulation are associated with high cost and carry significant risk. A systematic review was performed to identify effective lifestyle-based strategies for reducing primary and secondary AF. A PubMed search was performed using articles up to March 1, 2021. Search terms included atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, exercise, diet, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension, stress, tobacco smoking, alcohol, Mediterranean diet, sodium, and omega-3 fatty acids. Additional articles were identified from the bibliographies of retrieved articles. The control of hypertension, ideally with a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor, is effective for preventing primary AF and recurrence. Obstructive sleep apnea is a common cause of AF, and treating it effectively reduces AF episodes. Alcohol increases the risk of AF in a dose-dependent manner, and abstinence reduces risk of recurrence. Sedentary behavior and chronic high-intensity endurance exercise are both risk factors for AF; however, moderate physical activity is associated with lower risk of AF. Recently, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists have been associated with reduced risk of AF. Among overweight/obese patients, weight loss of >=10% is associated with reduced AF risk. Lifestyle changes and risk factor modification are highly effective for preventing AF.Copyright © 2021 The Authors"

Weinbroum"	"Effects of intravenous patient-controlled analgesia with buprenorphine and morphine alone and in combination during the first 12 postoperative hours: a randomized, double-blind, four-arm trial in adults undergoing abdominal surgery"	2009	10.1016/j.clinthera.2009.03.018	CN-00704228	"BACKGROUND: Intense pain in the first 12 hours after major abdominal surgery requires the use of large amounts of analgesics, mainly opioids, which may produce undesirable effects. Buprenorphine (BUP) is not typically used intravenously in this setting, particularly in combination with morphine (MO), due to concerns that BUP might inhibit the analgesic effect of MO. OBJECTIVE: This study compared the analgesic effect of BUP and MO separately and in combination for postoperative pain control in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. METHODS: In this double_blind study, adult patients were randomized to receive 1 of 4 regimens for 12 hours: a basal BUP infusion (BUP_i) of 0.4 microg/kg/h + BUP boluses (BUP_b) of 0.15 microg/kg each; a basal MO infusion (MO_i) of 10 microg/kg/h + MO boluses (MO_b) of 5 microg/kg each; a basal BUP_i of 0.4 microg/kg/h + MO_b of 5 microg/kg each; or a basal MO_i of 10 microg/kg/h + BUP_b of 0.15 microg/kg each. Bolus doses were delivered by intravenous patient_controlled anesthesia, with a bolus lockout time of 7 minutes. Diclofenac 75 mg IM q6h was available as rescue pain medication. Every 15 minutes during the first 2 postoperative hours and hourly thereafter, patients used visual analog scales to rate their pain (from 0 = totally free of pain to 10 = unbearable pain), level of sedation (from 1 = totally awake to 10 = heavily sedated), and satisfaction with treatment (from 1 = totally unsatisfied to 10 = fully satisfied). Blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, and arterial blood oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) were monitored, and adverse effects reported by patients or noted by clinicians were recorded at the same times. Study end points included total opioid consumption (infusion + boluses), demand:delivery ratio, and use of rescue medication. RESULTS: One hundred twenty patients (63 men, 57 women; age range, 21_80 years; weight range, 40_120 kg) were included in the study. Seventy_four percent had other mild, treated diseases (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical class 2). Pain visual analog scale ratings were comparably high in all groups during the first 2 postoperative hours. Pain intensity ratings at 3 to 12 hours were significantly lower in those who received BUP_i + BUP_b compared with the other treatment groups (P = 0.018). The drug requirement during the postoperative period decreased significantly in all groups (P = 0.01); however, there was a significant difference between groups in the demand:delivery ratio at 3 to 12 hours (group * psydrug interaction, P = 0.026). The numerically lowest demand:delivery ratio was seen with BUP_i + BUP_b. BUP_i was associated with a significantly lower heart rate compared with the other groups (P = 0.027); there were no drug_related differences in respiration rate, SpO(2), or sedation. Patients' level of satisfaction with treatment was significantly higher in the group that received BUP_i + BUP_b compared with the other 3 groups (P < 0.001). Postoperative nausea and vomiting were mild and occurred at a similar incidence in all groups, as did rescue diclofenac use. CONCLUSIONS: In these patients undergoing abdominal surgery, the BUP_i + BUP_b regimen controlled postoperative pain as well as did MO_i + MO_b or the combinations of BUP and MO. BUP neither inhibited the analgesia provided by MO nor induced undesired sedation or hemodynamic or respiratory effects."

Cognitive dysfunction is common following major surgery and may relate to intra_operative cerebral hypoperfusion. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether internal carotid artery (ICA) blood flow increases when MAP is kept higher than 60_mmHg using noradrenaline. DESIGN: A randomised, cross_over trial. SETTING: Department of Anaesthesia, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark, from December 2017 to April 2018. PATIENTS: Patients with median [IQR] age 71 [63 to 75] years underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (n_=_19), total pancreatic resection (n_=_1) or gastro_entero anastomosis (n_=_2) during combined propofol_remifentanil and thoracic epidural anaesthesia. INTERVENTION: MAP was maintained between 60 to 65, 70 to 75 and 80 to 85_mmHg, in a random order, by noradrenaline infusion at a stable level of anaesthesia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was change in ICA flow at MAP 60 to 65 vs. 80 to 85_mmHg. Secondary outcomes were change in ICA flow at MAP 60 to 65 vs. 70 to 75 and 70 to 75 vs. 80 to 85_mmHg. Duplex ultrasound evaluated ICA flow. RESULTS: A (mean ± SD) increase in MAP from 62_±_1 to 82_±_1_mmHg elevated ICA flow from 196_±_53 to 226_±_61_ml_min (mean difference 31_ml_min; 95% CI 19 to 42; P_<_0.0001). An increase in MAP from 62_±_1 to 72_±_1_mmHg elevated ICA flow to 210_±_52_ml_min (P_=_0.0271) and ICA flow increased further (P_=_0.0165) when MAP was elevated to 82_±_1_mmHg. CONCLUSION: During combined propofol_remifentanil and thoracic epidural anaesthesia, ICA flow increased by approximately 15% when the MAP was elevated from about 60 to 80_mmHg. Treatment of a reduction in MAP brought about by anaesthesia seems to enhance ICA flow. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT03309917."

There is no information on central 24-h BP changes after bariatric surgery (BS)., METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we analyzed changes in 24-h BP 12 months following BS, with intermediate evaluations at 1, 3, and 6 months, in severely obese adults. The primary endpoint was aortic (central) 24-h systolic BP changes. Circadian BP patterns and hypertension resolution were also assessed. As secondary endpoints, we analyze changes in central 24-h diastolic BP as well as in all office and ambulatory peripheral BP parameters. Obese adults scheduled for BS as routine clinical care were recruited. We included 62 patients (39% with hypertension, 77% women, body mass index, 42.6 +/- 5.5 kg/m2). Reduction in body weight was mean (IQR) 30.5% (26.2-34.4) 1 year after BS. Mean (95% CI) change in central 24-h systolic BP was - 3.1 mmHg (- 5.5 to - 0.7), p = 0.01 after adjustment for age, sex, and baseline hypertensive status. BP parameter changes were different between normotensives and hypertensives. Mean (95% CI) change in central 24-h systolic BP was - 5.2 mmHg (- 7.7 to - 2.7), p < 0.001, in normotensives and - 0.5 mmHg (- 5.1 to 4.0), p = 0.818, in hypertensives. There was a remission of hypertension in 48% of patients. Most patients had a reduced dipping pattern, similarly at baseline and 12 months after BS., CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with severe obesity, there was a substantial central 24-h systolic BP decrease 12 months following BS. Importantly, this change was observed in those patients with normal BP at baseline., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03115502."

Intraoperative liver biopsies were taken. The liver, adipose tissue and serum were collected to measure inflammation. Adipocyte cell size was measured. NAFLD severity was correlated to body mass index (BMI), metabolic health and adipose characteristics., RESULTS: There were 216 participants; BMI 45.9 +/- 8.9 kg/m2, age 44.4 +/- 12.1 years, 75.5% female. Overall NAFLD prevalence was 74.1%, with 17.1% having non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and/or steatofibrosis. Odds of NASH/steatofibrosis increased independently with BMI category (odds ratio (OR) 2.28-3.46, all p < 0.05) and metabolic disease (OR 3.79, p = 0.003). These odds markedly increased when both super obesity (BMI > 50) and metabolic disease were present (OR 9.71, p < 0.001). NASH/steatofibrosis prevalence was significantly greater with diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia. Although greater visceral adipocyte hypertrophy was evident in NASH/steatofibrosis, there was no significant association between adipose inflammation and NASH/steatofibrosis., CONCLUSION: NAFLD remains endemic in obesity; however, NASH/steatofibrosis are less common than previously reported. Worsening obesity and metabolic disease increase odds of NAFLD independently, with substantially compounded effect with both. These observations may help with risk stratification in obese populations. We were unable to delineate clear associations between adipose inflammation and NASH/steatofibrosis in this obese population., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian Clinical Trials Registry ( ACTRN12615000875505 )."

Overweight and obesity are known to be associated with many adverse health conditions in the preconception period, during pregnancy and during the labour and postpartum period. There are no current guidelines to suggest which preconception health programs and interventions are of benefit to these women and their infants. It is important to evaluate the available evidence to establish which preconception interventions are of value to this population of women., OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of preconception health programs and interventions for improving pregnancy outcomes in overweight and obese women., SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 December 2014) and reference lists of retrieved studies., SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (including those using a cluster-randomised design), comparing health programs and interventions with routine care in women of reproductive age and a BMI greater then or equal to 25 kg/m(2). Studies published in abstract form only, were not eligible for inclusion. Quasi-randomised trials or randomised trials using a cross-over design were not eligible for inclusion in this review. The intervention in such studies would involve an assessment of preconception health and lead to an individualised preconception program addressing any areas of concern for that particular woman.Preconception interventions could involve any or all of: provision of specific information, screening for and treating obesity-related health problems, customised or general dietary and exercise advice, medical or surgical interventions. Medical interventions may include treatment of pre-existing hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance or sleep apnoea. Surgical interventions may include interventions such as bariatric surgery. The comparator was prespecified to be standard preconception advice or no advice/interventions., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We identified no studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review. The search identified one study (published in four trial reports) which was independently assessed by two review authors and subsequently excluded., MAIN RESULTS: There are no included trials., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found no randomised controlled trials that assessed the effect of preconception health programs and interventions in overweight and obese women with the aim of improving pregnancy outcomes. Until the effectiveness of preconception health programs and interventions can be established, no practice recommendations can be made. Further research is required in this area."

The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of pleth variability index (PVI) for intraoperative goal_directed fluid management in comparison with standard approach, in patients with obesity undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Methods: A total of 60 patients with obesity who underwent elective laparoscopic bariatric surgery were included in this single_blind prospective randomized study. Patients were randomly assigned to the PVI group or control. Patients were monitored for PVI, heart rate, noninvasive mean blood pressure, and perfusion index. In addition, administered fluids, amount of bleeding, and renal function parameters were recorded. Results: The PVI group received higher amounts of crystalloids (3053 ± 275 mL vs. 1703 ± 349 mL, p < 0.001) and colloids (277 ± 208 mL vs. 17 ± 91 mL, p < 0.001) intraoperatively, and it had higher perioperative urine output. In addition, the PVI group had decreases in blood urinary nitrogen (BUN), lactate, and creatinine levels; however, controls had increased BUN, lactate, and creatinine. Conclusions: Findings of this study suggest that PVI may represent a useful noninvasive strategy for intraoperative goal_directed fluid management in patients with obesity undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery."

The aim of this systematic review was to study the peer review literature regarding postoperative nondiabetic comorbid disease resolution or improvement reported from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing LVSG and LRYGB procedures., MATERIAL AND METHODS: RCTs comparing postoperative comorbid disease resolution such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, joint and musculoskeletal conditions, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and menstrual irregularities following LVSG and LRYGB were included for analysis. The studies were selected from PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, Current Contents, and the Cochrane database and reported on at least one comorbidity resolution or improvement. The present work was undertaken according to the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The Jadad method for assessment of methodological quality was applied to the included studies., RESULTS: Six RCTs performed between 2005 and 2015 involving a total of 695 patients (LVSG n = 347, LRYGB n = 348) reported on the resolution or improvement of comorbid disease following LVSG and LRYGB procedures. Both bariatric procedures provide effective and almost comparable results in improving or resolving these comorbidities., CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review of RCTs suggests that both LVSG and LRYGB are effective in resolving or improving preoperative nondiabetic comorbid diseases in obese patients. While results are not conclusive at this time, LRYGB may provide superior results compared to LVSG in mediating the remission and/or improvement in some conditions such as dyslipidemia and arthritis."

This randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients with obesity and MetS undergoing surgical vs nonsurgical treatment compared changes in BMI, and secondarily, telomere length (as a biomarker of life expectancy) and changes in MetS components (insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension)., METHODS: Study design was a single-center, prospective, three-arm RCT. Group 1 patients underwent novel unstapled laparoscopic one anastomosis gastric bypass with an obstructive stapleless pouch and anastomosis (LOAGB-OSPAN); Group 2, stapled laparoscopic mini-gastric bypass-one anastomosis gastric bypass (LMGB-OAGB); and Group 3, nonsurgical weight loss therapy via a hypocaloric diet with energy restriction (HDER). The primary outcome measure was change in BMI; secondary outcome measures included change in leukocyte telomere length and other MetS components., RESULTS: Of 96 participants screened, 60 were randomly allocated to 3 groups: LOAGB-OSPAN group (n = 20), LMGB-OAGB group (n = 20), and HDER group (n = 20). At post-treatment month 12, respective BMI changes: BMI -12.13 (-8.34, -15.93); -16.04 (-11.7, 20.37); -2,76 (-3.84, -9.36) (p < 0.01). The two surgical groups experienced significant change in telomere length: LOAGB-OSPAN 2.02 (1.61, 2.41), p = 0.001; LMGB-OAGB 2.07 (1.72, 2.43), p = 0.001; and HDER 0.28 (0.22, 0.78), p = 0.26. The surgical groups were also more effective in treating MetS components. There were no deaths. Adverse events: LOAGB-OSPAN (n = 2) (Clavien-Dindo grade II); LMGB-OAGB (n = 8) (grade I (n = 6) and grade II (n = 2)., CONCLUSIONS: Compared with hypocaloric diet therapy, both bariatric procedures resulted in greater BMI loss, and secondarily, a significant increase in telomere length, and greater MetS resolution., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT03667469, registered on 11 September 2018."

In the presented article for the first time describes the evaluation of the effectiveness of the proposed to introduce a new type of staplerless gastric bypass compared to the standard stapler method. AIMS: To evaluate the effectiveness of the author's method of laparoscopic gastric bypass for the treatment of metabolic syndrome with obesity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, randomized controlled trial presents the results of surgical treatment of 80 patients with metabolic syndrome. Patients were randomized into two groups of 40 people. In the first group, the author's method of laparoscopic mini_gastric bypass with a band_separated pouch was implemented, and in the second group, the standard laparoscopic mini_gastric bypass with a standard (stapler_separated) gastric pouch was used. Procedures were performed in the period from 2015 to 2016 with an average follow up period of 3 years. The postoperative change of weight loss and the changes of the main manifestations of the metabolic syndrome, as well as the change in the cardiovascular risk index in the comparison groups were assessed. RESULTS: In both groups there were no significant differences by sex and age. In the first group there were 39 women and 1 man, and in the second group 36 women and 4 men aged 36.75±8.6 years and 40.47±11.0 years, respectively (p=0.097). Three years after surgery, all 80 patients were examined using analysis of variance. At the same time, it was revealed that the change in body mass index after operations, which was 14.02±5.05 kg/m2 in the first group, and 12.38±5.7 kg/m2 (p=0.170) in the second group, was found equally good bariatric effect of two compared methods of gastric bypass. The main indicators of blood pressure, as well as laboratory data reflecting the state of carbohydrate and fat metabolism, statistically significantly decreased in both groups to normal values, which suggests a pronounced metabolic effect of both gastric bypass methods. It was established that cardiovascular risk in the first group decreased from 5.4±0.9 to 2.9±0.4 (p<0.001), and in the second group from 5.1±1.1 to 3.1±0.32 (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the use of various types of laparoscopic gastric bypass in the surgical treatment of metabolic syndrome after three years indicate a significant reduction in body weight, normalization of carbohydrate and fat metabolism. In a comparative aspect, the author's and standard gastric bypass techniques equally positively affect the elimination of the main manifestations of the metabolic syndrome, but the proposed author's method has insignificant advantages in terms of weight loss."

Weight loss and lowering body mass index (BMI) have been shown to lower ICP and improve symptoms in IIH; however, weight loss is typically not maintained, meaning IIH symptoms return. The Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Weight Trial (IIH:WT) will assess whether bariatric surgery is an effective long-term treatment for patients with IIH with a BMI over 35 kg/m 2. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends bariatric surgery in people with a BMI over 35 kg/m 2 and a qualifying comorbidity; currently IIH does not qualify as a comorbidity. Methods and analysis: IIH:WT is a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled clinical trial of 64 participants with active IIH and a BMI over 35 kg/m 2. Participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to bariatric surgery or a dietary weight loss programme and followed up for 5 years. The primary outcome measure is ICP at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures include ICP at 24 and 60 months, and IIH symptoms, visual function, papilloedema, headache, quality of life and cost-effectiveness at 12, 24 and 60 months.Copyright © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

Hypertension has long been associated with obesity, and weight loss continues to be a first-line therapy in the treatment of hypertension. Lifestyle modification and pharmacologic therapy, however, often meet with treatment failure. Bariatric surgery continues to be the most successful approach to sustained weight loss. This review focuses on the underlying physiologic mechanisms of obesity-hypertension, and the impact of bariatric surgery on the treatment of hypertension. Current available literature on the physiologic mechanisms of obesity-hypertension, and the major trials, meta-analyses and systematic reviews of the impact of bariatric surgery procedures on hypertension are reviewed. Evidence suggests significant improvement in obesity-hypertension in patients who undergo surgical weight-reduction procedures. Malabsorptive techniques such as the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or surgical resection techniques such as laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy appear to offer superior results in regards to hypertension control over restrictive techniques such as Gastric Banding. Though long-term control of hypertension following surgery remains a concern, available follow-up post-operative data of up to 10 years suggests a sustained, if lessened, effect on hypertension control over time.

"U. Pagotto, D. Vanuzzo, V. Vicennati and R. Pasquali"	Pharmacological therapy of obesity	2008		CN-01755947	"Obesity is reaching epidemic proportions worldwide and it is correlated with various comorbidities, among which the most relevant are diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. Obesity management is a modern challenge because of the rapid evolution of unfavorable lifestyles and unfortunately there are no effective treatments applicable to the large majority of obese/overweight people. The current medical attitude is to treat the complications of obesity (e.g. dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases). However, the potential of treating obesity is enormous, bearing in mind that a volitional weight loss of 10 kg is associated with important risk factor improvement: blood pressure _10 mmHg, total cholesterol _10%, LDL cholesterol _15%, triglycerides _30%, fasting glucose _50%, HDL cholesterol +8%. Drug treatment for obesity is an evolving branch of pharmacology, burdened by severe side effects and consequences of the early drugs, withdrawn from the market, and challenged by the lack of long_term data on the effect of medications on obesity_related morbidity and mortality, first of all cardiovascular diseases. In Europe three antiobesity drugs are currently licensed: sibutramine, orlistat, and rimonabant; important trials with clinical endpoints are ongoing for sibutramine and rimonabant. While waiting for their results, it is convenient to evaluate these drugs for their effects on body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors. Sibutramine is a centrally acting serotonin/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor that mainly increases satiety. At the level of brown adipose tissue, sibutramine can also facilitate energy expenditure by increasing thermogenesis. The long_term studies (five) documented a mean differential weight reduction of 4.45 kg for sibutramine vs placebo. Considering the principal studies, attrition rate was 43%. This drug not only reduces body weight and waist circumference, but it decreases triglycerides and uric acid as well and it increases HDL cholesterol; in diabetics it improves glycated hemoglobin. Sibutramine has conflicting effects on blood pressure: in some studies there was a minimal decrease, in some others a modest increase. In all the studies this drug increased pulse rate. Sibutramine is not recommended in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, or in case of history of cardio_ and cerebrovascular disease. Orlistat is a pancreatic lipase inhibitor that reduces fat absorption by partially blocking the hydrolysis of dietary triglycerides. A recent meta_analysis evaluated 22 studies lasting for at least 12 months, in obese patients with a mean body mass index of 36.7 kg/m2, where orlistat was associated with hypocaloric diet or behavioral interventions: the net average weight loss was 2.89 kg (confidence interval 2.27_3.51 kg). Considering the principal studies, attrition rate ranged from 33 to 57%. Orlistat significantly decreases waist circumference, blood pressure, total and LDL cholesterol, but has no effect on HDL and triglycerides. This drug significantly reduced the incidence of diabetes only in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance. The major adverse effects with orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal (fatty and oily stool, fecal urgency, oily spotting, fecal incontinence) and attenuate over time. Orlistat should be avoided in patients with chronic malabsorption and cholestasis. Rimonabant is a selective antagonist of cannabinoid type 1 receptor. This drug, by inhibiting the overactivation of the endocannabinoid system, produces anorectic stimuli at the central nervous level, but also has effects on the peripheral systems involved in metabolism control, such as liver, adipose tissue, skeletal muscles, endocrine pancreas, and gastrointestinal apparatus, influencing many processes partially unknown. An ample experimental program named RIO (Rimonabant In Obesity) involved about 6600 obese or overweight patients to identify the effects of rimonabant in weight loss and associated cardiometabolic abnormalities, over and eyond a caloric restriction of 600 kcal in the treatment and placebo arms. In the four double_blind RIO trials published (Rio_North America, RIO_Europe, RIO_Lipids, RIO_Diabetes), rimonabant 20 mg significantly (p <0.001) reduced weight by 6.3_6.9 kg in the non_diabetic groups vs placebo (_1.5_1.8 kg), whereas in the diabetic subjects enrolled in RIO_Diabetes, weight loss was 5.3 vs 1.4 kg in the placebo group. Attrition rate at 1 year ranged between 40 and 50%, similar to the studies with sibutramine or orlistat. Similarly to weight loss, also waist circumference was significantly reduced by rimonabant. As for cardiometabolic parameters, rimonabant induced a significant increase in HDL cholesterol and a significant decrease in triglycerides. Even if no significant LDL reduction was achieved, the RIO_Lipids study showed a significant decrease in small dense LDL particles, more atherogenic, in rimonabant_treated subjects. Non_diabetic treated patients improved basal insulin and indirect indexes of insulin resistance, while in the RIO_Diabetes study, the only one including diabetics, glycated hemoglobin improved by 0.7% in the active treatment arm vs placebo. The effects on HDL cholesterol and glycated hemoglobin seem in a large percentage unrelated to weight loss. These effects have been confirmed by another trial, named SERENADE, evaluating the treatment in naive diabetic patients. Rimonabant is not recommended in patients with a history of depressive disorders or suicidal ideation and with uncontrolled psychiatric illness, and is contraindicated in patients with ongoing major depression or ongoing antidepressive treatment. In conclusion, despite an enormous advancement in basic research to understand the pathogenetic mechanisms at the base of obesity, the pharmacological research did not reach the therapeutic opportunities available for other chronic conditions, like hypertension and dyslipidemia. However, the few molecules available for clinical practice (sibutramine, orlistat, rimonabant) have shown, when properly used, to contribute to reduce body weight and undoubtedly improve cardiometabolic risk factors. With this preamble, according to current guidelines and pharmacoeconomic studies, patients who might benefit from antiobesity treatment are those with a body mass index > or =30 or 27_29.9 kg/m2 with major obesity_related comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, and metabolic syndrome."

To evaluate the impact on IGB on weight loss, co-morbidities (CM), reduction of post-operatory complications on bariatric surgery. METHOD(S): We performed a SR on Medline and Cochrane Library among other databases, including articles published until January 2010. We searched ""Gastric Balloon[Mesh]"", ""intragastric balloon"", ""Comparative Study [Publication Type]"", ""Randomized Controlled Trial [Publication Type]"", ""random*"" e ""systematic[sb]"". RESULT(S): We found two SR without meta-analysis (MA), two SR with MA and two randomized controlled clinical trials (RCCT). In MOP the use of IGB does not improve the weight loss compared to diet (Level of Evidence 1b). There are no long term efficacy data available and there might be a weight gain after the IGB is withdrawn. The risk of minor complications (gastric ulcer and abdominal pain) but not of major complications (intestinal obstruction and esophageal laceration) is greater in patients using IGB (LE 1b). For SOP there is insufficient evidence to support that the use of IGB before bariatric surgery reduces the conversion rate from laparoscopic to open surgery or the intra-operatory complication risks (LE 4). There is a lack of evidence on the impact of IGB use on CM such as diabetes, hypertension or sleep apnea for both MOP and SOP. CONCLUSION(S): For MOP there is evidence that the use of IGB does not lead to greater weight loss compared to diet and it increases the risk of minor complications (LE 1b). For SOP there is insufficient evidence of effectiveness and safety to support the use of IB as a previous step before gastric bypass surgery. For both, there is a lack of evidence on the impact of IGB on CM."

Women with PCOS present an adverse reproductive profile, including a high risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes mellitus. Patients with PCOS present not only a higher prevalence of classic cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type-2 diabetes mellitus, but also of nonclassic cardiovascular risk factors, including mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety. Moreover, at the moment, clinical data on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in women with PCOS are controversial. Finally, women with PCOS show an increased risk of endometrial cancer compared to non-PCOS healthy women, particularly during premenopausal period. Currently, we are unable to clarify if the increased PCOS early- and long-term risks are totally due to PCOS per se or mostly due to obesity, in particular visceral obesity, that characterized the majority of PCOS patients. In any case, the main endocrine and gynecological scientific societies agree to consider women with PCOS at increased risk of obstetric, cardiometabolic, oncology, and psychological complications throughout life, and it is recommended that these women be accurately assessed with periodic follow-up.Copyright © 2015 Palomba et al."
E. Panteliou and A. D. Miras	What is the role of bariatric surgery in the management of obesity?	2017	https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13697137.2017.1262638		"Diet, exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy are some of the means of assisting patients to lose weight, with bariatric surgery being the most effective. Over the last two decades, the increased awareness of the systemic benefits of bariatric surgery, as well as the improved safety and the wider use of the laparoscopic approach, has made bariatric surgery flourish. In the United Kingdom, the adjustable gastric band (10%), vertical sleeve gastrectomy (37%) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (45%) are the three most common procedures. Obesity-associated mortality and co-morbidities such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, renal dysfunction and depression improve significantly with bariatric surgery. The mechanisms of weight loss extend beyond restriction and malabsorption and include changes in hunger and satiety, food preferences, and possibly energy expenditure. Despite its safety and efficacy, bariatric surgery is underutilized as less than 1% of adults with obesity receive it. In view of the evolution of obesity into a global threat, access to bariatric surgery should be increased, whilst developing safer and less invasive weight loss treatments.Copyright © 2017 International Menopause Society."

Despite dietary interventions, lifestyle modifications and the availability of several pharmaceutical agents, management of T2DM with obesity is a major challenge to clinicians. Metabolic surgery is emerging as a promising treatment option for the management of T2DM in the obese population in recent years. Several observational studies and a few randomised controlled trials have shown clear benefits of various bariatric procedures in obese individuals in terms of improvement or remission of T2DM and multiple other health benefits such as improvement of hypertension, obstructive sleep apnoea, osteoarthritis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Uncertainties about the long-term implications of metabolic surgery such as relapse of T2DM after initial remission, nutritional and psychosocial complications and the optimal body mass index for different ethnic groups exist. The article discusses the major paradigm shift in recent years in the management of T2DM after the introduction of metabolic surgery.Copyright © The Author(s) 2015."

Metabolic surgery is the most effective method to treat obesity and may further improve associated conditions. Although most research has been directed toward the glycemic effects of weight loss surgery, there has been a growing interest in exploring its potential blood pressure-reducing properties. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses based primarily on observational data have suggested that metabolic surgery may aid in controlling hypertension. Only one randomized controlled trial specifically addressing this concept has been conducted, though supportive of the findings from observational studies. We review contemporary procedures for weight loss and their effects on cardiometabolic risk, particularly hypertension. In addition, we describe potential pathophysiological mechanisms and the effects of metabolic surgery on cardiovascular events and mortality."

We hypothesised that larger doses of neostigmine could result in faster recovery in obese patients administered vecuronium based on total body weight. Methods: Forty_five obese American Society of AnesthesiologistsÕ II patients undergoing elective surgery under general anaesthesia were randomised into 3 groups to receive neostigmine 30, 40 and 50 _g/kg. Following induction, patients were paralysed with vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg based on total body weight. Reversal was achieved with neostigmine based on the patientÕs group, and time to train_of_four (TOF) ratios of 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 measured. The primary outcome variable was time to achieve TOF ratio >0.9. Results: Neostigmine 50 _g/kg achieved faster recovery to TOF 0.7 than neostigmine 30 and 40 _g/kg. There was no significant difference in recovery times to TOF 0.7 in patients receiving either 30 or 40 _g/kg of neostigmine. However, neostigmine 40 _g/kg attained TOF ratio 0.9 faster than 30 _g/kg. We did not note a significant difference between the 40 and 50 _g/kg dose with regard to recovery of TOF to 0.9. Conclusion: Facilitated recovery from neuromuscular blockade to TOF of 0.7 was faster with neostigmine 50 _g/kg compared to 40 or 30 _g/kg. Recovery to TOF ratio of 0.9 was not significantly different with 40 or 50 _g/kg doses although such time was faster as compared to 30 _g/kg dose."

Patients who underwent BS were evaluated 4, 12, 24, and 48 weeks after surgery, whereas patients who received MT were monitored at a hospital every 6 weeks for 1 year. At each visit, weight, waist and hip circumference, and blood pressure were measured, and patients underwent physical examination and laboratory testing. Health-related quality of life (HQOL) was investigated using Euro QOL-5 Dimension, Impact of Weight on Quality of Life questionnaire-Lite and Obesity-related Problems scale., RESULTS: The study included 264 patients from 13 institutions; of these, 64 underwent BS and 200 received MT. Of the patients who underwent BS, 6.3% experienced early complications. Relative weight changes from baseline to 48 weeks were significantly greater in the BS than in the MT group (26.9% vs. 2.1%, P < 0.001), as were the rates of remission of diabetes (47.8% vs. 16.7%, P = 0.014), hypertension (60.0% vs. 26.1%, P < 0.001), and dyslipidemia (63.2% vs. 22.0%, P < 0.001). HQOL was better in the BS than in the MT group at 48 weeks., CONCLUSION: BS was safe and effective in Korean obese patients, with greater weight reduction, remission of comorbidities, and quality of life improvement than MT.

Methods Following approval by the ethics board, we performed a randomized placebo_controlled pilot study with a purified coconut based topical agent (Test drug), Diclofenac ointment (FDAapproved NSAID) and a placebo (Jasmine oil). The inclusion criteria included axial musculo_skeletal pain of greater than 6 weeks duration in adults 18a_75 years of age. Exclusion criteria included history of spinal surgery, prior use of opioids or NSAIDS in the past 7 days, active cancer, gastrointestinal disorders, heart attack, stroke, uncontrolled blood pressure, active skin lesions or use of topical agents in the past one week. One hundred and ninety six (196) participants were enrolled and randomized to the 3 groups usingthe nQuery Advisor version 7.0 software protocol. The primary outcome measure was the reduction in pain across the three groups. Follow up was by telephone contact at weeks 2 and 12, and a clinic visit at week 4. The primary outcome measure was analgesic effects, measured by the change in numerical pain score from baseline, compared using the chi square test or the Krustal wallis rank test. Results One hundred and ninety six participants were enrolled following appropriate consent. Twenty_six did not respond to follow up (14 in the placebo group, 7 in the diclofenac group and 5 in the herbal medication group). The mean age of the participants was 52 years (SD 12.7) with no statistically significant differences between the groups. Median numerical rating score at enrollment was 65 (placebo group), 70 in the diclofenac and herbalmedicine groups, on the scale of 0a_100. There were no statistically significant differences in baseline pain (Kruskal_Wallis P = 0.3243). Median change in pain from baseline to 3 months showed a decrease of 37.5%, 30% and 40% for the Treatment, Diclofenac, and Placebo groups respectively. All 3 groups showed significant decreases in pain scores from baseline to 12 weeks. There was no statistically significant difference between groups on magnitude of pain scores or any change in pain scores, and this was the case in both the asrandomized analysis and the as_treated analyses. Jasmine oil, which was the placebo in this study, has an antispasmodic quality, and is often used over the counter for pain and as an aphrodisiac. This could also have favored the placebo and help to explain why there was no statistically significant difference between the trial agent and the placebo. Conclusions Chronic musculo_skeletal pain is very common in the society and warrants the search for a safe and effective analgesic. This placebo_controlled, randomized pilot study showed that the test drug was similar in effectiveness to topical diclofenac. Essential oils and herbal preparations have been around for decades. Properly prepared, their analgesic effects may be comparable to FDA approved agents."

We evaluated risk factors for advanced fibrosis in biopsy-proven NAFLD in the VHA to identify patients at risk for adverse outcomes. Methods In randomly selected cases from VHA databases (2005-2015), we performed a retrospective case-control study in adults with biopsy-defined NAFLD or normal liver, with biopsy >15 mm, fibrosis staging, and no evidence of non-NAFLD liver disease. Normal controls (n=65) had normal liver function, no imaging evidence of NAFLD, and no evidence of liver disease. The four NAFLD cohorts included: NAFL (n=76), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) without fibrosis (n=68), NAFLD/NASH stage 1-3 fibrosis (n=82), and NAFLD/NASH cirrhosis (n=70). NAFLD with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was separately categorized (n=38). For all patients, we collected: histology at biopsy; comorbidities, labs, medications within 1 year before biopsy; imaging within 1 year before/after biopsy. Controls and consecutive NAFLD groups were compared with descriptive statistics across adjacent ordinal groupings. A multinomial logistic regression was performed including independent variables of age, race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, platelet count, AST/ALT, hypertriglyceridemia, and smoking status. Results Of 2091 patients reviewed, 399 met inclusion for the analyses. Most patients were White males (mean age range 49.5-70.6 years, 63.1-94.7% White, 73.8-100% male across groups). NAFLD patients with any fibrosis were severely obese (mean BMI 35.9-36.8 kg/m2 across groups). Diabetes (67.1-85.7%) and hypertension (85.4-100%) were more common in NAFLD with fibrosis or HCC (p<0.05). Across NAFLD, 15.8-22.9% were enrolled in diet/exercise programs and 0-2.6% had bariatric surgery. Hispanics exhibited higher rates of NASH (20.6%, p<0.01), while Blacks had low NAFLD rates (1.4-11.8%), particularly NAFLD cirrhosis and HCC (1.4-2.6%, p<0.05). Nearly all (95.8%) with cirrhosis had liver imaging (>1) within 1 year of biopsy. Diabetes (OR 11.8, p<0.001) and BMI (OR 1.4, p<0.001) were the most significant predictors of advanced fibrosis. Smoking and Agent Orange exposure had no effect on NAFLD. Conclusion In the VHA, diabetes and severe obesity increased risk for advanced fibrosis in NAFLD. Of these patients, only a small proportion (~20%) were enrolled in diet/exercise programs and even fewer had bariatric surgery (~2%). These results suggest that VHA providers should focus/tailor interventions to improve NAFLD outcomes, particularly in those with diabetes and severe obesity."

Material en methods: Safety and primary effectiveness of the Articulating Circular EndoscopicTM(ACETM) stapler for gastric volume reduction in the treatment of obesity were evaluated. This prospective observational phase 1 study was conducted in two academic hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients with a BMI of 40-45 kg/m2 or 30-39.9 kg/m2 with obesity related comorbidity, aged 18-50 were invited to participate. Primary outcome measure to assess safety was the prevalence of (serious) adverse events. Reduction of excess body weight was assessed for effectiveness of the procedure and was a secondary outcome measure at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Result(s): Seventeen patients (6 male, median age 37 years, IQR 32-48) with a median BMI of 40.2 kg/m2 (IQR 37.6-42.8) were included and underwent an ACE stapling procedure. Comorbidities included hypercholesterolemia (n=4), hypertension (n=4), type II Diabetes (n=2) and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (n=2). In all patients nine or ten plications could be made and median procedure time was 123 (IQR 95- 129) minutes. No serious adverse events occurred. Adverse events were gastric pain (n=7, range 1-3 days), sore throat (n=4, 2-3 days), diarrhea (n=4, 2-15 days), nausea (n=3, 2-4 days), constipation (n=4, 3-14 days), and vomiting (n=3, 1-4 days). All adverse events were mild and resolved with conservative treatment within 15 days after surgery. The median percentage excessweight loss in the first year was 34.9%(IQR17.8-46.6) Conclusion(s): This first human application of the ACE stapler demonstrates that the procedure is technically feasible and safe. One hundred and sixty plications were created in 17 patients without significant problems. Preliminary weight-loss results are promising, but long-term follow-up as well as randomized controlled studies should evaluate whether this procedure is an effective and durable minimally invasive endoscopic treatment for obesity."

Weight loss and control of related risk factors like type2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic syndrome is an important concern in obesity management. Different therapeutic approaches such as lifestyle change, medications, and surgery are introduced for obesity treatment. Despite of gaining partially desirable results, the problem is remained unsolved. Therefore, finding a new approach that can overcome previous limitations is very attractive for both researchers and clinicians. Cell-based therapy using adipose-derived stromal cells seems to be a promising strategy to control obesity and related syndromes. To attain this aim, understanding of different type of adipose tissues, main signaling pathways, and different factors involved in development of adipocyte is essential. Recently, several cell-based methods like stem cell administration, brown adipose tissue transplantation, cell lysates and exosomes have been examined on obese mouse models to manage obesity and related disorders. Successful outcome of such preclinical studies can encourage the cell-based clinical trials in the near future."

Previous intervention trials to help control GWG have had mixed results. We tested the effectiveness of a diet and lifestyle behavioral intervention designed to increase the proportion of participants whose GWG did not exceed 2009 IOM guidelines, and determined whether pregnancy outcomes improved. STUDY DESIGN: Patients with BMI 25-40 were recruited before 16 weeks gestation and randomized to a lifestyle intervention or usual care. Exclusion criteria included multiple gestation, pre-gestational diabetes, prior bariatric surgery, and IVF. The intervention included an individualized dietitian-prescribed calorie-specific DASH-type diet, physical activity, internet-based self-monitoring of diet adherence, and weekly coaching calls, with opportunities for group visits, webinars, and podcasts. Usual care participants were provided websites, electronic newsletters, and non-diet related pregnancy information. Obstetric providers and data collectors were not aware of patient group assignment. RESULT(S): 281 participants were randomized to the intervention or usual care, with complete data available for all but 2 patients. Baseline characteristics of maternal age, parity, gestational age at randomization, race, ethnicity, and pre-pregnancy BMI were similar. There were 4 pregnancy losses after randomization but before 24 weeks (data not included), and 1 fetal death after 24 weeks. The intervention group gained significantly less weight from enrollment to 36 weeks than the usual care group, and fewer participants exceeded the IOM recommendations (table). This did not result in fewer diagnoses of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, or birth weight >4 kg; a higher rate of cesarean birth was observed in the intervention group. CONCLUSION(S): The MOMFIT behaviorally adapted, nutrient-dense, energy-balanced diet and lifestyle intervention resulted in better adherence to IOM guidelines for gestational weight gain, but improvements in pregnancy outcomes were not observed."

The results provide abundant evidence that an ambitious treatment strategy is superior to a conventional one. The study involved 160 high_risk type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria_a strong risk factor of both macrovascular and microvascular complications_aged 55.1 years, who were randomly assigned to a conventional or an intensive, multifactorial intervention for a period of 7.8 years. In the intensive group, a stepwise treatment plan was adopted involving both continuous lifestyle education and motivation and an ambitious goal_oriented pharmacological treatment of known modifiable risk factors. The conventional group was treated in accordance with national guidelines for type 2 diabetes with less stringent goals. The specific significant group differences in the degree of change in key clinical and biochemical variables at the end of the study were (in the intensive group): lower systolic and diastolic blood pressures, hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)), fasting serum total and low_density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, fasting serum triglycerides, and 24_hour urine albumin excretion, as well as increased carbohydrate and decreased fat intake as percentage of total energy. There was no difference in weight gain between groups during follow_up and no other major side effects were reported. The primary end point was a macrovascular outcome: a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous coronary intervention, nonfatal stroke, amputation for ischemia, or vascular surgery for peripheral arterial atherosclerosis. The differences between groups in surrogate end points translated into the following significant group differences in final clinical end points: 44% of patients in the conventional group had a cardiovascular event compared with 24% in the intensive group, ie, a relative risk reduction of about 50%. Also, the relative risk of nephropathy, retinopathy, and autonomic neuropathy (secondary end points) was diminished by about 60% in the intensively treated group. In conclusion, an intensified and goal_oriented multipronged approach to the treatment of type 2 diabetes reduces cardiovascular events, as well as nephropathy, retinopathy, and autonomic neuropathy, by about half. The challenge is to ensure that this experience is widely adopted in daily practice."

Patients usually present with diffuse, daily headache and visual disturbances, but either symptom can occur in isolation. Patients with IIH often have papilloedema; however, IIH without papilloedema is fairly common in patients with chronic daily headache. The pathogenesis of IIH is unknown; the high incidence of comorbid bilateral transverse sinus stenosis (BTSS) in patients with IIH suggests that the two conditions are linked, although no direct causal relationship has been established. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure monitoring or lumbar puncture - which provides immediate symptomatic relief - are important in making a diagnosis of IIH. Current treatments for IIH include weight reduction, medical treatment, CSF diversion surgery, optic nerve sheath fenestration and, potentially, endovascular stenting (in patients with BTSS). Prevention of visual loss (which can be substantial) is the main goal of treatment. Residual headache and IIH recurrence are not uncommon after treatment, and regular follow-up is, therefore, warranted even in patients who achieve remission.

Special focus will be put on recent theories about the pathophysiology, and on newer prospective studies on treatment modalities. Recent findings The Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial (IIHTT) provided evidence supporting acetazolamide as a well tolerated first-line therapy in IIH patients with mild vision loss. Recent studies have shown venous sinus stenting as a well tolerated and effective surgical alternative for patients with refractory IIH. Summary Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a vision-threatening disorder that predominantly affects obese women of childbearing age. This disorder is becoming more prevalent as the obesity epidemic continues to increase. As our understanding of this disorder continues to evolve, diagnosis and management approaches have changed over time. However, the pathogenesis for IIH remains unclear. Several theories have been proposed, including abnormalities in cerebrospinal dynamics, metabolic causes and genetics. The diagnostic criteria are based on the revised Dandy criteria. Traditionally, treatment was based on clinical experiences and retrospective studies. However, a new, prospective, randomized, controlled trial, the IIHTT, provided evidence-based data to help guide medical therapy. Additionally new, prospective studies are underway for the different surgical alternatives to treat IIH.Copyright © 2018 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved."

Methods: A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted in a Mexican High_specialty Hospital in patients with obesity (body mass index [BMI]) ³ 35 kg/m2) and 18_55 years. Subjects were randomized in 2 groups: placebo vs phentermine (15 mg/d). Study drug capsules were masked to look identical for all drugs and doses. The participants were recommended their dietary treatment according to their energy requirements determined by indirect calorimetry. Baseline and final measurements of body weight, body composition, biochemical parameters and blood pressure (BP) were performed and hepatic ultrasound by the same observer. Surgical times, intraoperative bleeding, hospital stay, and surgical complications were monitored. Statistical analysis was performed with t paired and mcNeumanÕs chi. All participants signed the informed consent form. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Hospital. (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03849729) Results: 56 subjects finished, the majority of subjects were female (67.9%), with a mean age of 37.1± 9.41 years. Body weight (_1.90±0.63 kg, p=0.005), BMI (_0.68±0.22 kg/m2, p=0.004), and percentage of fat mass (_0.40±0.21, p=0.05), decreased in phentermine group. Interestingly, hepatic steatosis improved in this group from severe to moderate 50%, from moderate to mild 80% and from mild it was maintained or improved by 12%. In contrast, no such pattern was observed in the placebo group. In addition, side effects were questioned and not significantly observed, only one subject who discontinued the medication slightly increased blood pressure. There were no significant differences in surgical times and complications. Conclusion: Our study shows that a lower dose phentermine improved hepatic steatosis after 60 days of treatment in subjects with obesity, who were candidates for surgical treatment, regardless of weight loss.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of phentermine in reducing hepatic steatosis, adipose tissue, and surgical complications in patients undergoing bariatric surgery., METHODS: This was a two-arm, double-blind, randomized, controlled pilot trial of 64 adult subjects with BMI >35 kg/m2 selected for bariatric surgery randomized into phentermine group (15 mg once daily) or placebo group for 8 weeks. Both groups adhered to a hypocaloric diet (500 calories/day) and an individualized exercise program. The primary endpoint was reducing the frequency of hepatic steatosis measured by ultrasound and reducing adipose tissue through fat mass in total kilograms or percentage. Key secondary points were the prevalence of surgical complications. Baseline and final biochemical parameters and blood pressure too were assessments., RESULTS: In the phentermine group, the frequency of hepatic steatosis decreased by 19%, and the percentage of patients with a normal ultrasound increased from 9% to 28% (p = 0.05). Likewise, the decrease in fat mass in kilograms was more significant in the phentermine group (56.1 kg vs. 51.8 kg, p = 0.02). A significant reduction in the HOMA-IR index was observed regardless of weight loss. No differences in surgical complications were observed between groups. Phentermine was well-tolerated; no differences were observed in the frequency of adverse events between the groups., CONCLUSIONS: Phentermine decreased the proportion of individuals with hepatic steatosis by 19% and promoted a more significant fat mass loss in kilograms among candidates for bariatric surgery.

A hemodynamic protocol including fluid administration and vasoactive drugs based on arterial blood pressure, cardiac index, and stroke volume response was compared with standard practice. Patients were followed until hospital discharge (determined by a surgeon blinded to the study) or death. In contrast to previous studies, we designed a pragmatic trial (as opposed to explanatory trials) to mimic real practice and obtain maximal external validity for the study. RESULTS: Fluid administration was similar except for the number of colloid boluses (2.4 ± 1.8 [treated] vs 1.3 ± 1.4 [control]; P < 0.001) and packed red blood cell units (0.6 ± 1.3 [treated] vs 0.2 ± 0.6 [control]; P = 0.019). Dobutamine was used in 25% (intraoperatively) and 19.4% (postoperatively) of the treated patients versus 1.4% and 0% in the control group (P < 0.001). We have observed a reduction in reoperations in the treated group (5.6% vs 15.7%; P = 0.049). However, no significant differences were observed in overall complications (40% vs 41%; relative risk 0.99 [0.67_1.44]; P = 0.397), length of stay (11.5 [8_15] vs 10.5 [8_16]; P = 0.874), time to first flatus (62 hours [40_76] vs 72 hours [48_96]; P = 0.180), wound infection (7 vs 14; P = 0.085), anastomotic leaks (2 vs 5; P = 0.23), or mortality (4.2% vs 5.7%; P = 0.67). CONCLUSIONS: The results of our pragmatic study indicate that a perioperative hemodynamic protocol guided by a noninvasive cardiac output monitor was not associated with a decrease in the incidence of overall complications or length of stay in major abdominal surgery."

Objective(s): To add more power by merged 5-year study populations with additional retrieved data to compare LSG and LRYGB long-term outcomes. Method(s): Initially 457 patients (LSG 228, LRYGB 229) were randomized to either LSG or LRYGB. Primary outcome was %total weight total loss (%TWL). Secondary outcomes included %excess BMI loss (%EBMIL), co-morbidities, QOL, and complications (Comprehensive Complication Index, Clavien-Dindo complications > II). Result(s): At 5 years, LRYGB was superior compared to LSG both in mean %TWL (LSG 24%, +/-10.75 vs. LRYGB 28%, +/-10.29, p>0.0001) and mean %EBMIL (LSG 56%, +/-25.9 vs. LRYGB 63%, +/-24.2, p=0.0001). No difference was seen in remission rates of diabetes and OSAS or QOL improvement, but remission rates defined by medication use for dyslipidemia and hypertension were superior after LRYGB (p=0.0151 and p=0.0220, respectively). Morbidity (CCI=0 vs. CCI>0) was significantly higher (p=0.0012) after LRYGB, but there was no difference between the procedures in mean total CCI scores (all patients with CCI>0, LSG 31.03 vs. LRYGB 30.6, p=0.8588). Conclusion(s): Long-term weight loss is superior after LRYGB. There is no difference in resolution of T2DM and OSAS, but dyslipidemia and hypertension may improve more after LRYGB. The prevalence of complications is higher after LRYGB, but there is no difference between complication severity between the procedures."

The search was restricted to human studies. Two independent researchers extracted the data. Data were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta Analysis version 2 using random effects analysis. A total of 22 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis and 20 studies (3 randomized controlled trials), involving 1259 participants, were included in the meta-analysis. The standardized mean difference for the overall effect of weight loss on PWV measured at all sites was -0.32 (95% confidence interval, -0.41, -0.24; P=0.0001). Carotid femoral pulse wave velocity (standardized mean difference, -0.35; 95% confidence interval, -0.44, -0.26; P=0.0001; 16 studies) and brachial ankle PWV (standardized mean difference, -0.48; 95% confidence interval, -0.78, -0.18; P=0.002; 5 studies) were improved with weight loss. Meta-regression showed that change in blood pressure was a predictor of change in PWV (P<0.01)., CONCLUSION: Modest weight loss (mean 8% of initial body weight) achieved with diet and lifestyle measures improved PWV. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that weight loss may reduce PWV, although future research is required. Copyright © 2014 American Heart Association, Inc."

MATERIALS/METHODS: We compared 1_year follow_up anthropometric and metabolic profiles in severely obese who underwent BPD_DS (n = 73) with controls (severely obese without surgery) (n =3 3). The 10_year predicted risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) was estimated using the Framingham risk_tool. We assigned 10_year and lifetime predicted risks to stratify subjects into 3 groups: 1) high short_term predicted risk (³ 10% 10_year risk or diagnosed diabetes), 2) low short_term (<10% 10_year risk)/low lifetime predicted risk or 3) low short_term/high lifetime predicted risk. RESULTS: During the follow_up period, body weight and body mass index decreased markedly in the surgical group (_52.1 ± 1.9 kg and _19.0 ± 0.6 kg/m(2) respectively, p<0.001) vs. (_0.7 ± 1.0 kg and _0.3 ± 0.4 kg/m(2), p = 0.51). Weight loss in the surgical group was associated with a reduction in HbA1C (6.2% vs. 5.1%), HOMA_IR (61.5 vs. 9.3), all lipoprotein levels, as well as blood pressure (p<0.001). The 10_year CHD predicted risk decreased by 43% in women and 33% in men, whereas the estimated CHD risk in the non surgical group did not change. Before surgery, none of the women and only 18% of men showed low short_term/low lifetime predicted risk, whereas a significant proportion of subjects had high short_term predicted risk (36% in women and 12% in men). Following surgery, 52% of women and 55% of men have a low short_term/low lifetime predicted risk. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the cardiovascular benefits of BPD_DS and suggest a positive impact on predicted CHD risk in severely obese patients. Long_term studies are needed to confirm our results and to ascertain the effects on CHD risk estimates after BPD_DS surgery."

Clegg"	The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of bariatric (weight loss) surgery for obesity: a systematic review and economic evaluation	2009	https://dx.doi.org/10.3310/hta13410		"OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery for obesity., DATA SOURCES: Seventeen electronic databases were searched [MEDLINE; EMBASE; PreMedline In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations; The Cochrane Library including the Cochrane Systematic Reviews Database, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, DARE, NHS EED and HTA databases; Web of Knowledge Science Citation Index (SCI); Web of Knowledge ISI Proceedings; PsycInfo; CRD databases; BIOSIS; and databases listing ongoing clinical trials] from inception to August 2008. Bibliographies of related papers were assessed and experts were contacted to identify additional published and unpublished references., REVIEW METHODS: Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for eligibility. Inclusion criteria were applied to the full text using a standard form. Interventions investigated were open and laparoscopic bariatric surgical procedures in widespread current use compared with one another and with non-surgical interventions. Population comprised adult patients with body mass index (BMI) > or = 30 and young obese people. Main outcomes were at least one of the following after at least 12 months follow-up: measures of weight change; quality of life (QoL); perioperative and postoperative mortality and morbidity; change in obesity-related comorbidities; cost-effectiveness. Studies eligible for inclusion in the systematic review for comparisons of Surgery versus Surgery were RCTs. For comparisons of Surgery versus Non-surgical procedures eligible studies were RCTs, controlled clinical trials and prospective cohort studies (with a control cohort). Studies eligible for inclusion in the systematic review of cost-effectiveness were full cost-effectiveness analyses, cost-utility analyses, cost-benefit analyses and cost-consequence analyses. One reviewer performed data extraction, which was checked by two reviewers independently. Two reviewers independently applied quality assessment criteria and differences in opinion were resolved at each stage. Studies were synthesised through a narrative review with full tabulation of the results of all included studies. In the economic model the analysis was developed for three patient populations, those with BMI > or = 40; BMI > or = 30 and < 40 with Type 2 diabetes at baseline; and BMI > or = 30 and < 35. Models were applied with assumptions on costs and comorbidity., RESULTS: A total of 5386 references were identified of which 26 were included in the clinical effectiveness review: three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and three cohort studies compared surgery with non-surgical interventions and 20 RCTs compared different surgical procedures. Bariatric surgery was a more effective intervention for weight loss than non-surgical options. In one large cohort study weight loss was still apparent 10 years after surgery, whereas patients receiving conventional treatment had gained weight. Some measures of QoL improved after surgery, but not others. After surgery statistically fewer people had metabolic syndrome and there was higher remission of Type 2 diabetes than in non-surgical groups. In one large cohort study the incidence of three out of six comorbidities assessed 10 years after surgery was significantly reduced compared with conventional therapy. Gastric bypass (GBP) was more effective for weight loss than vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) and adjustable gastric banding (AGB). Laparoscopic isolated sleeve gastrectomy (LISG) was more effective than AGB in one study. GBP and banded GBP led to similar weight loss and results for GBP versus LISG and VBG versus AGB were equivocal. All comparisons of open versus laparoscopic surgeries found similar weight losses in each group. Comorbidities after surgery improved in all groups, but with no significant differences between different surgical interventions. Adverse event reporting varied; mortality ranged from none to 10%. Adverse events from conventional therapy included intolerance to medication, acute cholecystitis and gastrointestin l problems. Major adverse events following surgery, some necessitating reoperation, included anastomosis leakage, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, band slippage and band erosion. Bariatric surgery was cost-effective in comparison to non-surgical treatment in the reviewed published estimates of cost-effectiveness. However, these estimates are likely to be unreliable and not generalisable because of methodological shortcomings and the modelling assumptions made. Therefore a new economic model was developed. Surgical management was more costly than non-surgical management in each of the three patient populations analysed, but gave improved outcomes. For morbid obesity, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) (base case) ranged between 2000 pounds and 4000 pounds per QALY gained. They remained within the range regarded as cost-effective from an NHS decision-making perspective when assumptions for deterministic sensitivity analysis were changed. For BMI > or = 30 and 40, ICERs were 18,930 pounds at two years and 1397 pounds at 20 years, and for BMI > or = 30 and < 35, ICERs were 60,754 pounds at two years and 12,763 pounds at 20 years. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses produced ICERs which were generally within the range considered cost-effective, particularly at the long twenty year time horizons, although for the BMI 30-35 group some ICERs were above the acceptable range., CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery appears to be a clinically effective and cost-effective intervention for moderately to severely obese people compared with non-surgical interventions. Uncertainties remain and further research is required to provide detailed data on patient QoL; impact of surgeon experience on outcome; late complications leading to reoperation; duration of comorbidity remission; resource use. Good-quality RCTs will provide evidence on bariatric surgery for young people and for adults with class I or class II obesity. New research must report on the resolution and/or development of comorbidities such as Type 2 diabetes and hypertension so that the potential benefits of early intervention can be assessed."

A Randomized Pilot Study	2015	https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11695-015-1573-2		"Background: Multimodal protocols may enhance postoperative recovery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of a multimodal protocol in the clinical results, insulin resistance, and inflammatory response to trauma in morbidly obese patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy. Method(s): The population of the study consisted of morbidly obese patients, who were operated using sleeve gastrectomy, from Cuiaba, MT, Brazil, between April and October 2012. Twenty patients were divided into two groups whom received either traditional preoperative care or treatment following the Acerto (accelerating the total recovery of patients in the postoperative period) protocol. The study examined inflammatory response and insulin resistance by measuring levels of glucose, insulin, Homa-IR, reactive C protein, albumin, prealbumin, alpha 1 acid glycoprotein, interleukin 6, and glycosylated hemoglobin. In addition, the study investigated hydration levels, nausea and vomiting, hypertension, and length of hospital stay. Result(s): Patients who followed the Acerto protocol showed no postoperative hypertensive crises (p = 0.03), and 30 % less vomiting (p = 0.35), and showed significant reductions in length of hospital stay, on average of 3 days versus 2 days (p = 0.02). There were not significant statistical differences between the two groups with respect to inflammatory response and insulin resistance (p > 0.05). Conclusion(s): This pilot study suggests that the prescription of the Acerto multimodal protocol for morbidly obese patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy was safe, reduced the rate hypertensive complications, and the length of both ICU and hospital postoperative stay. However, there was no improvement in postoperative insulin resistance or inflammatory acute phase response.Copyright © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Method(s): A total of 105 patients with a body mass index of >=50 kg/m2 were randomly divided into 2 similar groups regarding sex, age, and number of co-morbidities. All underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. In group 1, the length of the biliary limb was 50 cm and the length of the Roux limb was 150 cm. In group 2, the length of the biliary limb was 100 cm and the length of the Roux limb was 250 cm. Result(s): The follow-up for both group was 48 months.

No statistical difference was found in the control or improvement of hypertension, sleep apnea, or gastroesophageal reflux disorder. The excess weight loss was faster in group 1 but was similar in both groups at 48 months (70% in group 1 and 74% in group 2), with no statistical difference. Conclusion(s): Patients with longer biliary and Roux limbs achieved greater type 2 diabetes control, greater lipid disorder improvement, and showed a trend toward faster excess weight loss. © 2008 American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery."

Had_i_"	The influence of 10-week training program on physical ability parameters in bariatric patients	2016	10.1159/000446744	CN-01167759	"Background and Aims: A positive relation between physical activity (PA) and pre_bariatric surgery weight loss requirements has been depicted. However, currently there are no evidence_based pre_operative physical activity guidelines for morbidly obese patients. Our cross_sectional observative pilot study aimed to evaluate the magnitude of differences that can be elicited by simple community based exercise regimen in bariatric patients. There are also limited data about the physical abilities in this population and some of the tests used in the previous studies tend to underestimate the true physical abilities of those patients. Material and Methods: Eleven bariatric patients aged (4 males and 7 females; age range 30_54 years) volunteered to participate in the study that was approved by The National Medical Ethics Committee of the Republic of Slovenia. Patients with cardiopulmonary disease and functional limitation were excluded from the study. Training program (pre_operative intervention) was developed at the Faculty of sport in Ljubljana and included 2 weekly aquatic trainings at the University swimming center and 2 additional weekly training sessions combining aerobic and strength exercises that were mainly performed in the natural environment surrounding the faculty proximity under the supervision of the kinesiology's. Physical ability testing was performed prior and after the intervention and included BIA body composition (InBody 720), handgrip strength testing (Noraxon MyoTrace 400), raising from a chair test in 30 seconds, YMCA bench press and one leg stance test. Systolic and diastolic pressure was measured on a testing day following a 10 minutes rest. Data were processed using SPSS for Windows (ver 21.0; SPSS Inc, Chicage, IL). T_test for pair samples was used to compare the pre and post intervention results. A significance level of 0.05 was used for all tests. Results: Main characteristics of male and female bariatric patients upon enrollment into study are shown in Table 1. The results presented in Table 2 demonstrate positive effects of physical activity alone as patients nutritional habits were not clearly followed after nutritional consultation. However, general consultation of increased protein and lower carbohydrate consumption was advised. The loss of body mass was around 3% (p > 0.05) but there was a significant decrease of body fat percentage that probably correlates the best with the body mass change. Among physical ability parameters, highly positive effects were observed in the handgrip strength and chair rises in 30 seconds. The significant decrease of diastolic pressure was observed due to physical activity. Conclusion: Our pilot study has shown that bariatric patients do benefit in the terms of physical ability and body composition following a simple community based exercise program. Database with suggested tests of physical abilities should be created along with the test normative values in order to combine results from different studies. Training programmed in morbidly obese patients must be supervised. This study was used as a pilot for a larger randomized controlled trial in bariatric patients. Our results strongly suggest individual nutritional support for optimization of metabolic needs. (Table Presented)."

Fouyas"	Interventions for idiopathic intracranial hypertension	2015	https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003434.pub3		"BACKGROUND: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) has an estimated incidence of one to three people per 100,000 people per year, and occurs most commonly in obese, young women. IIH is associated with severe morbidity, notably due to a significant threat to sight and severe headache. Several different management options have been proposed. Conservative measures centre on weight loss. Pharmacological therapy includes use of diuretics. Refractory and sight-threatening cases demand surgical intervention, most often in the form of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion or optic nerve sheath fenestration. Other treatments include venous sinus stenting and bariatric surgery., OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of any intervention for IIH in any patient group., SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2015 Issue 6), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to July 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2015), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 22 July 2015., SELECTION CRITERIA: We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which any intervention was compared to placebo, or to another form of treatment, for people with a clinical diagnosis of IIH., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed the search results for trials to be included in the review. We resolved any discrepancies by third party decision., MAIN RESULTS: We identified two completed RCTs (enrolling a total of 211 participants and conducted in the UK and US) and two ongoing trials that met the inclusion criteria. Both completed trials compared acetazolamide to placebo, in conjunction with a weight loss intervention in both groups. Attrition bias was a problem in both trials with high loss to follow-up, in one study this loss to follow-up occurred particularly in the acetazolamide arm. One trial was unmasked and we judged it to be at risk of performance and detection bias. In these studies, change in visual acuity was similar in the treatment and control groups as measured by logMAR acuity. In one study people in the acetalomazide group had a similar change in logMAR acuity compared to the placebo group between baseline and 12 months in the right eye (MD 0.04 logMAR, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.16) and left eye (MD 0.03 logMAR, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.15). In the other study people in the acetalomazide group had a similar change in vision over six months compared with people in the placebo group (mean difference in change in letters read was 0.01 (95% CI -1.45 to 1.46). One study reported no cases of visual loss in 21 people treated with acetalomazide compared to 2/20 cases in the placebo group (odds ratio 0.17, 95% CI 0.01, 3.82). The prespecified outcome for this review was reduction in CSF pressure to normal levels which was not reported by the two trials. One trial reported that, in a subsample of 85 participants who agreed to lumbar puncture at 6 months, people in the acetalomazide group on average had a greater reduction in CSF pressure (MD -59.9 mmH(2)O, 95% CI -96.4, -23.4). In one study, people in the acetalozamide group on average experienced a greater reduction in papilloedema as assessed by fundus photographs MD -0.70 (95% CI -1.00 to -0.40) and by clinical grading MD -0.91 (95% CI -1.27 to -0.54) between baseline and six months in the study eye.Headache was recorded as present/absent in one study at 12 months (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.12,1.41, 41 participants). Both studies reported headache on visual analogue scales (different ones) but results were inconclusive (MD for change in headache score measured on 10-point visual analogue scale at 12 months was 1.0 (-1.80, 3.70, 41 articipants) and MD for change in headache score on a 6 point scale measured at 6 months was -0.45 (-3.5,2.6, number of participants unclear). In one study, a similar proportion of people in the acetalomazide group were in remission (however, the trial authors did not state their definition of this term) at 12 months compared to the placebo group. However, the 95% CIs were wide and there is considerable uncertainty as to the effect (OR 1.13 (95% CI 0.32 to 3.90, 41 participants). In one study of 185 participants, people in the acetalomazide group had an increased risk of decreased CO2, diarrhoea, dysgeusia, fatigue, nausea, paresthesia, tinnitus and vomiting compared to people in the placebo group. In general, the estimates of effect were uncertain with wide 95% CIs. Adverse effects were not reported in the other study.One study reported that quality of life was better in acetazolamide-treated patients based on the visual quality of life (VFQ-25) (MD 6.35, 95% CI 2.22 to 10.47) and the physical (MD 3.02, 95% CI 0.34 to 5.70) and mental (MD 3.45, 95% CI 0.35 to 6.55) components of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey tool at six months. Costs were not reported in either study. We judged the evidence to be low certainty (GRADE) downgrading for imprecision and risk of bias., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Although the two included RCTs showed modest benefits for acetazolamide for some outcomes, there is insufficient evidence to recommend or reject the efficacy of this intervention, or any other treatments currently available, for treating people with IIH. Further high-quality RCTs are required in order to adequately assess the effect of acetazolamide therapy in people with IIH."
"N. Pirson, E. Patricia and T. Jean-Paul"	Unexpectedly dramatic weight loss in a Prader-Willi syndrome patient treated by Liraglutide	2016	https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17843286.2016.1250435		"Prader-Willi syndrome is the most common genetic disorder responsible for a life-threatening obesity. The weight gain results mostly from hyperphagia, but its physiopathology remains unsettled. Hence, the treatment is generally poorly effective. Liraglutide is a Glugacon-Like Peptide (GLP)-1 analog approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and more recently for the treatment of the obesity. This medication induces generally a moderate weight loss resulting from enhanced satiety. We report the case of a 48-year-old man with a classical PWS associated with a super morbid obesity (W: 179.8 kg and H: 156 cm; BMI 73.9 kg/m2) and type 2 diabetes almost well controlled (HbA1c = 7.1%) with tritherapy (Metformine-Gliclazide-Sitagliptine). In addition to diabetes, obesity was complicated with arterial hypertension, sleep apnea syndrome and hypogonadism. At the first visit in our center, Sitagliptine was stopped for Liraglutide 1.2 mg/day to encourage weight loss. During the next three years, the weight loss was dramatic and continued over the years of treatment with Liraglutide (-90 kg /3 years) to reach a BMI of 37.4 kg/m2, below the threshold of morbid obesity at the most recent visit. In parallel, glycemic control improved markedly allowing a reduction in the hypoglycemic treatment (HbA1c = 5.6%) despite the stop of gliclazide. To our best knowledge, few PWS patients treated by GLP-1 analogs have been reported in the literature. However, in these cases, the amplitude of weight loss was lower and the length of the follow up shorter. Since therapeutic options are limited and bariatric surgery controversial in this population, randomized controlled studies should be designed to assess the efficacy of GLP-1 analogs."

Sharma	Recent developments in the treatment of obesity-related hypertension	2002			"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Obesity is a major public health issue, and hypertension is one of the most common associated co-morbidities. Here, recent developments in the treatment of obesity-related hypertension, published during the past year, are reviewed., RECENT FINDINGS: Several recent studies have examined the effect of dietary and lifestyle changes on hypertension. These studies uniformly confirm that weight reduction together with salt restriction and increased physical exercise can lower blood pressure. Several studies have shown that pharmacologically induced weight reduction with orlistat or sibutramine can likewise be beneficial in the management of obese hypertensive patients. The role of surgery in obesity remains to be defined., SUMMARY: Both non-pharmacologically and pharmacologically induced weight loss can lower blood pressure in obese hypertensive patients. The effects of weight loss and pharmacological management on morbidity and mortality in obese hypertensive patients remains to be addressed in prospective trials."

Two-year follow-up data from the trial were projected over a 40-year time horizon and cost-effectiveness was assessed from the perspective of the National Health Service. Future costs and clinical outcomes were discounted at 3.5% annually and all costs were reported in 2010 pounds sterling. A series of sensitivity analyses were performed., RESULTS: LAGB was associated with benefits in HbA1c, systolic blood pressure, body mass index and serum lipid concentrations, which led to significant increases in discounted life expectancy (an increase of 0.64 years) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (an increase of 0.92 quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) and reduced incidence of diabetes complications relative to SMM. Treatment costs in the LAGB arm increased by 4552 Great British Pounds (GBP), but this was partially offset by cost savings resulting from a reduction in the incidence of all modelled diabetes complications. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of GBP 3602 per QALY in the base case fell well below commonly quoted willingness-to-pay thresholds in the UK setting., CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of data from a recent randomized controlled trial, LAGB is likely to be considered cost-effective from the healthcare payer perspective when compared with SMM of obesity in patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK setting.

"The REDUCE pivotal trial: a prospective, randomized controlled pivotal trial of a dual intragastric balloon for the treatment of obesity"	2015	10.1016/j.soard.2014.12.006	CN-01085004	"BACKGROUND: Saline_filled intragastric balloon devices are reversible endoscopic devices designed to occupy stomach volume and reduce food intake. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a dual balloon system plus diet and exercise in the treatment of obesity compared to diet and exercise alone. SETTING: Academic and community practice, United States. METHODS: Participants (n = 326) with body mass index (BMI) 30_40 kg/m(2) were randomized to endoscopic DBS treatment plus diet and exercise (DUO, n = 187) or sham endoscopy plus diet and exercise alone (DIET, n = 139). Co_primary endpoints were a between_group comparison of percent excess weight loss (%EWL) and DUO subject responder rate, both at 24 weeks. Thereafter DUO patients had the DBS retrieved followed by 24 additional weeks of counseling; DIET patients were offered DBS treatment. RESULTS: Mean BMI was 35.4. Both primary endpoints were met. DUO weight loss was over twice that of DIET. DUO patients had significantly greater %EWL at 24 weeks (25.1% intent_to_treat (ITT), 27.9% completed cases (CC, n = 167) compared with DIET patients (11.3% ITT, P = .004, 12.3% CC, n = 126). DUO patients significantly exceeded a 35% response rate (49.1% ITT, P<.001, 54.5% CC) for weight loss dichotomized at 25%EWL. Accommodative symptoms abated rapidly with support and medication. Balloon deflation occurred in 6% without migrations. Early retrieval for nonulcer intolerance occurred in 9%. Gastric ulcers were observed; a minor device change led to significantly reduced ulcer size and frequency (10%). CONCLUSION: The DBS was significantly more effective than diet and exercise in causing weight loss with a low adverse event profile."

Intragastric balloons (IGBs) are a minimally invasive endoscopic weight loss method recently approved for use in the US. The purpose of the study is to assess the effect of IGBs on metabolic outcomes associated with obesity. Methods MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Database were searched through July 2016. Dual extraction and quality assessment of studies using Cochrane risk of bias tool were performed independently by two authors. Primary outcomes included the change from baseline in metabolic parameters. Secondary outcomes included resolution and/or improvement in metabolic co-morbidities and association with baseline parameters. Results 10 randomized controlled trials (RCT) and 30 observational studies including 5,668 subjects were analyzed. There was moderate-quality evidence for improvement in most metabolic parameters in subjects assigned to IGB therapy as compared to conventional non-surgical therapy in RCTs: mean difference (MD) in fasting glucose change: -12.7 mg/dl (95% confidence interval (CI) -21.5, -4); MD in triglycerides: -19 mg/dl (95% CI -42, 3.5); MD in waist circumference: -4.1 cm (95% CI -6.9, -1.4); MD in diastolic blood pressure: -2.9 mm Hg (95% CI -4.1, -1.8). The odds ratio for diabetes resolution after IGB therapy was 1.4 (95% CI 1.3, 1.6). The rate of serious adverse events was 1.3%. Conclusions IGBs are more effective than diet in improving obesity-related metabolic risk factors with a low rate of adverse effects, however the strength of the evidence is limited given the small number of participants and lack of long-term follow-up."

Increased paracetamol bioavailability after sleeve gastrectomy: a crossover pre-vs. post-operative clinical trial	2019	10.3390/jcm8111949	CN-02092900	"Oral drug bioavailability may be significantly altered after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), the most popular bariatric procedure worldwide. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is the post_bariatric analgesic/antipyretic drug of choice. In this work we studied and analyzed the LSG effects on systemic bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of paracetamol after oral administration of solid vs. liquid dosage form. A 4_armed, pharmacokinetic, crossover trial was performed in patients enrolled for LSG. Single paracetamol dose (500 mg), as caplet (n = 7) or syrup (n = 5), was administered before vs. 4Ð6 months post_LSG. Bioavailability was enhanced after LSG; in the caplet groups, average AUC0Ðt increased from 9.1 to 18.6 µgáh/mL with AUC0Ðt difference of 9.5 µgáh/mL (95% CI 4.6Ð14.5, p = 0.003). Cmax increased from 1.8 (95% CI 1.2Ð2.5) to 4.2 µg/mL (3.6Ð4.8) after LSG (p = 0.032). In the syrup groups, AUC0Ðt increased from 13.4 to 25.6 µgáh/mL, with AUC0Ðt difference of 12.2 µgáh/mL (95% CI 0.9Ð23.5, p = 0.049). Cmax changed from 5.4 (95% CI 2.5Ð8.4) to 7.8 µg/mL (6.1Ð9.6), and systemic bioavailability was complete (102%) after the surgery. Overall, decreased paracetamol exposure in obesity, with recovery to normal drug levels (caplet) or even higher (syrup) post_LSG, was revealed. In conclusion, attention to paracetamol effectiveness/safety in obesity, and after bariatric surgery, is prudent."

The aim of the study was to compare conventional monitoring to an individualized goal-directed therapy (IGDT) regarding the need of perioperative fluids and cardiovascular stability., METHODS: Fifty morbidly obese patients were consecutively scheduled for laparoscopic bariatric surgery (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01873183). The intervention group (IG, n=30) was investigated preoperatively with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and rehydrated with colloid fluids if a low level of venous return was detected. During surgery, IGDT was continued with a pulse-contour device (FloTrac TM). In the control group (CG, n=20), conventional monitoring was conducted. The type and amount of perioperative fluids infused, vasoactive/inotropic drugs administered, and blood pressure levels were registered., RESULTS: In the IG, 213 +/- 204 mL colloid fluids were administered as preoperative rehydration vs. no preoperative fluids in the CG (p<0.001). During surgery, there was no difference in the fluids administered between the groups. Mean arterial blood pressures were higher in the IG vs. the CG both after induction of anesthesia and during surgery (p=0.001 and p=0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: In morbidly obese patients suspected of being hypovolemic, increased cardiovascular stability may be reached by preoperative rehydration. The management of rehydration should be individualized. Additional invasive monitoring does not appear to have any effect on outcomes in obesity surgery."
"L. H. Powell, J. E. Calvin, 3rd and J. E. Calvin, Jr."	Effective obesity treatments	2007			"To curb the epidemic of obesity in the United States, revised Medicare policy allows support for efficacious obesity treatments. This review summarizes the evidence from rigorous randomized trials (9 lifestyle trials, 5 drug trials, and 2 surgical trials) on the efficacy and risk- benefit profile of lifestyle, drug, and surgical interventions aimed at promoting sustained (= 2 years) reductions in weight. Both lifestyle and drug interventions consistently produced an approximate 7-lb (3.2-kg) weight loss that was sustained for 2 years and was associated with improvements in diabetes, blood pressure, and/or cardiovascular risk factors. Surgical interventions have a less solid empirical base but offer promise for the promotion of significant and sustained weight reduction posttreatment in the morbidly obese but with possible significant short-term side effects. In summary, there is strong and consistent support from rigorous randomized trials that lifestyle or drug interventions result in modest weight loss with minimal risks but disproportionate clinical benefit. Combinations of lifestyle, drug, and, where appropriate, surgical interventions may be the most efficacious approach to achieving sustained weight loss for the widest diversity of patients.

St-Onge"	Obesity and Cardiovascular Disease: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association	2021	https://dx.doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000973		"The global obesity epidemic is well established, with increases in obesity prevalence for most countries since the 1980s. Obesity contributes directly to incident cardiovascular risk factors, including dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and sleep disorders. Obesity also leads to the development of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular disease mortality independently of other cardiovascular risk factors. More recent data highlight abdominal obesity, as determined by waist circumference, as a cardiovascular disease risk marker that is independent of body mass index. There have also been significant advances in imaging modalities for characterizing body composition, including visceral adiposity. Studies that quantify fat depots, including ectopic fat, support excess visceral adiposity as an independent indicator of poor cardiovascular outcomes. Lifestyle modification and subsequent weight loss improve both metabolic syndrome and associated systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. However, clinical trials of medical weight loss have not demonstrated a reduction in coronary artery disease rates. In contrast, prospective studies comparing patients undergoing bariatric surgery with nonsurgical patients with obesity have shown reduced coronary artery disease risk with surgery. In this statement, we summarize the impact of obesity on the diagnosis, clinical management, and outcomes of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias, especially sudden cardiac death and atrial fibrillation. In particular, we examine the influence of obesity on noninvasive and invasive diagnostic procedures for coronary artery disease. Moreover, we review the impact of obesity on cardiac function and outcomes related to heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction. Finally, we describe the effects of lifestyle and surgical weight loss interventions on outcomes related to coronary artery disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation."

It has been shown that weight loss is an effective strategy to improve the cardiovascular risk factors. Bariatric surgery, such as RYGB, is indicated in patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 40 kg/m2 or 35 kg/m2 along with comorbidities. Method(s): We conducted a meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials as of January 2021 that evaluated clinical outcomes of RYGB in obese patients when compared to control group of medical and lifestyle therapy. The primary outcome was T2DM remission. Secondary outcomes included hemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), BMI, triglyceride, total cholesterol, high and low density lipoprotein (HDL and LDL), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP). Result(s): Eight randomized clinical trials were included with a total of 228 patients and a median-weighted follow up period of 28.5 months. Heterogeneity was low-high across the trials (0-95%). The primary outcome showed a statistically significant rate of T2DM remission in the RYGB group versus the medical group. Additionally, A1c, FPG, BMI, triglycerides, HDL, LDL, and SBP were statistically lower in the RYGB group. There was no significant difference in total cholesterol and DBP (Figures 1, 2, 3). Conclusion(s): This meta-analysis reveals that RYGB has multiple significant long-term benefits on T2DM and cardiovascular factors. Further larger trials with longer follow up durations are needed to confirm these results.Copyright © 2021"

Hence, one requires a procedure that allows postoperative surveillance of the stomach with the best outcomes in terms of weight control and resolution of co-morbidities. Here, we compare one such procedure, duodenojejunal bypass with sleeve against the standard Roux-en Y gastric bypass., METHODS: Fifty-seven patients who were selected for a bypass procedure were randomized into two groups of laparoscopic duodenojejunal bypass with sleeve (DJB) and laparoscopic Roux en Y gastric bypass. The limb lengths were similar in both the groups, and the sleeve was done over a 36F bougie., RESULTS: The mean body mass index and percent excess weight loss at the end of 3, 6, and 12 months between the groups were not statistically significant. The operating times were higher in the DJB group. The rate of resolution of diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemias were also similar with no statistical significance. There was 100% resolution of dyslipidemias in both groups. There was one patient in the DJB group who presented with internal herniation 1 month post-op and was managed surgically. There was no mortality in both the groups., CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic duodenojejunal with sleeve gastrectomy, a procedure which combines the principles and advantages of sleeve gastrectomy and foregut hypothesis, is a safe and effective alternative to gastric bypass in weight reduction and resolution of co-morbidities especially for Asian countries. But, long-term follow-up is required."

However, there is little evidence that lifestyle modification alters pregnancy outcomes. Bariatric surgery results in significant weight loss. This appears to reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes for the mother but may increase the risk of adverse outcomes for the infant. In order to reduce the risks of obesity_related adverse pregnancy outcomes for both mother and offspring, alternative approaches to the management of obesity in women planning pregnancy are needed. METHODS/DESIGN: This study, a two_arm, parallel group, randomized control trial, will be conducted at the Metabolic Disorders Centre, University of Melbourne. This trial will recruit 164 women aged 18_38 years with a body mass index of 30_55 kg/m2 who plan to conceive in the next 6_12 months. Women will be randomized to one of two 12_week interventions (Group A and Group B). Group A will aim for modest weight loss (MWL; ²_3% body weight) using a hypocaloric diet. Group B will aim for substantial weight loss (SWL; 10_15% body weight) using a modified very low energy diet (VLED) program. All participants will be asked to comply with National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) guidelines for exercise and will be provided with standard pre_pregnancy advice according to Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology guidelines. All participants will then be observed for the subsequent 12 months. If pregnancy occurs within the 12_month follow_up period, data on weight and metabolic status of the mother, and pregnancy outcomes of mother and offspring will be recorded. The primary outcome is maternal fasting plasma glucose at 26_28 weeks' gestation, given that this is known to correlate with pregnancy outcomes. Time to conception, live birth rate, gestational weight gain, and a composite of adverse pregnancy outcomes for mother and baby will comprise the secondary outcomes. DISCUSSION: There is increasing emphasis on obese women losing weight before conception. To date, no randomized controlled trial has demonstrated an effective means of weight loss that results in improved pregnancy outcomes for both mother and baby. This study intends to determine if substantial pre_conception weight loss, achieved using a VLED, improves pregnancy outcomes for mother and baby when compared with standard care. This research will potentially change clinical care of an obese woman planning pregnancy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ANZCTR, 12,614,001,160,628 . Registered on 5 November 2014."

Despite extensive literature, few studies report long-term follow-up in cohorts with adequate retention rates. OBJECTIVE(S): To assess the quality of evidence and treatment effectiveness 2 years after bariatric procedures for weight loss, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia in severely obese adults. EVIDENCE REVIEW: MEDLINE and Cochrane databases were searched from 1946 through May 15, 2014. Search terms included bariatric surgery, individual bariatric procedures, and obesity. Studies were included if they described outcomes for gastric bypass, gastric band, or sleeve gastrectomy performed on patients with a body mass index of 35 or greater, had more than 2 years of outcome information, and had follow-up measures for at least 80% of the initial cohort. Two investigators reviewed each study and a third resolved study inclusion disagreements. FINDINGS: Of 7371 clinical studies reviewed, 29 studies (0.4%, 7971 patients) met inclusion criteria. All gastric bypass studies (6 prospective cohorts, 5 retrospective cohorts) and sleeve gastrectomy studies (2 retrospective cohorts) had 95%confidence intervals for the reported mean, median, or both exceeding 50% excess weight loss. This amount of excess weight loss occurred in 31% of gastric band studies (9 prospective cohorts, 5 retrospective cohorts). The mean sample-size-weighted percentage of excess weight loss for gastric bypass was 65.7% (n = 3544) vs 45.0%(n = 4109) for gastric band. Nine studies measured comorbidity improvement. For type 2 diabetes (glycated hemoglobin <6.5% without medication), sample-size-weighted remission rates were 66.7% for gastric bypass (n = 428) and 28.6% for gastric band (n = 96). For hypertension (blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg without medication), remission rates were 38.2% for gastric bypass (n = 808) and 17.4% for gastric band (n = 247). For hyperlipidemia (cholesterol <200 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein >40 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein <160 mg/dL, and triglycerides <200 mg/dL), remission rates were 60.4% for gastric bypass (n = 477) and 22.7% for gastric band (n = 97). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Very few bariatric surgery studies report long-term results with sufficient patient follow-up to minimize biased results. Gastric bypass has better outcomes than gastric band procedures for long-term weight loss, type 2 diabetes control and remission, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Insufficient evidence exists regarding long-term outcomes for gastric sleeve resections. Copyright 2014 American Medical Association. All rights reserved."

Lancet Respir Med. 2019;7: 303-312"	2019	10.1016/j.jemermed.2019.08.018	CN-01989553	"Endotracheal intubation is a commonly performed procedure in the critically ill patient and is associated with the risk of peri_intubation hypoxemia. These authors attempted to determine if there is an advantage to preoxygenation with non_invasive ventilation versus highflow nasal cannula, which has not previously been studied. Investigators conducted a randomized, parallel group, non_blinded, open_label multicenter trial across 28 intensive care units in France. Statistical analysis was performed under an intention to treat protocol. Study participants were patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure that required intubation via rapid sequence induction. Eligible patients were over 18 years of age and had a respiratory rate >25, signs of distress, or a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of <300. The main exclusion criteria included cardiac arrest, declining mental status with GCS <8, pregnancy, intubation prior to arrival in ICU, recent airway or gastrointestinal surgery, or significant facial fractures. Once patients met inclusion criteria they were randomized and categorized as mild or moderate to severe hypoxemia using a cut off of PaO2/FiO2 ratio of >200mmHg and <200mmHg respectively. In the patients receiving non_invasive ventilation, the ventilator was set to pressure support with a tidal volume between 6ml/kg and 8ml/kg based on ideal body weight, PEEP 5cm H20 and FIO2 of 1.0. These patients received non_invasive ventilation throughout pre_oxygenation and induction until larygoscopy. In the patients receiving high flow nasal cannula it was set at 60 L/min with an FiO2 1.0 and a jaw thrust was performed to ensure airway patency. In the nasal cannula group, the patient received high flow throughout intubation until tube placement was confirmed. Both groups were preoxygenated for 5 minutes. The primary outcome investigated was severe peri_intubation hypoxemia, defined as pulse oximetry < 80% for five seconds or more during the period between rapid sequence intubation and 5 minutes after endotracheal tube placement was confirmed. Multiple secondary safety and efficacy outcomes were recorded, including lowest peri_intubation Sp02 duration of laryngoscopy, number of laryngoscopy attempts, episodes of a systolic pressure <90mmHg, feasibility of the pre_oxygenation method, and others. Over the course of eight months, 2079 patients were intubated, of which 745 patients met eligibility criteria and 322 patients were randomized. In the non_invasive ventilation group, 23% of patients had severe hypoxia compared to 27% in the high flow group (absolute difference _4.2, 95% CI [_13.7_5.5]). In the sub_group of moderate to severe hypoxemia, severe hypoxia occurred at 24% with non_invasive ventilation and 35% with high_flow (absolute difference _11.3, 95% CI [_22.3_0.3]). In the mild to moderate hypoxemia sub_group there was no difference between non_invasive ventilation and high flow oxygen. Overall and in analyses of the sub_groups, there were no differences for any of the secondary outcomes. The authors concluded that when choosing a preoxygenation strategy between high_flow nasal cannula or non_invasive ventilation, overall there were no differences in the rates of peri_intubation hypoxia or late complications. Comments: These results show no difference overall between HFNC and non_invasive ventilation, but in severely hypoxemic patients, this trial appeared to favor non_invasive ventilation over high flow. This makes sense physiologically, understanding that in the critically ill patients there is an element of shunt physiology that is mitigated with alveolar recruitment measures, which non_invasive ventilation provides. While the authors state there is no difference, we should interpret these negative findings with caution, as confidence intervals are wide. Additionally, there were more cardiac arrest events in the HFNC group than in the non_invasive group and since this was still a rare occurence, the difference was not significant but likely underpowered. Knowing the above l mitations, we do not feel this changes current practice, but would tend to choose non_invasive ventilation based on these findings."

Thoracic epidural anaesthesia, by reducing sympathetic stress, may ameliorate the haemodynamic changes occurring during OPCAB surgery. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the impact of thoracic epidural anaesthesia on intraoperative haemodynamics in patients undergoing OPCAB surgery. METHODS: Two hundred and twenty_six patients were randomized to either general anaesthesia plus epidural (GAE) (n = 109) or general anaesthesia (GA) only (n = 117). Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and central venous pressure (CVP) were measured before sternotomy and subsequently after positioning the heart for each distal anastomosis. RESULTS: Both groups were well balanced with respect to baseline characteristics and received a standardized anaesthesia. The MAP decreased in both groups with no significant difference (mean difference (GAE minus GA) _1.11, 95% CI _3.06 to 0.84, P = 0.26). The HR increased in both groups after sternotomy but was significantly less in the GAE group (mean difference (GAE minus GA) _4.29, 95% CI _7.10 to _1.48, P = 0.003). The CVP also increased in both groups after sternotomy, but the difference between the groups varied over time (P = 0.05). A difference was observed at the third anastomosis when the heart was in position for the revascularization of the circumflex artery (mean difference (GAE minus GA) +2.09, 95% CI 0.21_3.96, P = 0.03), but not at other time points. The incidence of new arrhythmias was also significantly lower in the GAE compared with the GA group (OR = 0.41, 95% CI 0.22_0.78, P = 0.01).

We aimed to identify the degree of reduction in excess body weight associated with cardiometabolic changes (lipid panel, liver function tests, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure, glycosylated hemoglobin, and fasting blood glucose) in overweight and obese children., Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus through February 12, 2015. We included randomized controlled trials and cohort studies that evaluated interventions to treat pediatric obesity (medication, surgery, lifestyle, and community-based interventions) with >= a 6-month follow-up. We used a random effects meta-regression approach to assess the association between body mass index (BMI)/weight and cardiometabolic changes., Results: We included 42 studies (37 randomized controlled trials and five cohorts) enrolling 3807 children (mean age, 12.2 years; weight, 74.7 kg; and BMI, 31.7 kg/m2). Studies had overall moderate to low risk of bias. A 1-mm Hg decrease in SBP was significantly associated with a decrease of 0.16 kg/m2 (P = .04) in BMI. A 1-mg/dL increase in HDL was significantly associated with a 0.74-kg decrease in weight (P = .02). A 1-mg/dL decrease in triglycerides was significantly associated with a 0.1-kg decrease in weight (P = .03). The remaining associations were not statistically significant., Conclusions: Weight reduction in children is associated with significant changes in several cardiometabolic outcomes, particularly HDL, SBP, and triglycerides. The magnitude of improvement may help in setting expectations and may inform shared decision-making and counseling."

We appraised the quality of evidence supporting each intervention and assessed the effectiveness on different obesity-related outcomes. Method(s): We conducted a systematic search for systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials evaluating pediatric obesity interventions applied for 6 months. We assessed the quality of evidence for each intervention using GRADE (Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Result(s): From 16 systematic reviews, we identified 133 eligible randomized controlled trials. Physical activity interventions reduced systolic blood pressure and fasting glucose (low to moderate quality of evidence). Dietary interventions with low-carbohydrate diets had a similar effect to low-fat diets in terms of body mass index (BMI) reduction (moderate quality of evidence). Educational interventions reduced waist circumference, BMI, and diastolic blood pressure (low quality of evidence). Pharmacological interventions reduced BMI (metformin, sibutramine, orlistat) and waist circumference (sibutramine, orlistat) and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (sibutramine) but also raised systolic and diastolic blood pressure (sibutramine). Surgical interventions (laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy) resulted in the largest BMI reduction (moderate quality of evidence). Combined interventions consisting of dietary modification, physical activity, behavioral therapy, and education significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure, BMI, and triglycerides. Combined parent-child interventions and parent-only interventions had similar effects on BMI (low quality of evidence). Conclusion(s): Several childhood obesity interventions are effective in improving metabolic and anthropometric measures. A comprehensive multicomponent intervention, however, appears to have the best overall outcomes.Copyright © 2017 by the Endocrine Society."

Although benefit has been shown, prior studies have not evaluated the pain control effects of a single intraoperative bolus. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the postoperative effects of a single intraoperative dose of DMET. SETTINGS: University Hospital, United States. METHODS: This is a prospective, randomized, double_blinded study registered with clinicaltrials.gov (#NCT02604940). Patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux_en_Y gastric bypass surgery were randomized and given either a placebo or an intraoperative DMET bolus, where 1 mg/kg was delivered over 10 minutes at the time of surgical closure. Measured outcomes included the following: postoperative pain scores, patient_controlled analgesia (PCA) opioid consumption, PCA demand bolus attempts, duration of postanesthesia care unit (PACU) stay, and vital signs. Descriptive statistics were recorded as frequencies and compared using _2 analysis, and a Welch's 2_sample t test was used to compare continuous variables. RESULTS: Forty_six participants undergoing laparoscopic Roux_en_Y gastric bypass surgery were randomized into placebo (n_=_20) or DMET (n_=_26) groups. There were no statistical differences in age (45.1 versus 43.2 yr, P_=_.522), sex (80% versus 81% female, P_=_.948), and body mass index (46.1 versus 45.6 kg/m2, P_=_.818) between the 2 groups. There were no statistically significant differences in vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and respiration rate) between DMET and placebo groups in the preoperative and intraoperative period. During the initial 4 hours in the PACU postoperatively, mean heart rate (70 ± 12 versus 86 ± 14, P < .001), systolic blood pressure (107 ± 17 versus 148 ± 16, P < .001), and diastolic blood pressure (56 ± 15 versus 79 ± 13, P < .001) were significantly lower in the DMET_treated group compared with placebo. During the initial 4 hours in the PACU, mean self_reported pain scores were significantly lower in the DMET_treated group (3.6 ± 2.8) compared with the placebo group (6.7 ± 3; P_=_.005). The lower pain scores occurred with no significant difference in the mean opioid dosage received in the PACU between DMET_treated (2.66 ± 2.02 mg) and placebo (3.7 ± 2.3 mg; P_=_.09) groups. Also, there was no statistically significant difference in the total number of PCA attempts for opioids between the DMET_treated and placebo groups (P_=_.49). CONCLUSIONS: A single bolus of DMET (1 mg/kg delivered over 10 min) administered at the time of surgical closure did not reduce immediate PACU usage of opioids but significantly reduced reported pain scores and caused a significant decrease in the number of attempts made by patients; this is a trend of decreased attempts over time (P_=_.04) in the DMET group. The trend of the mean total medication used over time indicates that there is neither an increasing nor decreasing trend for the DMET group, but there is an increasing trend in the total used over time for the placebo group. There was no statistically or clinically significant bradycardia, hypotension, hypoxia, respiratory depression intraoperative duration, or PACU stay. Reduced single bolus dosing of DMET required for analgesia in bariatric surgery patients is optimal from physiologic, level of care, and cost perspectives."

One hundred and thirty-two patients having bariatric surgery were placed in the ramped position and randomly assigned to have their tracheas intubated using either the Macintosh (n=64) or an Airtraq (n=68) laryngoscope. Mean (SD) intubation times were 37 (23) s and 14 (3) s for Macintosh and Airtraq, respectively (p<0.0001). Compared with the Macintosh laryngoscope, the Airtraq laryngoscope provided an improved vocal cord view as assessed by the Cormack and Lehane score (number of patients with Cormack-Lehane scores of 1/2/3/4/37/20/4/3 for the Macintosh, and 65/3/0/0 for the Airtraq laryngoscopes, p<0.0001). One patient in the Macintosh group had a failed intubation and intubation was achieved with the Airtraq.

Agrawal"	Renal outcomes of bariatric surgery in obese adults with diabetic kidney disease	2014	https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40620-014-0078-8		"Obesity is a pandemic with several significant adverse health outcomes. Chronic kidney disease has been an overlooked consequence of obesity. Among diabetics, obesity is known to amplify the risk for kidney disease. Although bariatric surgery promises significant and sustained weight reduction with favorable impact on metabolic parameters such as glycemic control, hypertension and dyslipidemia, its impact on the renal complications of diabetes is poorly understood. This paper aims to comprehensively evaluate the evidence in the published literature on the impact of bariatric surgery on renal outcomes in obese adults with diabetic kidney disease. While many observational studies have demonstrated significant reduction in proteinuria after bariatric surgery, there is paucity of data regarding changes in renal filtration function such as doubling of serum creatinine or progression to end stage kidney disease. No randomized controlled trials comparing medical vs. surgical therapy in obese adults with diabetic kidney disease exist, hence assessing the metabolic benefits vs. the surgical risks is important before recommending bariatric surgery to this growing patient population. Future studies require a collaborative effort between bariatric surgeons and nephrologists to measure long-term effects of bariatric surgery on renal outcomes incorporating evolving markers of kidney injury to advance this field."

Though widely performed, no consensus exists regarding the optimal bougie size. Published outcome comparisons of different bougie sizes, lack mid-term outcome data. The main concern of utilizing larger bougies is the possible attenuation of the restrictive effect with stomach dilatation over time. Objective(s): Compare the mid-term effect of using a 42 Fr Vs 32 Fr bougie size on weight and weight-related comorbidities. Method(s): Patients were randomly assigned to undergo SG with 42 Fr (group A) and 32Fr bougie (group B). Weight, BMI and comorbidities were compared between the time of surgery, and 4 years later. Result(s): Group A consisted of 59 patients and group B of 42 patients. Mean age (A-40.8 +/- 11.6 years; B-44.4 +/- 11.55 years), weight (A-118.8 +/- 17.4 Kg; B-121+/- 19.1 Kg) and BMI (A-42.6 +/- 3.8; B-43.7 +/- 6.5) were similar (P=NS). Four years Post-surgery, both groups maintained the same weight reduction rate with similar mean BMI (A-31.2 +/- 5.0; B-31.8 +/- 5.2) and excess weight loss (A-65.5 +/- 28%; B-64.8 +/- 24.4%) (p=NS). Similar improvement of comorbidities was apparent in both groups: complete remission or improvement of hypertension: (A-84.2%; B-77% P=0.6), type 2 diabetes mellitus (A-94.1%; B-77.8%. P= 0.16) and dyslipidemia (A-70.6%; B-88.9%. P= 0.17) Conclusion(s): There is no effect of bougie size (between 32Fr and 42Fr) on mid-term major outcome measures of SG."

Dietary and medical weight loss strategies are frequently unsuccessful and unsustainable. Bariatric surgery is quite effective, but is reserved for the most obese patients because of the associated intraoperative/post-operative risks. In preclinical and early clinical case series, a novel therapy, transcatheter bariatric embolotherapy (TBE) of the left gastric artery, has been reported to promote weight loss by reducing ghrelin, an appetite-stimulating hormone secreted from the gastric fundus., OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine TBE in a single-blind, sham procedure randomized trial., METHODS: Obese subjects (body mass index 35 to 55 kg/m2) were randomized 1:1 to either sham or TBE targeting the left gastric artery using an occlusion balloon microcatheter to administer 300- to 500-mum embolic beads. All patients entered a lifestyle counseling program. Patients and physicians performing follow-up were blind to the allocated therapy. Endoscopy was performed at baseline and 1-week post-procedure. The primary endpoint was 6-month total body weight loss (TBWL)., RESULTS: Eligible subjects (n = 44; age 45.5 +/- 9.4 years; 8 men/36 women; body mass index 39.6 +/- 3.8 kg/m2) were randomized to undergo the sham or TBE procedure with no device-related complications and 1 vascular complication. Patients reported mild nausea and vomiting, and endoscopy revealed only minor self-limiting ulcers in 5 patients. At 6 months, in both the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations, the TBWL was greater with TBE (7.4 kg/6.4% and 9.4 kg/8.3% loss, respectively) than sham (3.0 kg/2.8% and 1.9 kg/1.8%, respectively; p = 0.034/0.052 and p = 0.0002/0.0011, respectively). The TBWL was maintained with TBE at 12 months (intention-to-treat 7.8 kg/6.5% loss, per-protocol 9.3 kg/9.3% loss; p = 0.0011/0.0008, p = 0.0005/0.0005, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized pilot trial, we have established the proof-of-principle that transcatheter bariatric embolotherapy of the left gastric artery is well-tolerated and promotes clinically significant weight loss over a sham procedure.(The Lowering Weight in Severe Obesity by Embolization of the Gastric Artery Trial [LOSEIT]; NCT03185949).

Studies reporting invasive hemodynamic measures before and following therapeutic weight loss interventions in patients with obesity but no clinically overt heart failure were extracted., RESULTS: A total of 9 studies were identified, providing data for 110 patients. Six studies tested dietary intervention and 3 studies tested bariatric surgery. Over a median duration of 9.7 months (range 0.75 to 23.0 months), a median weight loss of 43 kg (range 10 to 58 kg) was associated with significant reductions in heart rate (-9 beats/min, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -12 to -6; p < 0.001), mean arterial pressure (-7 mm Hg, 95% CI: -11 to -3; p < 0.001), and resting oxygen consumption (-85 ml/min, 95% CI: -111 to -60; p < 0.001). Central cardiac hemodynamics improved, manifested by reductions in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (-3 mm Hg, 95% CI: -5 to -1; p < 0.001) and mean pulmonary artery pressure (-5 mm Hg, 95% CI: -8 to -2; p = 0.001). Exercise hemodynamics were assessed in a subset of patients (n = 49) in which there was significant reduction in exercise pulmonary artery pressure (p = 0.02)., CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic weight loss in obese patients without HF is associated with favorable hemodynamic effects.

However, studies have been limited in most settings by lack of a nonsurgical group, losses to follow-up, missing data, and small sample sizes in clinical trials and observational studies., Objective: To assess the association of 3 common types of bariatric surgery compared with nonsurgical treatment with mortality and other clinical outcomes among obese patients., Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study in a large Israeli integrated health fund covering 54% of Israeli citizens with less than 1% turnover of members annually. Obese adult patients who underwent bariatric surgery between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2014, were selected and compared with obese nonsurgical patients matched on age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and diabetes, with a final follow-up date of December 31, 2015. A total of 33540 patients were included in this study., Exposures: Bariatric surgery (laparoscopic banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy) or usual care obesity management only (provided by a primary care physician and which may include dietary counseling and behavior modification)., Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome, all-cause mortality, matched and adjusted for BMI prior to surgery, age, sex, socioeconomic status, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and smoking., Results: The study population included 8385 patients who underwent bariatric surgery (median age, 46 [IQR, 37-54] years; 5490 [65.5%] women; baseline median BMI, 40.6 [IQR, 38.5-43.7]; laparoscopic banding [n = 3635], gastric bypass [n = 1388], laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy [n = 3362], and 25155 nonsurgical matched patients (median age, 46 [IQR, 37-54] years; 16470 [65.5%] women; baseline median BMI, 40.5 [IQR, 37.0-43.5]). The availability of follow-up data was 100% for all-cause mortality. There were 105 deaths (1.3%) among surgical patients during a median follow-up of 4.3 (IQR, 2.8-6.6) years (including 61 [1.7%] who underwent laparoscopic banding, 18 [1.3%] gastric bypass, and 26 [0.8%] sleeve gastrectomy), and 583 deaths (2.3%) among nonsurgical patients during a median follow-up of 4.0 (IQR, 2.6-6.2) years. The absolute difference was 2.51 (95% CI, 1.86-3.15) fewer deaths/1000 person-years in the surgical vs nonsurgical group. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality among nonsurgical vs surgical patients were 2.02 (95% CI, 1.63-2.52) for the entire study population; by surgical type, HRs were 2.01 (95% CI, 1.50-2.69) for laparoscopic banding, 2.65 (95% CI, 1.55-4.52) for gastric bypass, and 1.60 (95% CI, 1.02-2.51) for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy., Conclusions and Relevance: Among obese patients in a large integrated health fund in Israel, bariatric surgery using laparoscopic banding, gastric bypass, or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, compared with usual care nonsurgical obesity management, was associated with lower all-cause mortality over a median follow-up of approximately 4.5 years. The evidence of this association adds to the limited literature describing beneficial outcomes of these 3 types of bariatric surgery compared with usual care obesity management alone."
T. Reinehr	The Long term effects of adolescent obesity	2021	https://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000518849		"Adolescent obesity has an immense burden of disease and results in premature death due to several mechanisms: The classic cardiovascular risk factors associated with obesity, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus, lead to cardiovascular diseases and consequently to premature death. Furthermore, adolescent obesity is associated with many life- limiting cancer types occurring 10 to 20 years later replacing smoking as the leading modifiable cause for cancer. However, obesity in adolescence has major implications not only for the affected adolescents but also for society. Obesity in adolescents is associated with a range of social problems, including difficulties securing an apprenticeship or a job or finding a partner. Adolescents with obesity are also at increased risk of having children with obesity later in life. All these consequences lead to high costs for the health-care system. It is quite clear that obesity in adolescence is associated with increased health-care use (direct cost) as well as indirect costs (productivity losses including sick-leave days, long-term incapacity, early retirement and premature death). Additionally, adolescents with obesity might be less able to contribute to financing our social system when they are adults since they have likely problems to get an employment. Although efficient treatment options are available that have been proven in randomized controlled trials, such as lifestyle interventions, drugs and bariatric surgery for adolescents with severe obesity, these interventions fail frequently in clinical practice as most adolescents with obesity do not seek medical care. Furthermore, adolescent patients are characterized by low treatment adherence. In conclusion, since adolescent obesity leads to reduce quality of life, many social problems, premature death, and immense costs not only for our health system, we have to identify and overcome treatment barriers and have to optimize treatment approaches even if our present attempts fail frequently."

RCTs that assigned adults with obesity to either an exercise training group or a no-exercise group after bariatric surgery were included. The primary outcomes were weight loss and physical function. Study bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and the quality of evidence was assessed using GRADEpro., RESULTS: A total of eight studies met the inclusion criteria (n=347 participants). Most of the studies carried a low risk of bias due to randomisation and blinding. Compared with those without exercise intervention after surgery, patients engaging in physical exercise were associated with greater weight loss (weighted mean difference (WMD) -1.94 kg; 95% CI -3.18 to -0.69; n=8) and longer 6 min walk distance (6MWD; WMD29.67 m; 95% CI 25.97 to 33.37; n=2) during follow-up. By subgroup analyses, the additional weight loss in exercise group was related to the starting time and type of exercise: patients engaging in exercise 1 year or more after surgery and patients received aerobic-resistance exercise experienced more weight loss. Besides, patients in exercise training group also had lower systolic blood pressure and resting heart rate after surgery. The quality of evidence for these outcomes was moderate to very low., CONCLUSIONS: Physical exercise after bariatric surgery provides 1.94 kg additional weight loss and 29.67 m longer 6MWD compared with surgery alone. Moreover, engaging in exercise 1 year or more after surgery, and a combined aerobic and resistance training programme may result in greater weight loss.

Unfortunately, to date, there have been no clinical trials to guide treatment of IIH. Current treatment consists of medical and surgical therapy. Medical therapy with weight loss and diuretics, for example, acetazolamide, is typically the mainstay of treatment for IIH. Patients who fail medical therapy due to intolerance, non-compliance, or patients with fulminant IIH may require further surgical treatment. The decision of which surgical procedure is optimal depends on the patient's predominant symptoms (refractory headache vs risk of vision loss), the availability of local oculoplastic/neurosurgical expertise (optic nerve sheath fenestration or shunting) and patient preference.

Recent results from the German DJBL registry confirmed substantial positive metabolic effects of the DJBL in type 2 diabetes. However, the last Food and Drug Administration trial was stopped due to a high occurrence of hepatic abscesses (3.5%)., OBJECTIVES: Here, we analyzed time courses of development of co-morbidities, nutritive changes, and occurrence of adverse events during the 1-year treatment phase with the DJBL in the German DJBL registry., METHODS: Sixty-six patients from the registry were analyzed for efficacy, safety, and nutritional status. Patient data sets were analyzed at implantation, 3 and 6 months after implantation, and at explantation visits., RESULTS: Weight, body mass index, glycated hemoglobin, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol primarily declined during the first 3 months after implantation, whereas systolic and diastolic blood pressure were predominantly reduced during the second half of the treatment phase. Severe DJBL-associated side effects were mainly documented at the explantation visit (intestinal obstruction [1.7%], dislocation [1.7%], and liver abscess [1.7%]). Measurements of serum concentrations of ferritin, albumin, vitamin B12, folic acid, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25 OH-Vit-D3), and calcium provided suggestive evidence of a possible decrease of nutritional absorption of vitamins and trace elements by the DJBL., CONCLUSIONS: The DJBL demonstrates high efficacy with substantial improvement of all parameters of the metabolic syndrome and the potential for reduction of comedications in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes. These registry results are important to optimize recommendations for adaptation of concomitant medication, surveillance of adverse events, nutritional status and supplementation, and adaptation of the implantation period of the DJBL.

Recent data from the German DJBL registry provide evidence for substantial efficacy of the DJBL during the implantation period in obese patients with T2DM. However, little is known about the trends of glycemic control, BMI, and comorbidities after explantation of the DJBL, which have been investigated in the registry in this report., METHODS: Patients were selected from the registry if they had a dataset at implantation, explantation, and at least one time point after explantation of the DJBL (n = 77). We also investigated a subgroup of patients with available data at least 1 year (-2 weeks) after explantation of the DJBL (n = 32)., RESULTS: For a mean BMI at implantation and a mean follow-up period, an increase of BMI of 2.1 kg/m2 (CI 0.8-3.2; p = 0.013) had to be expected (for HbA1c 0.3% (CI - 0.0-0.7; p = n.s.), respectively). In the subgroup analysis, HbA1c and BMI increased after explantation of the DJBL but stayed significantly below baseline levels. Meanwhile, the mean number of antidiabetic drugs slightly increased. There was deterioration seen for blood pressure and LDL cholesterol over the postexplantation period to approximately baseline levels (or higher)., CONCLUSION: With this data, we show that improvement of HbA1c and BMI can be partly maintained over a time of nearly 1-year postexplantation of the DJBL. However, for HbA1c, this may be biased by intensified medical treatment and effects deteriorated with time after explantation. These results suggest that implantation of the DJBL needs to be integrated in a long-term weight management program as most of other interventions in obese patients with T2DM., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02731859."

Five-year outcomes after laparoscopic gastric bypass and laparoscopic duodenal switch in patients with body mass index of 50 to 60: a randomized clinical trial	2015	10.1001/jamasurg.2014.3579	CN-01075857	"IMPORTANCE: There is no consensus as to which bariatric procedure is preferred to reduce weight and improve health in patients with a body mass index higher than 50. OBJECTIVE: To compare 5_year outcomes after Roux_en_Y gastric bypass (gastric bypass) and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (duodenal switch). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized clinical open_label trial at Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway, and Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden. Participants were recruited between March 17, 2006, and August 20, 2007, and included 60 patients aged 20 to 50 years with a body mass index of 50 to 60. The current study provides the 5_year follow_up analyses by intent to treat, excluding one participant accepted for inclusion who declined being operated on prior to knowing to what group he was randomized. INTERVENTIONS: Laparoscopic gastric bypass and laparoscopic duodenal switch. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Body mass index and secondary outcomes including anthropometric measures, cardiometabolic risk factors, pulmonary function, vitamin status, gastrointestinal symptoms, health_related quality of life, and adverse events. RESULTS: Sixty patients were randomly assigned and operated on with gastric bypass (n_=_31) and duodenal switch (n_=_29). Fifty_five patients (92%) completed the study. Five years after surgery, the mean reductions in body mass index were 13.6 (95% CI, 11.0_16.1) and 22.1 (95% CI, 19.5_24.7) after gastric bypass and duodenal switch, respectively. The mean between_group difference was 8.5 (95% CI, 4.9_12.2; P_<_.001). Remission rates of type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome and changes in blood pressure and lung function were similar between groups. Reductions in total cholesterol, low_density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and fasting glucose were significantly greater after duodenal switch compared with gastric bypass. Serum concentrations of vitamin A and 25_hydroxyvitamin D were significantly reduced after duodenal switch compared with gastric bypass. Duodenal switch was associated with more gastrointestinal adverse effects. Health_related quality of life was similar between groups. Patients with duodenal switch underwent more surgical procedures related to the initial procedure (13 [44.8%] vs 3 [9.7%] patients; P_=_.002) and had significantly more hospital admissions compared with patients with gastric bypass. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In patients with a body mass index of 50 to 60, duodenal switch resulted in greater weight loss and greater improvements in low_density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, and glucose levels 5 years after surgery compared with gastric bypass while improvements in health_related quality of life were similar. However, duodenal switch was associated with more surgical, nutritional, and gastrointestinal adverse effects. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00327912."

Following standard gastric bypass, many of these patients still have a BMI greater than 40 after peak weight loss., Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of standard gastric bypass vs distal gastric bypass in patients with a BMI of 50 to 60., Design, Setting, and Participants: Double-blind, randomized clinical parallel-group trial at 2 tertiary care centers in Norway (Oslo University Hospital and Vestfold Hospital Trust) between May 2011 and April 2013. The study included 113 patients with a BMI of 50 to 60 aged 20 to 60 years. The 2-year follow-up was completed in May 2015., Interventions: Standard gastric bypass (alimentary limb, 150 cm) and distal gastric bypass (common channel, 150 cm), both with a biliopancreatic limb of 50 cm and a gastric pouch of about 25 mL., Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was the change in BMI from baseline until 2 years after surgery. Secondary outcomes were cardiometabolic risk factors, nutritional outcomes, adverse events, gastrointestinal symptoms, and health-related quality of life., Results: At baseline, the mean age of the patients was 40 years (95% CI, 38-41 years), 65% were women, mean BMI was 53.5 (95% CI, 52.9-54.0), and mean weight was 158.8 kg (95% CI, 155.3-162.3 kg). The mean reduction in BMI was 17.8 (95% CI, 16.9-18.6) after standard gastric bypass and 17.2 (95% CI, 16.3-18.0) after distal gastric bypass, and the mean between-group difference was 0.6 (95% CI, -0.6 to 1.8; P = .32). Reductions in mean levels of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were greater after distal gastric bypass than standard gastric bypass, and between-group differences were 19 mg/dL (95% CI, 11-27 mg/dL ) and 28 mg/dL (95% CI, 21 to 34 mg/dL), respectively (P < .001 for both). Reductions in fasting glucose levels and hemoglobin A1c were greater after distal gastric bypass. Secondary hyperparathyroidism and loose stools were more frequent after distal gastric bypass. The number of adverse events and changes in health-related quality of life did not differ between the groups. Importantly, 1 patient developed liver failure and 2 patients developed protein-caloric malnutrition treated by elongation of the common channel following distal gastric bypass., Conclusions and Relevance: Distal gastric bypass was not associated with a greater BMI reduction than standard gastric bypass 2 years after surgery. However, we observed different changes in cardiometabolic risk factors and nutritional markers between the groups., Trial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00821197."

Data from several animal studies suggest that the degree and time of calorie restriction (CR) onset, the timing of food intake as well as diet composition, play major roles in promoting health and longevity, breaking the old dogma that only calorie intake is important in extending healthy lifespan. Data from human studies indicate that long-term CR with adequate intake of nutrients results in several metabolic adaptations that reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and cancer. Moreover, CR opposes the expected age-associated alterations in myocardial stiffness, autonomic function, and gene expression in the human skeletal muscle. However, it is possible that some of the beneficial effects on metabolic health are not entirely due to CR, but to the high quality diets consumed by the CR practitioners, as suggested by data collected in individuals consuming strict vegan diets. More studies are needed to understand the interactions among single nutrient modifications (e.g. protein/aminoacid, fatty acids, vitamins, phytochemicals, and minerals), the degree of CR and the frequency of food consumption in modulating anti-aging metabolic and molecular pathways, and in the prevention of age-associated diseases. © 2013 Elsevier B.V."

However, the efficacy and safety outcomes of this procedure remain debated. We report the results of a randomised trial (YOMEGA) comparing the outcomes of OAGB versus standard Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB)., METHODS: This prospective, multicentre, randomised non-inferiority trial, was held in nine obesity centres in France. Patients were eligible for inclusion if their body-mass index (BMI) was 40 kg/m2 or higher, or 35 kg/m2 or higher with the presence of at least one comorbidity (type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, obstructive sleep apnoea, dyslipidaemia, or arthritis), and were aged 18-65 years. Key exclusion criteria were a history of oesophagitis, Barrett's oesophagus, severe gastro-oesophageal reflux disease resistant to proton-pump inhibitors, and previous bariatric surgery. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to OAGB or RYGB, stratified by centre with blocks of variable size; the study was open-label, with no masking required. RYGB consisted of a 150 cm alimentary limb and a 50 cm biliary limb and OAGB of a single gastrojejunal anastomosis with a 200 cm biliopancreatic limb. The primary endpoint was percentage excess BMI loss at 2 years. The primary endpoint was assessed in the per-protocol population and safety was assessed in all randomised participants. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02139813, and is now completed., FINDINGS: From May 13, 2014, to March 2, 2016, of 261 patients screened for eligibility, 253 (97%) were randomly assigned to OAGB (n=129) or RYGB (n=124). Five patients did not undergo their assigned surgery, and after undergoing their surgery 14 were excluded from the per-protocol analysis (seven due to pregnancy, two deaths, one withdrawal, and four revisions from OAGB to RYGB) In the per-protocol population (n=117 OAGB, n=117 RYGB), mean age was 43.5 years (SD 10.8), mean BMI was 43.9 kg/m2 (SD 5.6), 176 (75%) of 234 participants were female, and 58 (27%) of 211 with available data had type 2 diabetes. After 2 years, mean percentage excess BMI loss was -87.9% (SD 23.6) in the OAGB group and -85.8% (SD 23.1) in the RYGB group, confirming non-inferiority of OAGB (mean difference -3.3%, 95% CI -9.1 to 2.6). 66 serious adverse events associated with surgery were reported (24 in the RYGB group vs 42 in the OAGB group; p=0.042), of which nine (21.4%) in the OAGB group were nutritional complications versus none in the RYGB group (p=0.0034)., INTERPRETATION: OAGB is not inferior to RYGB regarding weight loss and metabolic improvement at 2 years. Higher incidences of diarrhoea, steatorrhoea, and nutritional adverse events were observed with a 200 cm biliopancreatic limb OAGB, suggesting a malabsorptive effect., FUNDING: French Ministry of Health.

J. L. Roerig and K. Steffen	Psychopharmacology and Bariatric Surgery	2015	https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/erv.2396		"Currently, it has been demonstrated that psychotropic drugs, particularly antidepressants, are frequently prescribed for patients who seek bariatric surgery. Many bariatric surgery patients have a history of a mood disorder. Unlike medications for diabetes, hypertension or hyperlipidemia, which are generally reduced and at times discontinued, postsurgery antidepressants use is only slightly reduced. The Roux-en-Y procedure is most frequently associated with alteration in drug exposure. Medication disintegration, dissolution, absorption, metabolism and excretion have been found to be altered in postbariatric patients, although data are sparse at this time. This paper will review the current evidence regarding the effect of bariatric surgery on drug treatment including mechanism of interference as well as the extent of changes identified to date.

The effect of bariatric surgery on cardiovascular events in obese individuals with type 2 diabetes remains to be determined. The Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study is a prospective, controlled intervention study that examines the effects of bariatric surgery on hard end points. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of bariatric surgery on cardiovascular events in the SOS study participants with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS _ All SOS study participants with type 2 diabetes at baseline were included in the analyses (n = 345 in the surgery group and n = 262 in the control group). Mean follow_up was 13.3 years (interquartile range 10.2_16.4) for all cardiovascular events. RESULTS _ Bariatric surgery was associated with a reduced myocardial infarction incidence (38 events among the 345 subjects in the surgery group vs. 43 events among the 262 subjects in the control group; log_rank P = 0.017; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.56 [95% CI 0.34_0.93]; P = 0.025). No effect of bariatric surgery was observed on stroke incidence (34 events among the 345 subjects in the surgery group vs. 24 events among the 262 subjects in the control group; log_rank P = 0.852; adjusted HR 0.73 [0.41_1.30]; P = 0.29). The effect of surgery in reducing myocardial infarction incidence was stronger in individuals with higher serum total cholesterol and triglycerides at baseline (interaction P value = 0.02 for both traits). BMI (interaction P value = 0.12) was not related to the surgery outcome. CONCLUSIONS _ Bariatric surgery reduces the incidence of myocardial infarction in obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. Preoperative BMI should be integrated with metabolic parameters to maximize the benefits of bariatric surgery. 2012 by the American Diabetes Association."

Scientific community works everyday trying to ameliorate this burden. Only in the year 2004 around 2,790 publications about the therapeutic use of antihypertensive agents can be found in MEDLINE. Despite this overwhelming effort and information, only a relatively short number of manuscripts have a real impact in clinical practice. For the busy clinician, it becomes almost impossible to screen and be updated with the landmark publications. The purpose of this article is to provide concise information related to prevention of CVD. We reviewed publications in the past 5 years regarding cardiovascular risk factors with special attention to dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, smoking cessation and obesity, discussing some new findings and treatments. We also discuss obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as a recently identified cardiovascular risk factor, and provide a general overview about its pathophysiology and treatment."

Obesity comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and atherosclerosis, are costly for patients and governments. The treatment of obesity involves several facets, including lifestyle changes, bariatric surgery, and pharmacotherapy. As changes in lifestyle require considerable patient commitment that is sometimes unachievable, and surgery is expensive and invasive, pharmacotherapy is the primary option for most patients. This review describes the pharmacotherapy currently available in the USA, Europe, and Brazil, focusing on its limitations. We then analyze the results from clinical trials of new drug candidates. Most drugs cause weight loss of < 4 kg compared with controls, and severe adverse effects have caused a number of drugs to be withdrawn from the market in several countries. Drugs under development have not shown more significant weight loss or reduced adverse effects. We conclude that a significant portion of obese patients have few treatment options because of the adverse effects and minimal weight loss associated with current pharmacotherapy. However, drugs currently under development appear unable to change this scenario in the near future. Thus, it is essential that new compounds are developed and new molecular targets studied so obesity can be efficiently treated in all patients in the future."

Generalized improvement of MVD is an important goal in obesity treatment. Since skin MVD mirrors generalized systemic MVD, skin microvascular investigation in prospective studies in Ob_P may surrogate microvascular investigation in organs more important for cardiovascular risk of the studied patients. In this prospective study, we measured forearm skin post_occlusive reactive hyperaemia (PORH), as percentage flow increase from baseline, and skin vasomotion in 37 Ob_P before Roux_en_Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and in 24 of them about 1 year after RYGB, using laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF). The spectral contribution of skin LDF signal oscillations in the frequency intervals of 0.01_0.02 Hz, 0.02_0.06 Hz, and 0.06_0.2 Hz_corresponding to endothelial_, sympathetic_, and myogenic_dependent vasomotion, respectively, was measured by means of spectral Fourier analysis. The same measurements were also performed in 28 healthy, lean subjects (HLS). Before RYGB, Ob_P had a significant reduction in PORH and in the all vasomotion parameters investigated, compared with HLS. After RYGB, Ob_P who completed the follow_up, had a significant weight loss (40 kg on average), together with a full normalisation in PORH and in vasomotion parameters, regardless of diabetes status. Surgically induced sustained weight loss resulted in full normalisation of skin microvascolar function in Ob_P about 1 year after RYGB. This result suggests a beneficial effect of sustained weight loss on generalized MVD of the studied Ob_P. 2010 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC."

Endoscopic interventions have been developed as potential alternatives to those not eligible or fearful of the risks of metabolic surgery., METHODS: In this multicenter open-label RCT, 170 adults with inadequately controlled T2DM and obesity were randomized to intensive medical care with or without the DJBL. Primary outcome was the percentage of participants achieving a glycated hemoglobin reduction of >=20% at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included weight loss and cardiometabolic risk factors at 12 and 24 months., RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the percentage of patients achieving the primary outcome between both groups at 12 months [DJBL 54.6% (n = 30) vs control 55.2% (n = 32); odds ratio (OR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.44-2.0; P = 0.85].

These procedures also dramatically improve other metabolic conditions, including hyperlipidemia and hypertension, in both obese and nonobese patients. Several studies have provided evidence that these metabolic effects are not simply the results of drastic weight loss and decreased caloric intake but might be attributable, in part, to endocrine changes resulting from surgical manipulation of the gastrointestinal tract. In this Review, we provide an overview of the clinical evidence that demonstrates the effects of such interventions-termed metabolic surgery-on T2DM and discuss the implications for future research. In light of the evidence presented here, we speculate that the gastrointestinal tract might have a role in the pathophysiology of T2DM and obesity."

The increased cardiovascular risk is one of the main causes for death of obese, metabolic ill patients. Sustainable and efficient therapeutic options are needed. Summary: Metabolic surgery not only permits a substantial and lasting weight loss but also ameliorates metabolic co-morbidities and reduces cardiovascular risk and mortality of obese patients. Most existing data focused on T2D, but evidence for other metabolic co-morbidities such as NAFLD, AHT, and OSAS increase constantly. After metabolic surgery, glycemic control of diabetic patients is superior compared to conservative treatment. Also, diabetes related micro-and macrovascular complications are reduced after surgery, and the median life expectancy is over 9 years longer. In patients with MAFLD, metabolic surgery leads to reduction of steatosis and fibrosis while the risk to develop a hepatocellular carcinoma is reduced significantly. Patients with OSAS have an improved lung function and continuous pressure airway treatment during the night is unnecessary in many patients. Patients with AHT need significantly less or even no antihypertensive medication after surgery and the hazard ratio of death is reduced by 49.2%. Therefore, the focus in treating obese and metabolic ill patients is no longer on pure weight loss but on improvement of co-morbidities and reduction of mortality. This is reflected by the updated S3-guidelines of 2018 that provide nationally established consistent guidelines with clear indications for metabolic surgery no longer focusing on body mass index (BMI) only. This article aims to give an overview over the existing literature concerning surgical treatment options for metabolic syndrome. Key Messages: Metabolic co-morbidities impact life-quality and life expectancy of obese patients. Metabolic surgery offers the chance to treat those metabolic co-morbidities independently of the preoperative BMI and should be considered early as a treatment option for obese patients.© 2022 S.

The aim of this study was to compare the effect of SG, RYGB, and OAGB, on short- and long-term weight loss and comorbidities resolution., METHODS: A prospective randomized clinical study of all morbidly obese patients undergoing SG, RYGB, and OAGB, as primary bariatric procedures, was performed. Patients were randomly assigned into 3 groups: those patients undergoing SG, those ones undergoing RYGB and those ones undergoing OAGB. BMI, excess BMI loss (EBMIL) and remission of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), hypertension (HT), and dyslipidemia (DL) were assessed., RESULTS: 600 patients were included in the study, 200 in each group. Follow-up rate at 5 years postoperatively was 91% in SG group, 92% in RYGB, and 90% in OAGB. OAGB achieves significantly greater EBMIL than RYGB and SG at 1, 2, and 5 years (p < 0.001, respectively). At 5 years, OAGB achieves significantly greater remission of T2DM (p = 0.027), HT (p = 0.006), and DL (p < 0.001) than RYGB and SG. RYGB did not show significant superiority than SG in short- and long-term remission of T2DM and HT, but achieves greater remission of DL (p < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: OAGB achieves superior mid- and long-term weight loss than RYGB and SG. There are no significant differences in weight loss between SG and RYGB at 1, 2, and 5 years. OAGB achieves better short- and long-term resolution rates of DM, HT, and DL than SG and RYGB.

The aim of this study was to compare the effect of a BPL of 70 vs 120 cm, with a constant AL of 150 cm on long-term weight loss, remission of comorbidities, and supplementation needs after RYGB., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective randomized study of morbidly obese patients undergoing RYGB was performed. Patients were randomized into two groups: those patients undergoing RYGB with a BPL of 70 cm (BPL 70 cm) and those ones undergoing RYGB with a BPL of 120 cm (BPL 120 cm). BMI, excess BMI loss (EBMIL), remission of comorbidities and specific vitamin and mineral supplementation needs at 1, 2, and 5 years were analyzed., RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-three patients were included in each group. There were no significant differences in BMI, EBMIL and the remission of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia between groups at 1, 2, and 5 years after surgery. Patients from group BPL 120 cm required greater specific supplementation of vitamin B12, folic acid, and vitamin A during all the follow-up., CONCLUSION: A RYGB with 120 cm BPL does not achieve greater weight loss or remission of comorbidities than a RYGB with 70 cm BPL but is associated with greater deficiencies of vitamin B12, vitamin A, and folic acid., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03607305. https://clinicaltrials.gov/."

J. R. Salameh	Bariatric surgery: past and present	2006			"Bariatric operations are either restrictive, limiting the amount of food ingested; malabsorptive, limiting the amount of nutrient absorbed; or a combination of both. Bariatric surgery dates back to the 1950s when jejunoileal bypass was introduced. Since then, numerous improvements have been made in procedures and techniques. Currently, the two most common bariatric procedures performed are laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Both of these operations provide excellent results, with the majority of patients losing more than 50% of their excess weight and with most obesity-related comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension reversed or prevented. Morbidly obese patients considering such operations have to meet strict criteria and must be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team. They need to commit to long-term dietary changes, behavioral modifications, and medical supervision. The choice of procedure is guided by multiple factors, including the patient's and the surgeon's preference."

The trial enrolled 240 morbidly obese patients aged 18 to 60 years, who were randomly assigned to sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass with a 5-year follow-up period (last follow-up, October 14, 2015)., Interventions: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (n = 121) or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (n = 119)., Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was weight loss evaluated by percentage excess weight loss. Prespecified equivalence margins for the clinical significance of weight loss differences between gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy were -9% to +9% excess weight loss. Secondary end points included resolution of comorbidities, improvement of quality of life (QOL), all adverse events (overall morbidity), and mortality., Results: Among 240 patients randomized (mean age, 48 [SD, 9] years; mean baseline body mass index, 45.9, [SD, 6.0]; 69.6% women), 80.4% completed the 5-year follow-up.

Carpinteria, CA, USA). In this report, we present the safety, feasibility of the device, weight loss, and changes in comorbidities., METHODS AND PROCEDURES: A prospective, single-center, 12-month trial was designed. The patients are morbidly obese individuals who meet the NIH criteria for bariatric surgery. The GJBS is a 120-cm sleeve secured at the esophago-gastric junction with endoscopic and laparoscopic techniques that is designed to create an endoluminal gastro-duodeno-jejunal bypass. The device was implanted and, at the completion of the trial, retrieved with an endoscopic technique. The primary endpoints were safety and incidence of adverse events. The secondary outcomes included the percentage of excess weight loss (EWL) and changes in comorbidities, specifically glucose control, use of antihyperglycemics, and changes in hemoglobin A1C levels., RESULTS: From July 2009 until October 2009, 13 patients were prospectively enrolled for the 1-year trial. The study included five men and eight women with a mean preoperative BMI of 42 kg/m(2). One patient was excluded, at the time of endoscopic evaluation, due to inflammation at the GE junction. Two additional patients required early explantation of the device, within the first 4 weeks, due to patient intolerance. Upon explant of the device, both patients' symptoms improved. In the remaining ten patients, the device was implanted, left in situ for 12 months, and then retrieved endoscopically. Safe delivery of the cuff at the gastro-esophageal junction was seen in all ten patients whom had device implants, without complication. No esophageal leak was seen immediately post-procedure or during follow-up. The sleeve device was well tolerated within the bowel lumen during the 12-month study, specifically, no bowel erosions, ulceration, or pancreatitis was observed. All ten patients reached the 1-year mark. Of the ten, six had fully attached and functional devices throughout the follow-up, verified by endoscopy. The mean percentage EWL, at 1 year, in this group was 54 %. In the remaining four patients, partial cuff detachment was observed at follow-up endoscopy. The percentage EWL was lower in this group. Of the six patients that reached a year with a fully attached device, five were followed at an average of 14-months post-explant (26 months from the time of device implant). These five maintained an average percentage EWL of 30 % at the 14-month post-explant follow-up. Co-morbidites measured included diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and use of antihyperglycemics. Each of the measured comorbidities showed improvement during the 12-month trial., DISCUSSION: The endoluminal, GJBS can be safely placed and retrieved. The short-term data show it is well tolerated with a good safety profile. It achieves excellent weight loss results with over 70 % of all comorbidities resolved or significantly improved."

There is existing evidence suggesting bariatric surgery resolves or improves hypertension. The purpose of this study is to systematically review the effect of LSG on hypertension. An electronic search method was primarily used for identification of the studies. We performed a comprehensive search of all electronic databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Dare, Clinical Evidence, BIOSIS, Previews, TRIP, Web of Science, Health Technology Database, Conference abstracts, clinical trials, and the Cochrane Library database) using broad search terms. All human studies from August 2000 to September 2011 were included. After an initial screening, a total of 326 studies were identified. After assessment of these studies based on our exclusion criteria, 222 studies were considered for the abstract review. A total of 33 studies were identified after a careful screening, involving a total of 3,997 patients. The mean pre-operative body mass index (BMI) was 49.1 +/- 7.5 kg/m(2) (range 37-68). The average follow-up time was 16.9 +/- 9.8 months (range 12-48). The mean post-operative BMI was 36 +/- 7.0 kg/m(2) (range 25.6-54). LSG resulted in resolution of hypertension in 58% of patients. On average, 75% of patients experienced resolution or improvement of their hypertension. Based on our systematic review, LSG has a significant effect on hypertension, inducing resolution or improvement in the majority of cases. Therefore, LSG remains a viable surgical option in obese patients with hypertension."

Current conservative concepts regularly fail to reach therapeutic targets. Even though bariatric surgery has proven to be effective, it is not suitable for all patients. A less invasive approach for treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus is represented by the temporary endoscopic duodenal_jejunal bypass liner (DJBL). This device consists of a self_expanding ring armed with barbs which is endoscopically anchored in the duodenal bulb, and an adapted impermeable Teflon liner covering 60 cm of the proximal jejunal mucosal resorption area, thereby mimicking Roux_en_Y gastric bypass. Up to now, small prospective studies have demonstrated promising improvements of diabetes control and loss of bodyweight. However, longterm safety and efficacy have not been investigated in a sufficiently large cohort of patients. Collecting these data is the aim of a newly established DJBL registry. Materials and methods: Long term data were collected by approximately 30 centers. An electronic Case_Report_Form was designed for documentation of a pre_specified dataset.As ofOctober 2015, 201 patients had been included in the registry and first preliminary efficacy and safety data were obtained. Statistical analyses were performed by an independent statistician using t tests for continuous variables. Results: The mean age at baseline was 50.9 years. 74 out of 201 patients were male, baseline BMI was 42.8 kg/m2. Baseline HbA1C was 8.36%, and mean blood pressure 139/81 mmHg. 20.7% of patients were treated with GLP_1_analogs and 95.8% received insulin (mean insulin dose: 90.8 IU/day). In 114 patients data were available at time of im_ and explantation. A significant reduction was seen for weight, excess body weight, BMI, HbA1C, total cholesterol, LDL_cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure (_15 kg, _15.3 kg, _5.4 kg/m2, _1.47%, _28 mg/dl, _28 mg/dl and _6 mmHg, respectively). Mean insulin dose was reduced by 42.1 IU per day (all p<0.05). In addition a slight but not significant reduction was seen for diastolic blood pressure (3.3mmHg), triglycerides (41mg/dl). Moreover, a substantial proportion of patients who could reduce oral antihyperglycemic treatment (_33.7%), GLP_1_analogs (_56.5%), antihypertensive treatment (_14.6%), and lipid_lowering agents (_23.1%) was observed. In 31.8% of patients, side effects were documented: Abdominal pain was reported in 13.4%, nausea and vomiting in 8%, gastro_intestinal bleeding in 2%, and liver abscesses in 2%. Other side_effects were rare. Conclusion: The DJBL registry for the first time provides substantial evidence on the value of the DJBL as a potentially new antidiabetic_ and antiobesity_treatment in the largest cohort of diabetes patients investigated so far. Almost all patients are type 2 diabetic patients recieving high doses of insulin. Reductions in weight and HbA1C are beyond those previously published in clinical studies. Insulin doses were reduced by almost 50%. These data underline the importance of patient selection for DJBL treatment. However, side effects and long_term outcome of the DJBL need further investigation. We will present updated results and extended analyses supplemented by a prospective, 2:1_ matched_pair, observational analysis of patients with diabetes on intensive antihyperglycemic treatment."

METHODS: In this randomized, nonblinded, single_center trial, we evaluated the efficacy of intensive medical therapy alone versus medical therapy plus Roux_en_Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy in 150 obese patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes. The mean (±SD) age of the patients was 49±8 years, and 66% were women. The average glycated hemoglobin level was 9.2±1.5%. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with a glycated hemoglobin level of 6.0% or less 12 months after treatment. RESULTS: Of the 150 patients, 93% completed 12 months of follow_up. The proportion of patients with the primary end point was 12% (5 of 41 patients) in the medical_therapy group versus 42% (21 of 50 patients) in the gastric_bypass group (P=0.002) and 37% (18 of 49 patients) in the sleeve_gastrectomy group (P=0.008). Glycemic control improved in all three groups, with a mean glycated hemoglobin level of 7.5±1.8% in the medical_therapy group, 6.4±0.9% in the gastric_bypass group (P<0.001), and 6.6±1.0% in the sleeve_gastrectomy group (P=0.003). Weight loss was greater in the gastric_bypass group and sleeve_gastrectomy group (_29.4±9.0 kg and _25.1±8.5 kg, respectively) than in the medical_therapy group (_5.4±8.0 kg) (P<0.001 for both comparisons). The use of drugs to lower glucose, lipid, and blood_pressure levels decreased significantly after both surgical procedures but increased in patients receiving medical therapy only. The index for homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA_IR) improved significantly after bariatric surgery. Four patients underwent reoperation. There were no deaths or life_threatening complications. CONCLUSIONS: In obese patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, 12 months of medical therapy plus bariatric surgery achieved glycemic control in significantly more patients than medical therapy alone. Further study will be necessary to assess the durability of these results. (Funded by Ethicon Endo_Surgery and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00432809.)."
A. J. Scheen	Current management strategies for coexisting diabetes mellitus and obesity	2003			"Besides genetic predisposition, obesity is the most important risk factor for the development of diabetes mellitus. Weight reduction has been shown to markedly improve blood glucose control and vascular risk factors associated with insulin resistance in obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. Therapeutic strategies for the obese diabetic patient include: (i) promoting weight loss, through lifestyle modifications (low-calorie diet and exercise) and antiobesity drugs (orlistat, sibutramine, etc.); (ii) improving blood glucose control, through agents decreasing insulin resistance (metformin or thiazolidinediones, e.g. pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) or insulin needs (alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, e.g. acarbose) in preference to agents stimulating defective insulin secretion (sulphonylureas, meglitinide analogues); and (iii) treating common associated risk factors, such as arterial hypertension and dyslipidaemias, to improve cardiovascular prognosis. Whenever insulin is required by the obese diabetic patient after failure to respond to oral drugs, it should be preferably prescribed in combination with an oral agent, more particularly metformin or acarbose, or possibly a thiazolidinedione. When morbid obesity is present, both restoring a good glycaemic control and correcting associated risk factors can only be obtained through a marked and sustained weight loss. This objective justifies more aggressive weight reduction programmes, including very-low-calorie diets and bariatric surgery, but only within a multidisciplinary approach and long-term strategy."

Sjostrom and colleagues. This trial compared obese subjects who underwent gastric surgery and contemporaneously matched, conventionally treated obese control subjects. The follow-up rate for laboratory examinations was 74.5 percent at 10 years. At that time, data of 627 patients of the control group (mean age of 48 years, body mass index of 41 kg/m2) were compared to those of 641 patients who were submitted to surgery (banding n = 156, vertical banded gastroplasty n = 451 and gastric bypass n =34). At 10 years, the body weight had increased by 1.6 percent in the control group and decreased by 16.1 percent in the surgery group (p < 0.001), and similar changes were observed for waist circumference (+2.8 percent versus -10.1 percent, respectively, p < 0.001). Energy intake was lower and the proportion of physically active subjects higher in the surgery group than in the control group throughout the observation period. Ten-year rates of recovery from diabetes, hypertriglyceridaemia, low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, hypertension, and hyperuricaemia were more favourable in the surgery than in the control group. The surgery group had lower 10-year incidence rates of diabetes, hypertriglyceridaemia, and hyperuricaemia (but not of hypertension) than the control group. In conclusion, as compared with conventional therapy, bariatric surgery appears to be a valuable option for the treatment of severe obesity, resulting in long-term weight loss, improved lifestyle, and, except for hypercholesterolaemia that was not significantly affected, amelioration in cardiovascular risk factors that were elevated at baseline. Obtaining long-term data concerning the effect of weight loss on overall mortality and on the incidence rates of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cancer remains a key-objective of this landmark study."

In patients with obesity and OSAS scheduled for bariatric surgery (BS), guidelines recommend at least 4 weeks of preoperative continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Low-calorie ketogenic diets (LCKDs) promote pre-BS weight loss (WL) and improve HTN, DLP, and IR. However, it is unclear whether pre-BS LCKD with CPAP improves OSAS more than CPAP alone. We assessed the clinical advantage of pre-BS CPAP and LCKD in patients with obesity and OSAS. Seventy patients with obesity and OSAS were randomly assigned to CPAP or CPAP+LCKD groups for 4 weeks. The effect of each intervention on the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was the primary endpoint. WL, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, HTN, DLP, and IR were secondary endpoints. AHI scores improved significantly in both groups (CPAP, p=0.0231; CPAP+LCKD, p=0.0272). However, combining CPAP and LCKD registered no advantage on the AHI score (p=0.863). Furthermore, body weight, CRP levels, and systolic/diastolic blood pressure were significantly reduced in the CPAP+LCKD group after 4 weeks (p=0.0052, p=0.0161, p=0.0008, and p=0.0007 vs baseline, respectively), and CPAP+LCKD had a greater impact on CRP levels than CPAP alone (p=0.0329). The CPAP+LCKD group also registered a significant reduction in serum cholesterol, LDL, and triglyceride levels (p=0.0183, p=0.0198, and p<0.001, respectively). Combined with CPAP, LCKD-induced WL seems to not have a significant incremental effect on AHI, HTN, DLP, and IR but lower CRP levels demonstrated a positive impact on chronic inflammatory status.

The GATEWAY short and mid-term follow-up (1 and 3 years) showed significant improvements and remission of hypertension after bariatric surgery. Here, we present the 5-year follow up data from the GATEWAY trial. Method(s): We conducted a randomized (concealed), single center, phase III, parallel design, nonblinded clinical trial. Patients with grades 1 and 2 obesity, taking at least 2 antihypertensive drugs in full doses for HTN, had been randomly allocated to either Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) combined with medical therapy (MT) or MT (lifestyle/ nutritional advice) alone. The primary endpoint was reduction of at least 30% of the total antihypertensive drugs, while maintaining controlled blood pressure (BP) levels <140/90mmHg. Main analysis followed the modified intention-to-treat principle, and missing values were imputed with multiple imputation technique. Key secondary endpoints included various biomarkers. Result(s): A total of 100 patients were included (76% female, age: 43.8+/-9.2 years, body mass index, BMI: 36.9+/-2.7Kg/m2). At 5-years, BMI was 27.8+/-3.8kg/m2 for RYGB and 36.4+/-3.9kg/m2 for MT (p<0.001). 82.7% of RYGB patients achieved the primary endpoint at a significant higher rate, while 14.7% of patients acchieved it in MT group (rate ratio 5.6 [95% CI]: 2.8 to 11.1; p<0.001). Median (IQR) number of drugs was 1 (0-1) and 3 (3-4) for RYGB and MT, respectively. Rates of HTN remission were 46.4 and 2% for RYGB and MT, respectively (p<0.001). Sensitive analysis considering only completed follow-up cases (n=69) revealed consistent results. The differences between groups (RYGB-MT) at 60 months for glycated hemoglobin, insulin, triglycerides, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein levels were -0.62% (-0.88 to -0.35; p<0.001), -17.58mU/L (-21.91 to -13.24, p<0.001), -55.24mg/dL (-83.47 to -27.01, p<0.001), and -5.25mg/L (-8.89 to -1.61, p=0.005), respectively. Conclusion(s): Bariatric Surgery is an effective and durable strategy to control BP with less or none anti-hypertensive drugs and in improving metabolic and inflamatory profiles in patients with grades 1 and 2 obesity and hypertension."

OBJECTIVE(S): To determine the 3-year effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on blood pressure (BP) compared with medical therapy (MT) alone. DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01784848). SETTING: Investigator-initiated study at Heart Hospital (HCor), Sao Paulo, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with hypertension receiving at least 2 medications at maximum doses or more than 2 medications at moderate doses and with a body mass index (BMI) between 30.0 and 39.9 kg/m2 were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio). INTERVENTION: RYGB plus MT or MT alone. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was at least a 30% reduction in total number of antihypertensive medications while maintaining BP less than 140/90 mm Hg. Key secondary outcomes were number of antihypertensive medications, hypertension remission, and BP control according to current guidelines (<130/80 mm Hg). RESULT(S): Among 100 patients (76% female; mean BMI, 36.9 kg/m2 [SD, 2.7]), 88% from the RYGB group and 80% from the MT group completed follow-up. At 3 years, the primary outcome occurred in 73% of patients from the RYGB group compared with 11% of patients from the MT group (relative risk, 6.52 [95% CI, 2.50 to 17.03]; P < 0.001). Of the randomly assigned participants, 35% and 31% from the RYGB group and 2% and 0% from the MT group achieved BP less than 140/90 mm Hg and less than 130/80 mm Hg without medications, respectively. Median (interquartile range) number of medications in the RYGB and MT groups at 3 years was 1 (0 to 2) and 3 (2.8 to 4), respectively (P < 0.001). Total weight loss was 27.8% and -0.1% in the RYGB and MT groups, respectively. In the RYGB group, 13 patients developed hypovitaminosis B12 and 2 patients required reoperation.

Lifestyle changes and medical treatment for obesity have disappointing long-term results and albeit drugs for hypertension are usually very effective, the necessity of multiple pills and frequent side effects make the adherence to treatment a huge challenge for healthcare systems. Bariatric/metabolic surgery is a very effective treatment and an exponential number of studies have been showing its positive impact beyond weight loss, mainly on type 2 diabetes. There is also growing evidence suggesting that bariatric/metabolic surgery is associated with reduced incidence of cardiovascular events, but the impact on hypertension and other components of metabolic syndrome usually derive from trials' secondary end points. Taking this limitation in mind, bariatric/metabolic surgery action on blood pressure is reaching a significant proportion of hypertension resolution or improvement. In this review, we discussed the current evidence on the impact of bariatric/metabolic surgery on blood pressure control and pointed out perspectives in this research area."

Objectives: To evaluate if there is any correlation between the common limb (CL) length with hypertension remission rate, WL and other cardio_metabolic parameters in the GATEWAY TRIAL surgical patients. Methods: GATEWAY is a randomized trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of RYGB on hypertension improvement and other cardio_metabolic parameters in patients with grade 1 and 2 obesity compared to medical therapy. We randomized (1:1) a hundred patients and we analyzed 45 patients submitted to RYGB with 1 year of follow_up. We measured the entire bowel in all patients and used a 150cm alimentary limb (AL) and a 100cm biliopancreatic limb (BPL). Univariate logistic regression was used to analyze associations of CL length with hypertension remission. Pearson and Spearman correlation were used to evaluate the correlation between the CL length and the variance of weight loss, glycemic/A1c, HDL and LDL cholesterol and triglycerides levels. Results: 51% of the patients from the RYGB group showed hypertension remission (controlled blood pressure without medication). CL length was not significantly associated with hypertension remission (Figure)(odds ratio [95% CI] for 50 units increase in the CL: 0.97[0.68; 1.38], p =0.88).

In this study, we evaluated the impact of bariatric surgery on 24-hour BP profile, BP variability, and resistant hypertension prevalence. This is a randomized trial including obese patients with grade 1 and 2 using at least 2 antihypertensive drugs at maximal doses or >2 at moderate doses. Patients were allocated to either Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) combined with medical therapy or medical therapy alone for 12 months. The primary outcome was the 24-hour BP profile and variability (average real variability of daytime and night time BP). We evaluated the nondipping status and prevalence of resistant hypertension as secondary end points. We included 100 patients (76% female, body mass index, 36.9+/-2.7 kg/m2). The 24-hour BP profile (including nondipping status) was similar after 12 months, but the RYGB group required less antihypertensive classes as compared to the medical therapy alone (0 [0-1] versus 3 [2.5-4] classes; P<0.01). The average real variability of systolic nighttime BP was lower after RYGB as compared to medical therapy (between-group difference, -1.63; 95% CI, -2.91 to -0.36; P=0.01). Prevalence of resistant hypertension was similar at baseline (RYGB, 10% versus MT, 16%; P=0.38), but it was significantly lower in the RYGB at 12 months (0% versus 14.9%; P<0.001). In conclusion, RYGB significantly reduced antihypertensive medications while promoting similar 24-hour BP profile and nondipping status. Interestingly, bariatric surgery improved BP variability and may decrease the burden of resistant hypertension associated with obesity.

Method(s): This is a sub-analysis of a randomized clinical trial including hypertensive patients with grade 1 and 2 obesity, aged 18 to 65 years, using at least 2 drugs at optimal doses or >2 at moderate doses. Patients were randomly allocated to either Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) with medical therapy (MT) or MT alone for 12 months. We analyzed the 24-h BP profile, non-dipping status (defined by <10% of systolic BP reduction during sleep as compared to the daytime period) and RH incidence. Result(s): A total of 100 patients were included (76% female, age 43.8+/-9.2 years, BMI 36.9+/-2.7 Kg/m2). The 24-h BP profile was similar at 12 months in both groups, but the RYGB group required less anti-hypertensive classes compared to the MT alone (Figure). The rate of non-dipping BP did not change significantly during the follow-up (RYGB: from 18/48 (37.5%) to 22/48 (45.8%); p=0.30; MT: from 16/33 (48.5%) to 15/33 (45.5%); p=0.80). In an exploratory analysis, the incidence of RH was similar at the baseline (RYGB 10% (5/50) and MT 16% (8/50); p=0.38). After 12 months, it changed significantly in the RYGB group: 0% (0/49) while remained stable in the MT group: 14.9% (7/47) (p<0.001). Conclusion(s): RYGB significantly reduced anti-hypertensive medications while promoting similar 24-h BP profile and non-dipping BP status compared to the MT alone. RYGB may be an attractive strategy to reduce RH incidence in obese patients."

Study parameters were weight loss, changes in obesity_related comorbidities, long_term complications, re_operations including conversions to other bariatric procedures and laboratory parameters including vitamin status. From 91 patients (91%), data were obtained with a mean follow_up duration of 84 months (7 years). Weight loss [percent excess weight loss (EWL)] was significantly more after VBG compared with LAGB, 66% versus 54%, respectively. All comorbidities significantly decreased in both groups. Long_term complications after VBG were mainly staple line disruption (54%) and incisional hernia (27%). After LAGB, the most frequent complications were pouch dilatation (21%) and anterior slippage (17%). Major re_operations after VBG were performed in 60% of patients. All re_operations following were conversions to Roux_en_Y gastric bypass (RYGB). In the LAGB group, 33% of patients had a refixation or replacement of the band, and 11% underwent conversion to another bariatric procedure. There were no significant differences in weight loss between patients with or without re_interventions. No vitamin deficiencies were present after 7 years, although supplement usage was inconsistent. This long_term follow_up study confirms the high occurrence of late complications after restrictive bariatric surgery. The failure rate of 65% after VBG is too high, and this procedure is not performed anymore in our institution. The re_operation rate after LAGB is decreasing as a result of new techniques and materials. Results of the re_operations are good with sustained weight loss and reduction in comorbidities. However, in order to achieve these results, a durable and complete follow_up after restrictive procedures is imperative."

Rubino"	Metabolic surgery for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus	2009	https://dx.doi.org/10.4158/EP09170.RAR		"OBJECTIVE: To discuss the potential contribution of ""metabolic"" surgery in providing optimal management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)., METHODS: A literature search was performed with use of PubMed, and the clinical experience of the authors was also considered., RESULTS: Bariatric-or, more appropriately, metabolic-surgical procedures have been shown to provide dramatic improvement in blood glucose levels, blood pressure, and lipid control in obese patients with T2DM. In these patients, metabolic surgery involves a low risk of short-term mortality and a significant long-term survival advantage, whereas the diagnosis of diabetes is associated with significant long-term mortality. Experimental studies in animals and clinical trials suggest that gastrointestinal bypass procedures can control diabetes and associated metabolic alterations by mechanisms independent of weight loss. As a result, the use of bariatric surgery and experimental gastrointestinal manipulations to treat T2DM is increasing, even among less obese patients. Although body mass index (BMI) currently is the most important factor for identifying candidates for bariatric surgery, evidence shows that a specific cutoff BMI value cannot accurately predict successful surgical outcomes. Furthermore, BMI appears limited in defining the risk profile for patients with T2DM., CONCLUSION: Current BMI-based criteria for performance of bariatric surgery are not adequate for determining eligibility for operative treatment in patients with diabetes. Large clinical trials, comparing bariatric surgery versus optimal medical care of patients with T2DM, should be given priority in order to define the role of surgery in the management of diabetes. Recognizing the need to work as a multidisciplinary team that includes endocrinologists and surgeons is an initial step in addressing the issues and opportunities that surgery offers to diabetes care and research."

Recently, we showed that magnesium citrate supplementation results in a clinically relevant improvement of arterial stiffness. It remained unclear whether the observed effect was due to magnesium or citrate, and whether other magnesium compounds may have similar effects. Therefore, we aim to study the long_term effects of magnesium citrate, magnesium oxide and magnesium sulfate on arterial stiffness. In addition, we aim to investigate possible underlying mechanisms, including changes in blood pressure and changes in gut microbiota diversity. METHODS: In this randomized, double_blind, placebo_controlled trial, a total of 162 healthy overweight and slightly obese men and women will be recruited. During a 24_week intervention, individuals will be randomized to receive: magnesium citrate; magnesium oxide; magnesium sulfate (total daily dose of magnesium for each active treatment 450_mg); or placebo. The primary outcome of the study is arterial stiffness measured by the carotid_femoral pulse wave velocity (PWVc_f), which is the gold standard for quantifying arterial stiffness. Secondary outcomes are office blood pressure, measured by a continuous blood pressure monitoring device, and gut microbiota, measured in fecal samples. Measurements will be performed at baseline and at weeks 2, 12 and 24. DISCUSSION: The present study is expected to provide evidence for the effects of different available magnesium formulations (organic and inorganic) on well_established cardiovascular risk markers, including arterial stiffness and blood pressure, as well as on the human gut microbiota. As such, the study may contribute to the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in slightly obese, but otherwise healthy, individuals. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03632590 .

One anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) is rapidly emerging as a safe and effective metabolic procedure. This study aims at comparing the 1-year follow-up results of OAGB and LSG in terms of excess weight loss, complications, resolution of comorbidities, and quality of life. Method(s): A prospective randomized study of results between 100 LSG and 101 OAGB patients was done from 2012 to 2015. The results were compared regarding operative outcomes, percentage of excess weight loss, complications, resolution of comorbidities, and quality of life (BAROS score). Result(s): The mean BMI for the OAGB and LSG group was 44.31 and 43.75 kg/m2, respectively. Percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) for OAGB vs LSG was 66.87 +/- 10.87 vs 63.97 +/- 13.24 at 1 year (p > 0.05), respectively. Diabetes remission was 83.63 % in OAGB patients and 76.58 % in LSG patients. Remission of hypertension is 64.15 % in OAGB patients and 66.07 % in LSG patients. Bariatric Analysis Reporting and Outcome System (BAROS) was 3.71 in LSG and 3.96 in OAGB. Conclusion(s): In our study, there was no significant difference between LSG and OAGB in outcome at 1 year follow-up in % excess weight loss, remission of HTN, and quality of life. OAGB has marginally better outcome in T2 DM remission. However, a longer follow-up is required to establish a correct comparative result.Copyright © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Wilding	"Sleep-disordered breathing, type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome"	2014	https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1479972314552806		"Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) encompasses a spectrum of conditions that can lead to altered sleep homeostasis. In particular, obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is the most common form of SDB and is associated with adverse cardiometabolic manifestations including hypertension, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, ultimately increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. The pathophysiological basis of these associations may relate to repeated intermittent hypoxia and fragmented sleep episodes that characterize OSA which drive further mechanisms with adverse metabolic and cardiovascular consequences. The associations of OSA with type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome have been described in studies ranging from epidemiological and observational studies to controlled trials investigating the effects of OSA therapy with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). In recent years, there have been rising prevalence rates of diabetes and obesity worldwide. Given the established links between SDB (in particular OSA) with both conditions, understanding the potential influence of OSA on the components of the metabolic syndrome and diabetes and the underlying mechanisms by which such interactions may contribute to metabolic dysregulation are important in order to effectively and holistically manage patients with SDB, type 2 diabetes or the metabolic syndrome. In this article, we review the literature describing the associations, the possible underlying pathophysiological mechanisms linking these conditions and the effects of interventions including CPAP treatment and weight loss.Copyright © The Author(s) 2014."

Wilding	Obesity and Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome	2019	https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-46933-1_24		"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common condition that forms part of the spectrum of sleep disordered breathing (SDB). It may affect between 6 and 17% of all adults, but the risk rises with increasing body weight and it is very common in people with obesity. OSA causes symptoms of daytime sleepiness which can be disabling for patients, and this is currently the main criterion used to determine if treatment should be offered. Although obesity itself is associated with hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and dysglycaemia, emerging evidence shows that those with sleep apnoea are more likely to have all of these abnormalities at any given weight, and subsequently have a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease. OSA is particularly common in people with type 2 diabetes, affecting at least a quarter of patients, and is associated with a higher risk of developing microvascular complications such as retinopathy. The main treatment used for OSA is continuous positive airway pressure ventilation (CPAP), and this has been shown to reduce daytime sleepiness and lower blood pressure, but no prospective randomised controlled trials have shown reduction in CV risk or improvement in diabetes. Weight loss is also an effective treatment, and some patients can stop CPAP treatment after bariatric surgery.Copyright © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Severely obese patients have an increased risk of exercise-induced hypertension (EIH). We aimed to assess the blood pressure response to exercise in patients with severe obesity who underwent bariatric surgery as well as the main determinants of this response., METHODS: We used data from the ACTIVE clinical trial, in which 60 severely obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery were enrolled. Anthropometric measurements, abdominal and mid-thigh computed tomography scans and maximal exercise testing were performed before bariatric surgery, as well as 3 and 6 months post-surgery. EIH was defined as a maximal SBP >=210 mmHg for men and >=190 mmHg for women., RESULTS: At baseline, 62% of patients had EIH. At 6 months, we observed an EIH resolution rate of 39%. The main determinant of EIH resolution was sex. Actually, patients with EIH resolution were mostly women without resting hypertension and a lower amount of visceral adipose tissue., CONCLUSION: These results suggest that bariatric surgery is efficient to resolve EIH, particularly in women with initially a better anthropometric profile.

Metabolic surgery performed on patients with obesity grades II (BMI 35-40 kg/m(2)) and I (BMI 30-35 kg/m(2)) according to the World Health Organization (WHO) has increased in recent years; however, the indications for metabolic surgery in obesity grades I and II are currently under debate due to insufficient evidence. In the last 5 years several highly qualified randomized clinical trials have been published which evaluated the effect of metabolic surgery in patients with obesity grades I and II in comparison to conservative therapy. Based on these data the efficacy of metabolic surgery in short-term follow-up (12-36 months) is unquestionable when compared to conservative therapy according to the current guidelines. Besides improved glycemic control and remission of diabetes, metabolic surgery has the potential to have a positive influence on diabetic complications, such as diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy and polyneuropathy, as well as on comorbidities, such as arterial hypertension and dyslipidemia. Future clinical trials should address the long-term (> 36 months) effects of metabolic surgery, patient selection criteria and choice of procedure."

Studies in Caucasians show that Roux_en_Y gastric bypass (RYGB) promotes T2DM remission in most cases. Here we report 2_yr results of the first_ever RCT in Asian Indians of RYGB vs. Medical/Lifestyle Intervention (MLI) for T2DM, primarily in patients with BMI<35 kg/m2. Eighty patients with uncontrolled T2DM and BMI 25_40 kg/m2 were randomized to receive RYGB or MLI, and were studied at 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 mo. In each arm, 34 patients completed 2_yr follow up. Glycemic status, metabolic profiles, medicine use, body composition, IVGTTs, meal tests, microvascular complications, and quality of life were measured. Groups were equivalent at baseline for age, gender (54% male), diabetes duration (8.3±5.1 yr), HbA1c, fasting insulin and glucose, insulin use, BMI (31.1±3.5 kg/m2), waist circumference, body composition, blood pressure, and lipids. Maximum weight loss was 25.9% after RYGB vs. 4.4% with MLI (P<0.0001). Surgery patients lost more body fat and lean mass, with no differences in bone mineral content. Comparing surgery vs. MLI, respectively, 2 year results were: T2DM remission, 60 vs. 2.5% (P<0.0001, OR 59); glycemic control, 81 vs. 30% (P<0.0001); T2DM improvement, 100 vs. 73% (P=0.003); HbA1c reduction from 9.3 to 6.4% vs. 9.5 to 8.2% (P<0.0001 for within_ and between_group changes); and half as much diabetes medication use after RYGB. Results were similar in all baseline BMI tertiles. Fasting insulin was 5.2 times lower at 2 yr after RYGB vs. MLI (P<0.001). Systolic and diastolic BP fell throughout 2 years in both groups, but more after RYGB (P<0.0001 for both). HDL rose more with RYGB, but cholesterol fell more with MLI, and LDL was equal between groups. However, surgery patients used fewer lipid medicines. Throughout 2 years, RYGB yields far more T2DM remission, control, improvement, and reduction in other CVD risk factors than does MLI in South Asians with BMI 25_40 kg/m2."

Increasingly revisional bariatric surgery (RBS) is offered, most commonly either band to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (B-RYGB) or band to sleeve gastrectomy (B-SG)., OBJECTIVES: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies to evaluate the efficacy of RBS following failed LAGB., METHODS: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and NHS Evidence were searched for English language studies assessing patients who had undergone LAGB and who subsequently underwent either B-RYGB or B-SG., RESULTS: Thirty-six studies met the inclusion criteria. There were 2617 patients. B-RYGB was performed in 60.5% (n = 1583). There was one death within 30 days (0.0004%). The overall pooled morbidity rate was 13.2%. There was no difference between the B-RYGB and B-SG groups in morbidity, leak rate or return to theatre. Percentage excess weight loss (%EWL) following the revisional procedure for all patients combined at 6, 12 and 24 months was 44.5, 55.7 and 59.7%, respectively. There was no statistical difference in %EWL between B-RYGB and B-SG at any time point. The rates of remission of diabetes, hypertension and obstructive sleep apnoea were 46.5, 35.9 and 80.8%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) do not exist on this issue but the available observational evidence does suggest that RBS is associated with generally good outcomes similar to those experienced after primary surgery. Further, high-quality research, particularly RCTs, is required to assess long-term weight loss, comorbidity and quality of life outcomes."

Last observation carried forward was used in the analyses of change in body weight and comorbid conditions, and observed data were analyzed for the Obesity and Weight-Loss Quality of Life (OWLQOL) questionnaire. Changes in body weight, percent weight loss, percent excess weight loss, body mass index (BMI), OWLQOL score, remission or improvement in obesity-related comorbid conditions, and adverse events were reported., RESULTS: At baseline, 81.5% of patients were female, and 85.8% were white. The mean age was 42.5 years, and the mean BMI was 44.0 kg/m(2). More than 85% of patients had >= 1 obesity-related comorbidity. At 2 years, the mean BMI change was -8.5 kg/m(2), and the mean percent weight loss was -19.3%.

Chen"	Bariatric surgery in women of reproductive age: special concerns for pregnancy	2008			"CONTEXT: The use of bariatric surgery for treating severe obesity has increased dramatically over the past 10 years; about half of patients who undergo these procedures are women of reproductive age. This report was commissioned to measure the incidence of bariatric surgery in this population and review the evidence on the impact of bariatric surgery on fertility and subsequent pregnancy., OBJECTIVES: To measure the incidence of contemporary bariatric surgery procedures in women age 18-45 and to assess its impact on fertility, contraception, prepregnancy risk factors, and pregnancy outcomes, including those of neonates., DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), a national sample of over 1,000 hospitals, to measure the trend in the number of women of reproductive age who underwent bariatric procedures from 1998-2005. We searched numerous electronic databases, including MEDLINE and Embase, for potentially relevant studies involving bariatric surgery (gastric bypass, laparoscopic adjustable gastric band, vertical-banded gastroplasty, biliopancreatic diversion), and consequent fertility, contraception, pregnancy, weight management, maternal and neonatal outcomes, and nutritional deficiencies. We scanned reference lists for additional relevant articles and contacted experts in the fields of bariatric surgery and obstetrics/gynecology (OB/GYN). Of 223 screened articles, we accepted 57 that reported on fertility following surgery (19 articles), contraception use/recommendations (11), maternal weight or nutrition management (28), maternal outcomes including morbidity and mortality (48), cesarean-section rates (16), and neonatal outcomes (44). These articles included reports on gastric bypass, both open and laparoscopic (27 articles), laparoscopic adjustable band (15), biliopancreatic diversion (16), and vertical-banded gastroplasty (6). Studies could contribute to one or more analyses. We found one case-control study and the observational data accepted included 12 cohort studies, 21 case series, and 23 individual case reports., DATA EXTRACTION: We abstracted information about study design, fertility history, fertility outcomes, prepregnancy weight loss, nutritional management, outcomes following pregnancy, and adverse events (during pregnancy) related to surgery., DATA SYNTHESIS: Nationally representative data showed a six-fold increase in bariatric surgery inpatient procedures from 1998 to 2005. Women age 18-45 accounted for about half of the patients undergoing bariatric surgery; over 50,000 have these procedures as inpatients annually. An unknown number have outpatient bariatric procedures. We identified one case-control study that directly addressed some of the key questions, but no randomized controlled trials or prospective cohort studies, which would be the strongest study designs to answer questions about effectiveness, risk and prognosis. Consequently, all of our conclusions are limited by the available data, and are cautious. The evidence suggests that bariatric surgery results in improved fertility; the strongest evidence is in women with the polycystic ovarian syndrome, where biochemical studies showing normalization of hormones after surgery support case series data. Observational studies (retrospective cohorts and case series) suggest that fertility improves following bariatric procedures and weight loss; similar to that seen when obese women lose weight through nonsurgical means. There is almost no evidence on post-surgical contraceptive efficacy or use. Research is needed to determine whether differences in absorption, particularly for oral contraceptives, affect contraceptive efficacy. Nutrient deficiencies were reported in infants born to women who underwent procedures that resulted in malabsorption, as well as women who did not take prenatal vitamins or had difficulty with their own nutrition (i.e., from chronic vomiting). Literature suggests that gastric bypass and laparoscopic adjustable band procedures confer only minimal, if any, increased risk of nutritional or congenital problems if supplemental vitamins are taken and maternal nutrition is otherwise adequate. Biliopancreatic diversion has an appreciable risk for nutritional problems in some patients. Women who have undergone bariatric surgery may have less risk than obese women for certain pregnancy complications such as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and pregnancy induced hypertension. There is no evidence that cesarean section rates and delivery complications are higher in the post-surgery group, but data are limited., CONCLUSIONS: Weight loss procedures are being performed more frequently to treat morbid obesity, with a six-fold increase over a recent 7-year time span; almost half of all patients are women of reproductive age. The level of evidence on fertility, contraception, and pregnancy outcomes is limited to observational studies. Data suggest that fertility improves after bariatric surgical procedures, nutritional deficiencies for mother and child are minimal, and maternal and neonatal outcomes are acceptable with laparoscopic adjustable band and gastric bypass as long as adequate maternal nutrition and vitamin supplementation are maintained. There is no evidence that delivery complications are higher in post-surgery pregnancies."

The objective of this study was to describe the surgical technique of LGCP and validate the efficacy and safety of LGCP for the treatment of obesity in obese Chinese patients with a relatively low body mass index (BMI)., METHODS: Twenty-two obese patients (mean age 33.8+/-6.0 years; mean BMI 37.0+/-7.0 kg/m(2)) underwent LGCP between September 2011 and September 2012. After dissecting the greater omentum and short gastric vessels, the gastric greater curvature plication with 2 rows of nonabsorbable suture was performed under the guidance of a 32-F bougie. The data were collected during follow-up examinations performed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively., RESULTS: All procedures were performed laparoscopically. The mean operative time was 84.1 minutes (50-120 min), and the mean length of hospital stay was 3.8 days (2-10 d). There were no deaths or postoperative major complications that needed reoperation. The mean percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) was 22.9%+/-6.9%, 38.6%+/-9.8%, 51.5%+/-13.5%, and 61.1%+/-15.9% at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. At 6 months, type 2 diabetes was in remission in 2 (50%) patients, hypertension in 1 (33.3%) patient, and dyslipidemia in 11 (78.6%) patients. Decreases in the index for homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and in insulin and glucose concentrations were observed., CONCLUSIONS: The early outcomes of LGCP as a novel treatment for obese Chinese with a relatively low BMI are satisfactory with respect to the effectiveness and low incidence of major complications. Additional long-term follow-up and prospective, comparative trials are still needed.

The mean operative time was 95.0 +/- 17.4 minutes for the LGCP group and 85.5 +/- 18.4 minutes for the LSG group (P = 0.107). No patient required reoperation due to an early complication. One patient in the LSG group was readmitted because of gastric stenosis. The mean hospital stay was 4.2 +/- 1.9 days in the LGCP group and 3.9 +/- 1.7 days in the LSG group (P = 0.595). The total cost of LSG was $7,826 +/- 537 compared to LGCP ($3,358 +/- 264) (P < 0.001). One year after surgery, the mean %EWL was 58.8 +/- 16.7 % (n = 11) in the LGCP group and 80.0 +/- 26.8 % (n = 11) in the LSG group (P = 0.038). Loss of feeling of hunger was reported in 27.3 % LGCP patients and 72.7 % LSG patients (P = 0.033) at 1 year after surgery. The comorbidities, including diabetes, sleep apnea and hypertension, were markedly improved in both groups 6 months after surgery., CONCLUSIONS: The short-term outcomes of our study demonstrate that compared with LSG, LGCP is inferior as a restrictive procedure for weight loss, despite its significantly smaller cost. Longer follow-up and prospective comparative trials are needed to confirm the long-term outcomes of this novel procedure and make definitive conclusions."

Material(s) and Method(s): A prospective randomised study of results between 100 LSG patients and 101 MGB-OAGB patients was done from 2012 to 2015. The results were compared regarding operative outcomes, percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL), complications, resolution of comorbidities and quality of life (BAROS score) at 3 years follow-up. Result(s): Follow-up was achieved in 93 MGB-OAGB vs 92 LSG patients for 3-year period. The average %EWL for MGB-OAGB vs LSG was 66.48 vs 61.15% at the end of 3 years respectively, which was statistically insignificant. Diabetes remission was seen in 89.13% of MGB-OAGB patients and 81.82% of LSG patients. Remission of hypertension was seen in 74% of MGB-OAGB patients and 72.22% of LSG patients. Bariatric analysis reporting and outcome system (BAROS) with comorbidity in LSG patients and MGB-OAGB patients was 6.03 and 6.96 respectively, whereas in patients without comorbidity, BAROS score was 3.86 in LSG group and 4.34 in MGB-OAGB group. Conclusion(s): In our study, at 36 months follow up, there was no significant difference between LSG and MGB-OAGB in %EWL and remission of HTN. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remission rates were higher after MGB-OAGB as compared to LSG but the difference was statistically insignificant. MGB-OAGB patients with comorbidities have a better quality of life and BAROS score compared to LSG patients.Copyright © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
R. Shoenfeld	Pre-emptive dilation of stenoses in dialysis access: con	2015	10.1007/s00270-015-1173-5	CN-01106757	"AV access failure most often results from multiple factors culminating in neointimal hyperplasia, vessel stenosis, and eventually thrombosis. These events predominate in the juxta_anastomotic segment in AV fistulae (AVF) and at the venous anastomosis in AV grafts (AVG). Certain factors such as surgical anastomotic configuration and wall shear stress (WSS)1 have been shown to cause endothelial dysfunction, leading to activation and intimal migration of fibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle cells, and proliferation of microvessels2. Other implicated causes include chronic kidney disease_mediated vasculopathy3, inadequate outward remodelling and compliance mismatch due to vessel wall stiffness in synthetic AV grafts, and increased arterial stiffness in diabetes mellitus. On a molecular level, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation may be initiated by growth factors (PDGF_BB), hormones, or other stimuli such as uremia, oxidative stress, tissue injury, inflammation, cytokines, and certain drugs. Via various pathways, they influence production of transcription factors (non_coding microRNAs [miRs]) that direct gene activity. These miRs help downregulate gene expression through translational repression or degradation of target mRNA (autophagy), causing phenotype switching of vascular smooth muscle cells from contractile to synthetic. This results in increased proliferation, migration, matrix secretion, and microvessel proliferation. Although our knowledge of the molecular processes driving neointimal hyperplasia is rapidly expanding, many questions remain to be answered with respect to mechanisms of action, particularly in veins. AVFs have a much higher reported primary failure rate than AVGs due to non_maturation4. Once mature, AVFs require fewer interventions than AVGs to maintain similar cumulative patency. Early surgical or endovascular intervention may result in salvage of immature AVFs with acceptable post_intervention primary patency (PIPP) and access circuit primary patency (ACPP). However, there is a paucity of published level I data on cumulative patency following pre_emptive dilatation. In a non_randomized study, Timmy Lee et al. reported cumulative AVF survival of 68% vs.78% vs. 92%, respectively, at 1 year following 2 vs.1 vs. 0 interventions prior to achieving maturation. At 2 years, AVF survival was 57% vs.71% vs.85%, respectively, and at 3 years, AVF survival was 42% vs. 57% vs. 75%, respectively. Frequency of intervention to maintain patency after maturation was 3.51 ± 2.2 vs.1.37 ± 0.31 vs.0.76 ± 0.10, respectively, per year. They concluded that AVFs requiring intervention to maintain patency had decreased cumulative survival compared with those that spontaneously matured5. The rationale for pre_emptive dilatation of stenoses in dialysis access follows KDOQI surveillance guidelines6. AVFs with access dysfunction and/or access blood flow (Qa) < 400_500 ml/min and AVGs with either Qa ² 600 ml/min or Qa < 1000 ml/min with a decrease of >25% should be referred for stenosis imaging and treatment. In a randomized trial, Tessitore et al. reported that elective stenosis revision in functional AVFs with Qa > 350 ml/min resulted in a fourfold reduction in risk of access loss compared with intervention in dysfunctional AVFs7. Vascular access screening also detects subclinical and significant stenoses (>50%) in properly functioning AVFs with Qa ³ 500 ml/min. These AVFs can deliver adequate dialysis with a low risk of failure8. No intervention is warranted in such cases since the stenosis is not hemodynamically significant (i.e., poor clearance, prolonged bleeding, difficult cannulation, and >50% stenosis, with a trending change in access flow or pressure). Treatment may be harmful since unnecessary angioplasty (PTA) for stable or slow_growing stenoses may impair access survival by prompting aggressive restenosis due to accelerated neointimal hyperplasia9. AV access surveillance and pre_emptive treatment of severe stenosis have been reported to reduce the incidence of thrombosis. Howev r, randomized controlled trials failed to confirm improved long_term AV access survival. In a systematic review and analysis, Tonelli et al.10 reported no conclusive evidence that screening with access flow measurements prevented access loss in fistulas or grafts nor did pre_emptive angioplasty result in improved quality of life or conserved resources. Moreover, randomized controlled trials did not demonstrate benefit of surveillance in grafts. In a randomized trial to test the hypothesis that pre_emptive treatment of AVGs reduces thrombosis rates and increases access survival compared with treatment only at time of dysfunction or thrombosis, Dember et al.11 randomized 64 patients to 2 study arms (observation and pre_emptive treatment). Monthly static venous pressure/ systolic pressure ratios (SVPR) were obtained. Values ³ 0.4 triggered pre_emptive intervention in the treatment group, whereas patients in the observation group only underwent study and treatment for access dysfunction or thrombosis. During the 3.5_year study period, the proportion of patients with a thrombotic event was significantly greater in the observation group. However, both groups showed similar thrombosis rates, identical access abandonment (14 patients/ group), and no statistical difference in time to access abandonment. In a sequential observational trial, Shahin et al.12 compared historical controls (physical exam) with physical exam plus monthly access flow monitoring (ultrasound dilution technique). The addition of access flow monitoring resulted in a sevenfold increase in angioplasty procedures (0.67 vs. 0.09 per access_year). Angioplasty effectively restored flow to original baseline, with no improvement in thrombosis rate or cumulative patency. Primary assisted patency decreased due to the increased rate of angioplasty. In their report on interim analysis of a randomized controlled trial, Tessitore et al. confirmed that treating asymptomatic stenoses could trigger aggressive stenosis, leading to thrombosis13. Another potential concern was the generation of high Qa (>2000 ml/min) leading to high_output heart failure14. Paclitaxel_coated balloons employed after successful conventional or high_pressure angioplasty retard neointimal hyperplasia and stenosis in AVFs and possibly in AVGs. Their mechanism of action involves stabilization of nuclear microtubules causing tubular overload of cells and arrest of cell division at the G2/M checkpoint, thus preventing cytokinesis. Three significantly flawed trials reported results with paclitaxel_coated balloons in treating AVF and AVG stenosis in 51 patients15,16,17. Sixmonth primary patency ranged from 70% to 92.3%. Two of the studies reported 12_month patency of 90.9% and 20%16,17. One study reported 24_month patency of 57.8%16. These results suggest a short_term advantage of paclitaxel_coated balloons over conventional balloons in retarding neointimal hyperplasia. Patane et al.'s unusually good longterm results were outliers without a control group for comparison. Perhaps most importantly, the concept of pre_emptive treatment of AV access stenosis is misguided, based on the idea that repeatedly dilating a stenosis with a balloon will somehow correct abnormalities of wall shear stress, vascular remodeling, compliance mismatch, and suboptimal anastomotic angles/configuration to favorably improve long_term access viability. Instead, we must recognize that stenosis is the macro_manifestation of molecular response to vessel injury and endothelial dysfunction. The ultimate solution will reside in our understanding of vessel wall molecular biology and our use of genetic tools to influence or control the factors that upregulate and downregulate the genetic response to injury."

Shrivastava	Impact of sleep-disordered breathing treatment on upper airway anatomy and physiology	2014	https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2014.01.002		"Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is a major public health problem. Various anatomic, pathophysiologic, and environmental changes contribute to SDB. The successful treatment of SDB reverses many of these abnormal processes. The present article discusses the current clinical evidence that supports the reversibility and its potential application in the management of SDB. Continuous positive airway pressure reduces angiogenesis and inflammatory edema, increases pharyngeal size, and improves surrogate markers of vascular inflammation and tongue muscle fiber types. Mandibular advancement devices lead to favorable maxillary and mandibular changes, increase pharyngeal area, and improve hypertension. Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty increases posterior airway space and pharyngeal volume, reduces nasal and oral resistance, and lowers response to high CO2. Weight loss reduces nasopharyngeal collapsibility, critical closing pressure of the airway, apnea-hypopnea index, and improves oxygen saturations. Potential clinical benefits of these changes in the management of SDB and patient compliance with treatment are discussed. © 2014 Elsevier B.V."

The aim of this study was to compare the effect of SG, RYGB, and OAGB, on short-and long-term weight loss and comorbidities resolution. Method(s): A prospective non randomized clinical study of all morbidly obese patients undergoing SG, RYGB, and MGB, as primary bariatric procedures, was performed. Patients were randomly assigned into 3 groups as per their choice after explaning all procedures. BMI, excess BMI loss (EBMIL) and remission of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), hypertension (HT), and dyslipidemia (DL) were assessed. Result(s): 150 patients were included in the study, 50 in each group. First 50 of each procedure were taken after the start date.Follow-up rate at 3 years postoperatively was 91% in SG group, 92% in RYGB, and 90% in MGB.MGB achieves significantly greater EBMIL than RYGB and SG at 1, 2, and 3 years (p < 0.001, respectively). At years, MGB achieves significantly greater remission of T2DM (p = 0.027), HT (p = 0.006), and DL (p < 0.001) than RYGB and SG. RYGB did not show significant superiority than SG in short-and long-term remission of T2DM and HT, but achieves greater remission of DL (p < 0.001). Conclusion(s):MGB achieves superior mid-and long-term weight loss than RYGB and SG. There are no significant differences in weight loss between SG and RYGB at 1, 2, and 3 years.MGB achieves better short-and long-term resolution rates of DM, HT, and DL than SG and RYGB. RYGB reaches significantly greater rates of T2DM & DL remission than SG."

At 1 yr, weight loss after LAGB was greater than IMWM (_13.5 ± 1.3 vs. _8.4 ± 1.2 kg, respectively, p < 0.01), and this difference continued through 3 yrs (_12.0 ± 2.0 vs. _4.8 ± 2.0 kg, p < 0.01). Reductions in HbA1c were initially similar in the two groups (_1.2 ± 0.3 vs. _1.0 ± 0.3% at 1 yr), but LAGB produced a sustained reduction at 3 yrs (_0.8 ± 0.4%, p < 0.05 vs. baseline) vs. IMWM (+0.2 ± 0.4%, p = NS). HDL cholesterol increased more at all times after surgical vs. medical therapy (+10.0 ± 1.7 vs. +2.6 ± 2.7 mg/dl at 3 yrs, p < 0.01), while triglycerides improved similarly in both groups (_33 ± 16 vs. _20 ± 15 mg/dl).

A. K. Singh and S. K. Kota	Bariatric surgery and diabetes remission: How far have we progressed?	2015	https://dx.doi.org/10.1586/17446651.2015.1073586		"Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus have been associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Bariatric surgery results in substantial and sustained weight loss in morbidly obese patients and improves obstructive sleep apnea. Furthermore, bariatric surgery improves diabetes control, hypertension, quality of life, stroke, myocardial infarction and reduces mortality. Interestingly, bariatric surgery induces high rates of short and long-term diabetes remission. While the exact mechanisms behind this are not completely understood, improved insulin action, beta-cell function and a complex interplay of hormones in the entero-insular axis appear to play major roles. Insulin action improves proportionally to weight loss and it gets completely normalized especially after bilio-pancreatic diversion. beta-Cell function also seems to improve after a variety of bariatric surgeries. Seemingly, baseline beta-cell function is able to predict future diabetes remission. This article will review the effectiveness of bariatric procedures on the remission and improvement of diabetes and its implicated mechanisms.Copyright © 2015 Informa UK, Ltd."

Du"	A randomized study of meloxicam IV following laparoscopic abdominal surgery	2018	10.1080/00325481.2018.1512253	CN-01646774	"Purpose Intravenous (IV) meloxicam (Meloxicam IV) is a novel formulation of NanoCrystal Colloidal Dispersion¨ meloxicam, being developed for the management of moderate to severe pain. Postoperative pain after laparoscopic surgery is a major concern of patients, and improper pain management can be associated with varied respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and psychological complications. Pain after laparoscopic surgery may be transient or persistent and opioids have traditionally been the mainstay treatment for postoperative pain. Increasing evidence exists to support use of multimodal treatment approachs for postoperative pain that may reduce opioid side effects and improve pain intensity scores. The reported randomized controlled Phase 2 study was undertaken to evaluate meloxicam IV for the management of pain following laparoscopic abdominal surgeries. Methods This was a Phase 2, randomized, double_blind, placebo and active controlled study in subjects undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgery. Allowed procedures included biliary tree surgery, common bile duct exploration/surgery, cholecystectomy, and inguinal hernia surgery. This study was conducted under an FDA IND, IRB approval was obtained prior to study conduct and all subjects provided written informed consent. Subjects were randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to IV doses of placebo, ketorolac IV 30 mg every 6 hours (Q6H), meloxicam IV 7.5 mg every 12 hours (Q12H), meloxicam IV 15 mg Q12H, or meloxicam IV 30 mg once daily (QD) for up to 48 hours; placebo doses were administered Q6H as appropriate to maintain blinding. Following surgery, subjects who experienced moderate to severe pain were treated with study drug, and underwent safety and efficacy assessments throughout a 48_hour inpatient period. Efficacy was evaluated using pre_and post_dose pain intensity assessments (100 mm visual analog scale) and rescue analgesia use. Safety was monitored through the reporting of adverse events, clinical laboratory testing, vital sign assessments, 12_lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), and wound site assessments. The study was planned to enroll 200 evaluable subjects; however, the study was terminated for business reasons after 50 subjects were enrolled. Due to the early termination of the study, efficacy data were not formally analyzed for the study report, but adhoc analysis of efficacy data were subsequently performed. Results A total of 50 subjects were randomized and received at least one dose of study drug. Mean pain intensity differences from baseline over the 48_hour assessment period were similar between the meloxicam IV 15 mg Q12H and 30 mg QD groups, and demonstrated reductions in pain comparable to those seen in the ketorolac IV 30 mg Q6H group. The most common treatment_emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported across the meloxicam groups included headache, dry mouth, dysuria, and nausea; these events were reported at rates similar to placebo. Most TEAEs were mild in intensity and unrelated to treatment. No deaths were reported. One ketorolac_treated subject who underwent hernia repair had a serious adverse event of post procedural hemorrhage. One meloxicam IV 7.5 mg Q12H treated subject had a TEAE of mild truncal maculopapular rash that lead to discontinuation; this subject had no signs of anaphylaxis. The mean changes from baseline in laboratory parameters were small and similar across treatment groups. Mean blood pressure tended to decrease in all groups following treatment, while heart rate and ECG parameters were virtually unchanged. Wound examinations showed normal healing in the meloxicam and ketorolac groups. Conclusions Meloxicam IV was generally well tolerated in this study with a safety profile comparable to placebo. Pain intensity differences over time suggest meloxicam IV 15 mg Q12H, meloxicam IV 30 mg QD, and ketorolac 30 mg IV Q6H provided pain relief after laparoscopic abdominal surgery."

The goal of the current study is to explore the role of surgery in patients with moderate obesity or body mass index (BMI)<35. Method(s): Systematic review and Meta analysis was performed focusing solely on patients with BMI<35 who underwent laparoscopic Roux en Y gastric bypass (REYGB), sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), or adjustable gastric banding (AGB). Data were limited to randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies. Primary outcome measure was fasting plasma glucose (FPG). Secondary outcome measures included hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and other obesity related comorbidities. Result(s): 13 studies were included in the analysis. Surgery was associated with significantly improved FPG compared to medical therapy (WMD -3.24, 95% CI -4.45; -2.02). Surgery was also associated with improved HbA1c, body weight, BMI loss, waist circumference, and resolution of hypertension and dyslipidemia. Improvements were also seen with respect to obstructive sleep apnea, osteoarthritis, gastroesophageal reflux, infertility, urinary stress incontinence, and venous stasis. These results were consistent across each surgical procedure. 2 randomized controlled trials compared REYGB to LSG and subgroup analysis was performed which revealed no difference with respect to glucose metabolism however REYGB was associated with greater BMI loss and decreased waist circumference. Perioperative complications were comparable to morbidly obese subjects. Conclusion(s): REYGB, LSG and AGB appear to be safe and effective in the treatment of obesity and related comorbidities in patients with BMI<35. REYGB and LSG have similar effects on FPG and HbA1c however REYGB appears to have improved results with respect to waist circumference and BMI."

Recent studies proposed bariatric surgery for treating diabetes in case of obesity class I (BMI 30_35kg/m2). The first choice is the gastric bypass, however, sleeve with ileal transposition is a new technique proposed, but not yet approved, that changes the insulin secretion and resistance without causing major changes in weight and nutritional deficiencies. In this randomized, nonblinded, single_center trial, to evaluate the effectiveness on glycemic control, diabetes remission, security and weight control we evaluated three treatment arms: clinical, gastric bypass and sleeve with ileal transposition (sleeve_IT); in 42 obese class I patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes. Patients' average age (±SD) was 51±7 years old, and 62% were women. The average glycated hemoglobin level was 9.3±1.9%. Glycemic control was defined as glycated hemoglobin level of 6.5% or less, that was achieved in 8% (1 of 12 patients) in clinical group versus 46% (6 of 13 patients) in the bypass group and 100% (12 of 12 patients) in the sleeve_ TI group (p= 0,002 sleeve vs bypass). Diabetes remission was defined as glycemic control without medication and was achieved in 30% (4 of 13 patients) in the bypass group versus 75% (9 of 12 patients) in sleeve_TI group (p=0,02 sleeve vs bypass). Glycemic control improved in all three groups, with an average glycated hemoglobin level of 8±1.3% in the clinical group, 6.9±1.0% in the bypass group and 5,6±0,6% in the sleeve_TI group (p=0,01 sleeve vs bypass). Weight loss was greater in the bypass and sleeve_TI (_22.5± 8,2kg and _18±6,4 kg, respectively) than in the clinical group (_4,7±5,1 kg) (p=0.003 for bypass and p=0,017 for sleeve_TI versus clinical group). Drugs to lower glucose, lipid, and blood_pressure levels decreased after both surgical groups. Four patients experienced serious adverse event. There were no deaths or life_threatening complications. Although it has been recommended in 2010, by International Diabetes Federation, surgery in diabetic patients with BMI between 30_35 when clinical treatment is not successful, few studies have been published. This study showed that the sleeve_TI surgery has better results in glycemic control than the clinical and bypass treatment. The protocol follow_up will continue for 24 to 36 months to assess the maintenance of the results (NCT01857076)."

As BMI increases, the likelihood of anovulation is higher. The primary aim of the EMOVAR clinical trial is to examine, over the short (16 weeks) and medium (12 months) term, the effects of a supervised physical exercise program (focused primarily on aerobic and resistance training) on ovarian function in women with severe/morbid obesity who have undergone bariatric surgery. Secondary objectives are to examine the effects of the intervention on chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, arterial stiffness, physical fitness, and health-related quality of life., METHODS: This is a randomized controlled trial in which ~40 female bariatric surgery patients, aged between 18 and 45 years old, will be included. Participants assigned to the experimental group will perform a total of 48 sessions of supervised concurrent (strength and aerobic) training (3 sessions/week, 60 min/session) spread over 16 weeks. Patients assigned to the control group will receive lifestyle recommendations. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, week 16 (i.e., after the exercise intervention) and 12 months after surgery. The primary outcome is ovarian function using the Sex-Hormone Binding Globuline, measured in serum. Secondary outcomes are serum levels of anti-mullerian hormone, TSH, T4, FSH, LH, estradiol, prolactine, and free androgen index, as well as oocyte count, the diameters of both ovaries, endometrial thickness, and uterine arterial pulsatility index (obtained from a transvaginal ultrasound), the duration of menstrual bleeding and menstrual cycle duration (obtained by personal interview) and hirsutism (Ferriman Gallwey Scale). Other secondary outcomes include serum markers of chronic inflammation and insulin resistance (i.e., C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, leptin, glomerular sedimentation rate, glucose, insulin and the HOMA-IR), arterial stiffness, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure, body composition, and total weight loss. Physical fitness (including cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength, and flexibility), health-related quality of life (SF-36 v2) and sexual function (Female Sexual Function Index) will also be measured., DISCUSSION: This study will provide, for the first time, relevant information on the effects of exercise training on ovarian function and underlying mechanisms in severe/morbid obese women following bariatric surgery., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN27697878)."

Inclusion criteria included RCT with follow-up >= 12 months., RESULTS: A total of 842 articles were identified, 95 of them contained information on the effect of WL on biological markers. Twenty studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. WL percentage ranged from 0.8 to 20%. A reduction of A1C was observed in nine studies, blood glucose in seven, of total cholesterol and LDL in four, systolic and diastolic blood pressure in three, and the use of hypoglycemic drugs in four; an increase of HDL was observed in seven studies. Remission of T2DM was reported in only one study, which included surgical treatment. The quality of the studies ranged from very low to high; however, the study with the longest follow-up that did not involve surgical treatment, was 52 months., CONCLUSION: The evidence of the beneficial effect of WL on biological markers on long-term studies in people with T2DM is inconclusive. These results warrant longer and better designed studies."

Uncontrolled studies suggest that duodenal switch induces greater weight loss than gastric bypass., OBJECTIVE: To determine whether duodenal switch leads to greater weight loss and more favorable improvements in cardiovascular risk factors and quality of life than gastric bypass., DESIGN: Randomized, parallel-group trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00327912), SETTING: 2 academic medical centers (1 in Norway and 1 in Sweden)., PATIENTS: 60 participants with a body mass index (BMI) between 50 and 60 kg/m(2)., INTERVENTION: Gastric bypass (n = 31) or duodenal switch (n = 29)., MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the change in BMI after 2 years. Secondary outcomes included anthropometric measures; concentrations of blood lipids, glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein, and vitamins; and health-related quality of life and adverse events., RESULTS: Fifty-eight of 60 participants (97%) completed the study. The mean reductions in BMI were 17.3 kg/m(2) (95% CI, 15.7 to 19.0 kg/m(2)) after gastric bypass and 24.8 kg/m(2) (CI, 23.0 to 26.5 kg/m(2)) after duodenal switch (mean between-group difference, 7.44 kg/m(2) [CI, 5.24 to 9.64 kg/m(2)]; P < 0.001).

Reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration, anthropometric measures, fat mass, and fat-free mass were also greater after duodenal switch (P <= 0.010 for each between-group comparison). Both groups had reductions in blood pressure and mean concentrations of glucose, insulin, and C-reactive protein, with no between-group differences. The duodenal switch group, but not the gastric bypass group, had reductions in concentrations of vitamin A and 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Most Short Form-36 Health Survey dimensional scores improved in both groups, with greater improvement in 1 of 8 domains (bodily pain) after gastric bypass. From surgery until 2 years, 10 participants (32%) had adverse events after gastric bypass and 18 (62%) after duodenal switch (P = 0.021). Adverse events related to malnutrition occurred only after duodenal switch., LIMITATION: Clinical experience was greater with gastric bypass than with duodenal switch at the study centers., CONCLUSION: Duodenal switch surgery was associated with greater weight loss, greater reductions of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, and more adverse events.

Twelve months after SADI-S, the mean total body weight lost ranged from 21.5 to 41.2%, with no weight regain being observed after 24 months. The comorbidity resolution rate was 72.6% for diabetes, 77.2% for dyslipidemia, and 59.0% for hypertension cases. The need for reoperation was the most common postoperative complication. While several patients developed nutrient deficiencies, SADI-S seems to be an overall safe and effective bariatric operation.

Mohammed"	The Impact of Bariatric Surgery on Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Outcomes: A Systematic Review	2022	https://dx.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.23340		"Obesity and its complications are increasing in today's era, with cardiovascular health being one of the most significant obesity-related comorbidities. Hypertension in obesity is considered one of the major causes of death and disability due to their negative repercussions on cardiovascular health. Bariatric surgery is an approved therapeutic modality for obese people in classes II and III who have a body mass index (BMI) of more than 35 kg/m2 and 40 kg/m2, respectively. These weight loss surgeries are procedures that alter metabolism by causing weight reduction and altering gastrointestinal physiology, thereby considerably decreasing cardiometabolic risk factors that have been poorly understood to date. The purpose of this review is to explore the impact of bariatric surgery on reducing cardiac risk factors, in turn protecting the heart from succumbing to premature death. A literature search was done in the following databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, and PubMed Central (PMC). The studies taken into account for this review were observational studies published between 2016 and 2021 in the English language, where the quality was assessed using relevant quality appraisal methodologies. Finally, 10 reports were selected as definitive studies. Upon extensive evaluation of the final studies, it can be concluded that bariatric surgery results in significant weight loss, which lowers metabolic syndrome prevalence, cardiovascular risk factors, and major adverse cardiovascular events, particularly acute coronary events, and a favorable improvement in cardiac structure and function, altogether steering to reduced mortality due to cardiovascular diseases in obese patients. It is also worth noting that, while metabolic surgery can help patients with various metabolic comorbidities, the impact on individuals with hypertension is still debatable. Although the studies show significant effects on the cardiovascular system, these were only observational studies in geographically dispersed locations where each patient's lifestyle patterns and motivational levels could vary. Since real-world data are not fully explored due to the limited randomized controlled trials, it is suggested that further human trials on a larger scale be conducted to provide an even more factual conclusion.

Hemorrhagic complications (HC) are usually the result of stapler line bleeding and are probably underreported. The previous incidence of HC in our department including minor bleeding and late hematomas was 15.0 %. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of stapler line reinforcement (SLR) and intraoperative blood pressure control on HC after LSG., METHODS: Between February 2013 and March 2014, patients who were admitted to our department for LSG were randomly assigned to one of three arms: stapler line application of biologic glue--Evicel TM (E), over suture of the stapler line (S) or control (C). Surgical technique in all arms included blood pressure elevation to 140 mmHg before termination of the procedure. Data is presented as mean +/- SD or median (IQR 25-75)., RESULTS: One hundred sixty-five patients were randomized: 49 to E, 49 to S, and 67 to C. There were no demographic differences between arms. Operative time was significantly longer in S than in E and C arms (74 +/- 21 vs. 64 +/- 23 and 54 +/- 19 min, respectively). Hb was significantly lower in the S group. Packed cells were used in two from E and one from C arms. Late infected hematoma occurred in three (1.8 %) patients: one from E and two from C arms. Leak rate was 1.2 %: one from S and one from C arms. LOS was the same. No patients were re-operated due to bleeding., CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized trial, routine elevation of systolic blood pressure to 140 mmHg and over suture of the staple line in LSG minimized HC, with reasonable prolongation of the procedure."

After premedication with midazolam and metoclopramide 1 h before surgery, epidural catheter placement, induction of anesthesia with fentanyl and propofol, and tracheal intubation facilitated with succinylcholine, anesthesia was maintained with age-adjusted 1 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) desflurane or sevoflurane. Fentanyl IV, morphine or local anesthetics epidurally, and vasoactive drugs as needed were used to maintain arterial blood pressure at +/-20% of baseline value and to keep bispectral index of the electroencephalogram values between 40 to 60 U. Although patients were anesthetized with desflurane for a longer time (261 +/- 50 min versus 234 +/- 37 min, mean +/- sd; P < 0.05, desflurane versus sevoflurane, respectively) and for more MAC-hours (4.2 +/- 0.9 h versus 3.7 +/- 0.8 h; P < 0.05), significantly earlier recovery of response to command and tracheal extubation occurred in patients given desflurane than in patients given sevoflurane. The modified Aldrete score was greater in desflurane-anesthetized patients on admission to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) (P = 0.01) but not at discharge (P = 0.47). On admission to PACU, patients given desflurane had higher oxygen saturations (97.0% +/- 2.4%) than patients given sevoflurane (94.8% +/- 4.4%, P = 0.035). Overall, the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting and the use of antiemetics did not differ between the two anesthetic groups. We conclude that morbidly obese adult patients who underwent major abdominal surgery in a prospective, randomized study awoke significantly faster after desflurane than after sevoflurane anesthesia and the patients anesthetized with desflurane had higher oxygen saturation on entry to the PACU."

Obesity responds well to bariatric surgery, with major long-lasting weight loss that is most pronounced after RYGB and SG, where the mean weight loss is about 40 kg or 15 body mass index (BMI) units. Some of the benefits after RYGB and SG are independent of weight loss, and the remission of type 2 diabetes is observed a few days after the operation; this depends on changes in insulin sensitivity and gut hormone responses, especially a 10-fold increase in glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which improves insulin secretion. After gastric banding, the remission of diabetes depends more on weight loss. Bariatric surgery reduces cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, lipid disturbances, non-alcoholic fatty liver, musculoskeletal pain and reduces mortality of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancers. Bariatric surgery also improves quality of life. The acute complications of surgery are infection, bleeding and anastomotic leak. Long-term complications are nutritional deficiencies, including vitamins and minerals, and anemia. Some patients have dumping after meals, and a few patients will develop postprandial hypoglycemia after RYGB.

Dexmedetomidine (DEX) has been reported to allow the sedation of patients while maintaining their consciousness, and to be capable of keeping the respiration and circulation stable. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the sedation by using dexmedetomidine (DEX) during ESD. AIMS & METHODS: We performed a prospective study in 90 patients undergoing ESD who were randomly allocated into the DEX group (n = 30) (a bolus intravenous infusion of 3.0 mg/kg/hour over 5 min followed by continuous infusion at 0.4mg/kg/hour). propofol(PF)group(n = 30)and midazolam(MDZ)group(n = 30). In all groups, 1 mg of MDZ was added intravenously against restlessness, as necessary, during the procedure. In all cases, the procedures were conducted by the same endospopist. RESULTS: En bloc resection was achieved in 88 out of 90 patients(98%). In the DEX group, the reduction rate of blood pressure (p = 0.7) and Sp02(p < 0.0001)was lower than in the other groups. The mean dose of MDZ needed for additional sedation was significantly smaller(p = 0.01)in the PF group(p = 0.001) and the DEX group(p= 0.001)than in the MDZ group. The incidence of restlessness tended to be lower in the DEX group (p = 0.07). The appropriate sedation rate was significantly higher in the DEX group(p = 0.035) than in the other two groups. The mean treatment time was shorter(p = 0.035), the rate of En bloc resection tended to be higher (p = 0.15). and the rate of accidents tended to be lower (p = 0.01) in the DEX group than in the other two. CONCLUSION: Sedation with DEX was shown to have high efficacy and safety for ESD in patients with gastric neoplasms."

Laparoscopic surgery has been reported to be associated with an increased incidence of postoperative atelectasis. It has been shown that during general anesthesia, obese patients have a greater risk of atelectasis than nonobese patients. Preventing atelectasis is important for all patients but is especially important when caring for obese patients., METHODS: We randomly allocated 66 adult obese patients with a body mass index between 30 and 50 kg/m(2) scheduled to undergo laparoscopic bariatric surgery into 3 groups. According to the recruitment maneuver used, the zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP) group (n = 22) received the vital capacity maneuver (VCM) maintained for 7-8 s applied immediately after intubation plus ZEEP; the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5 group (n = 22) received the VCM maintained for 7-8 s applied immediately after intubation plus 5 cm H(2)O of PEEP; and the PEEP 10 group (n = 22) received the VCM maintained for 7-8 s applied immediately after intubation plus 10 cm H(2)O of PEEP. All other variables (e.g., anesthetic and surgical techniques) were the same for all patients. Heart rate, noninvasive mean arterial blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturation, and alveolar-arterial Pao(2) gradient (A-a Pao(2)) were measured intraoperatively and postoperatively in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Length of stay in the PACU and the use of a nonrebreathing O(2) mask (100% Fio(2)) or reintubation were also recorded. A computed tomographic scan of the chest was performed preoperatively and postoperatively after discharge from the PACU to evaluate lung atelectasis., RESULTS: Patients in the PEEP 10 group had better oxygenation both intraoperatively and postoperatively in the PACU, lower atelectasis score on chest computed tomographic scan, and less postoperative pulmonary complications than the ZEEP and PEEP 5 groups. There was no evidence of barotrauma in any patient in the 3 study groups., CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative alveolar recruitment with a VCM followed by PEEP 10 cm H(2)O is effective at preventing lung atelectasis and is associated with better oxygenation, shorter PACU stay, and fewer pulmonary complications in the postoperative period in obese patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery."

Nausea and vomiting are the most common complications after this procedure. The goal of this research is to compare the combined effect of promethazine/dexamethasone versus Metoclopramide/ dexamethasone on the prevention of nausea and vomiting after LGP. Methods: In recovery, the patients were divided into two groups, the Metoclopramide group which was given Metoclopramide 10 mg plus dexamethasone 4 mg/8 hours intravenous for 48 hours, and the promethazine group which was given promethazine 50 mg/12 hours, intramuscular for the first 24 hours and then promethazine 25 mg/12 hours for the next 24 hours plus dexamethasone 4 mg/8 hours intravenous for 48 hours. The frequency of nausea and vomiting, number of reflux episodes, frequency of epigastric fullness, and the duration of walking around q12 hours were recorded in the first 48 hours post_operation. Results: Eighty patients were enrolled into the study. Promethazine group were found to significantly reduce the incidence of PONV in the first 24 hours compared with the other group (41% vs. 97.5%), relative risk = 0.042 [95% CI = 0.006, 0.299]. The mean numbers of epigastric fullness and severity of epigastria pain were lower in the promethazine group (P = 0.01) and the total opioid requirement was also reduced in promethazine group (32.1±2.6 VS.68.5±4.6 mg). However, the patients in the promethazine group were more sedated, which caused the duration of walking q12 hours in this group to decrease. Conclusions: In morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric plication, promethazine/dexametasone was more effective than Metoclopramide/dexametasone in preventing and reducing the incidence of nausea, epigastric fullness, and reflux. That combination was also more effective than Metoclopramide in reducing the severity of epigastric pain."

Surgery is one of the most effective treatments for morbid obesity. In a prospective cohort study, we examined the effects of Laparoscopic Gastric Plication (LGP) as a new restrictive technique on remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods: During six years of study from June 2007 through December 2013, 62 patients who underwent bariatric surgery were recruited for our study to determine the effects of weight loss. Sixty patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 were selected for a one year follow up period. The amount of weight loss, Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS), changes in the lipid profile, HbA1c and blood pressure were assessed during this period. The primary outcomes were safety and the percentage of patients experiencing diabetes remission. Results: Sixty patients with the mean age of 39.7 +/_ 12.8 years, ranging from 18 to 62 years, were enrolled in the study for an average 12 months of follow up. The maximal weight loss of 57 kg was achieved at average after six months. FBS significantly decreased during this period, and after one year, remission of diabetes was achieved in 92 % of patients. In five patients, diabetes was controlled with decrease in taking oral medications. Conclusions: Laparoscopic Gastric Plication (LGP) resulted in significant and sustained weight loss with minimal physiologic changes in gastrointestinal tract and ameliorated blood glucose control of type 2 diabetes in morbid obese patients."

Information of obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery was obtained from their medical records. The changes in the BMI, HbA1C, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), and lipid levels between three months before and after the surgery were assessed., RESULTS: The patients (n=106) were mostly Malay (66.0%), had at least one comorbidity (61.3%), and had a mean age of 40.38+/-11.75 years. Following surgery, the BMI of the patients was found to reduce by 9.78+/-5.82kg/m2. For the patients who had diabetes (n=24) and hypertension (n=47), their mean HbA1C, SBP and DBP were also shown to reduce significantly by 2.02+/-2.13%, 17.19+/-16.97mmHg, and 11.45+/-12.63mmHg, respectively. Meanwhile, the mean total cholesterol, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein levels of those who had dyslipidaemia (n=21) were, respectively, lowered by 0.91+/-1.18mmol/L, 0.69+/-1.11mmol/L and 0.47+/-0.52mmol/L., CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that in addition to weight reduction, bariatric surgery is helpful in improving the diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemia control among obese patients. However, a large-scale trial with a control group is required to verify our findings."

This is well established with several well conducted RCTs providing class I evidence. Evidence for diabetic resolution post bariatric surgery for the not so obese, is not nearly as robust. We have embarked on a Randomised Controlled Trial for the not so obese in Asian population, comparing RYGB and best medical treatment. We think the result should go some way to provide class I evidence that RYGB is superior to best medical treatment in the not so obese Diabetics II. Material(s) and Method(s): Suitable subjects are of age 21-65, BMI 27-32, HBA1C>=8 %, type II DM <=10 years and at least one comorbidities on treatment, including hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, micro/macro-albuminuria or class I nephropathy, and retinopathy. They are on maximum treatment from their primary care physicians or endocrinologists. They need to be GAD negative and have a fasting c-peptide level of >300. Those deem suitable and willing will be randomised to best medical treatment or Roux-en- Y gastric bypass. We aim to recruit 20 subjects to each arm of the trial. Result(s): The trial started recruitment in mid-2014. To date we have a total of 6 subjects randomised, 2 in the RYGB surgical arm and 4 in the best medical treatment arm. As of January 2015, the 2 surgical subjects have completed their surgical intervention 4 and 2 months ago. Compared with the medical treatment arm, the surgical subjects have better improvement in HBA1C, BMI, weight and waist circumference. We will have 7 and 5 months data by April 2015. Conclusion(s): Very early result suggests that RYGB is better than best medical treatment for Type II Diabetic with a BMI of 27-32 according to measurable parameters. We hope to prove at least mid-term superiority of RYGB over best medical treatment for this group of not so obese Type II Diabetics in an Asian population."
M. Tanaka	Improving obesity and blood pressure	2020	https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41440-019-0348-x		"Obesity-associated hypertension is a serious public health concern. Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) overactivity, especially in the kidneys, is an important mechanism linking obesity to hypertension. Some adipokines play important roles in elevating blood pressure (BP). Hyperinsulinemia caused by insulin resistance stimulates sodium reabsorption, enhances sodium retention, and increases circulating plasma volume. Hyperinsulinemia also stimulates both the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the SNS, resulting in the acceleration of atherosclerosis through the hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells, which contributes to increased peripheral vascular resistance. Obesity is associated with increased RAAS activity despite volume overload, as the tissue RAASs are stimulated in obese hypertensive individuals. Mineralocorticoid receptor-associated hypertension must also be considered in obese patients with resistant hypertension. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Some components of the gut microbiota contribute to BP control; therefore, gut dysbiosis caused by obesity might lead to increased BP. The ratio of visceral fat to subcutaneous fat is higher in Japanese patients than in Caucasian patients, which may explain why Japanese patients are more susceptible to metabolic disorders even though they are less obese than Caucasian individuals. Obesity-associated kidney dysfunction directly increases BP, leading to further deterioration of kidney function. A bodyweight reduction of more than 3% or 5 kg significantly lowers BP. Gastrointestinal bypass surgery is an effective treatment for morbid obesity and its related metabolic disorders, including hypertension. Because both obesity and hypertension are representative lifestyle-related disorders, lifestyle modification, especially to improve obesity, should be performed first as a treatment for hypertension.Copyright © 2019, The Japanese Society of Hypertension."

Whilst greater early post-operative weight loss following LSG is associated with greater short-term weight loss, the relationship between early results and long-term outcomes has not been described., METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was performed on patients who underwent LSG 7 years before a follow-up telephone interview was performed. Multivariate regression analysis was used to explore the relationship between early weight loss at 4 weeks following surgery and weight loss at 7 years. A non-inferiority analysis assessed whether early weight loss was associated with either improvement or resolution of hypertension or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) at 7 years after surgery., RESULTS: Of the 156 patients identified between April and October 2012, 130 (83.3%) met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. The average preoperative BMI was 42.5 kg/m2 (standard deviation 5.2). The change in BMI was 4.6 kg/m2 (4.0) at 4 weeks and 12.2 kg/m2 (5.4) at 7 years. There was improvement or resolution in 19/31 (61.3%) patients with T2DM and 14/26 (53.8%) patients with hypertension. Whilst younger age was associated with greater weight loss at 7 years follow-up, no such relationship was identified with early post-operative weight loss. Early post-operative weight loss was also not associated with long-term improvement or resolution in hypertension or T2DM., CONCLUSIONS: Early weight loss does not appear to be associated with greater weight loss nor comorbidity improvement 7 years following LSG., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (SZMC-95/19)."
G. Targher and C. Byrne	Diagnosis and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and its hemostatic/thrombotic and vascular complications	2013	https://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0033-1334866		"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a spectrum of progressive liver disease encompassing simple steatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, and, ultimately, cirrhosis. NAFLD is strongly associated with features of the metabolic syndrome including abdominal overweight/obesity, hypertension, atherogenic dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, or type 2 diabetes. With the advent of increasingly sedentary lifestyles and changing dietary patterns, the prevalence of obesity and insulin resistance has increased and, with this, NAFLD has rapidly become the most common cause of chronic liver disease in many developed countries. Importantly, accumulating evidence indicates that NAFLD is strongly associated with a prothrombotic tendency, which may, at least in part, contribute to the increased risk of atherothrombotic events observed in these patients. NAFLD, especially in its necroinflammatory form (NASH), releases a variety of proinflammatory and prothrombotic mediators that play important roles in the development and progression of acute atherothrombotic complications. NAFLD also exacerbates systemic and hepatic insulin resistance and causes atherogenic dyslipidemia. The purpose of this review is to briefly discuss the epidemiology and diagnosis of NAFLD, to summarize the rapidly expanding body of evidence that supports a strong association between NAFLD and various disorders of coagulation and fibrinolysis and their implications for the development of atherothrombotic complications, and to discuss some of the treatment options that may influence both NAFLD and its related vascular complications. © 2013 by Thieme MedicalPublishers, Inc."

Specifically, this review will discuss the different types of metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) procedures, guidelines for patient selection, and recent findings regarding surgical outcomes and complications., RECENT FINDINGS: MBS is safe in adolescents and has also demonstrated sustainable long term weight loss and improvement in obesity-associated comorbidities. A recent prospective multi-institutional trial demonstrated BMI reductions of 3.8 kg/m2 (8%) to 15.1 kg/m2 (28%) after 3 years among adolescents undergoing the three most common MBS procedures. Moreover, MBS is associated with remission of type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and abnormal kidney function in 65-95% of patients in the study. Childhood and adolescent obesity is a continuing problem that has not been adequately addressed by the medical community. MBS is currently the most successful strategy for significant and sustained weight loss and improvement of associated comorbidities.

In this context, MAFLD appears to be tightly linked to incident chronic kidney disease (CKD). This association may be attributed to multiple shared risk factors including type 2 diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. Moreover, similarities in their molecular pathophysiologic mechanisms can be detected, since inflammation, oxidative stress, fibrosis, and gut dysbiosis are highly prevalent in these pathologic states. At the same time, lines of evidence suggest a genetic predisposition to MAFLD due to gene polymorphisms, such as the PNPLA3 rs738409 G allele polymorphism, which may also propagate renal dysfunction. Concerning their management, available treatment considerations for obesity (bariatric surgery) and novel antidiabetic agents (glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors) appear beneficial in preclinical and clinical studies of MAFLD and CKD modeling. Moreover, alternative approaches such as melatonin supplementation, farnesoid X receptor agonists, and gut microbiota modulation may represent attractive options in the future. With a look to the future, additional adequately sized studies are required, focusing on preventing renal complications in patients with MAFLD and the appropriate management of individuals with concomitant MAFLD and CKD.Copyright ©The Author(s) 2022.

Bouillot"	Midterm outcomes of gastric bypass for elderly (aged >= 60 yr) patients: a comparative study	2015	https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2014.10.022		"BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is feasible for patients aged 60 years and older and is associated with a favorable early weight loss. However, data with longer follow-up in this age group are scarce. The present study compared weight loss and changes in co-morbidities 3 years after LRYGB between older patients (OP; >= 60 yr) and younger patients (YP; <60 yr). Data were collected prospectively in a single surgery university center (Paris, France)., METHODS: Between January 2004 and May 2011, 48 OP and 610 YP underwent LRYGB. Three-year outcomes were available for 42 (87.5%) OP and 480 (78.7%) YP; 42 OP undergoing LRYGB were matched with 84 YP for sex, preoperative body mass index (BMI), and presence of type 2 diabetes., RESULTS: The sample was 81% female; preoperative BMI was 45.6 +/- 6.4 kg/m2 in OP versus 47.3 +/- 5.2 kg/m2 in YP patients (P = .12), and age was 62.6 +/- 2.3 years in OP versus 42.9 +/- 8.7 years in YP (P < .0001). The prevalence of coexisting conditions was comparable in both groups except for dyslipidemia (66.7% in OP versus 42.9% in YP; P = .01). At 3 years, percentage of weight loss and BMI change (kg/m2) was significantly lower in the OP group compared with YP (27.5 +/- 8.6 versus 31.8 +/- 12.1, P = .04; and -12.7 +/- 4.9 versus -15.2 +/- 6.2, P = .03). The rate of remission of hypertension was lower in OP than in YP (18.8% versus 53.8%; P = .002), as was that of both obstructive sleep apnea (60.6% versus 87.9%; P = .004) and dyslipidemia (42.9% versus 75.0%; P = .01)., CONCLUSIONS: At 3 years, despite less favorable impact on weight than for younger patients, LRYGB provided significant weight loss and remission of co-morbidities for patients aged > 60 years. Long-term trials are needed to better evaluate the benefit of bariatric surgery in aging obese patients. Copyright © 2015 American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery.

This is partially attributable to dilatation of the gastrojejunostomy (GJ), which diminishes the restrictive capacity of RYGB. Endoluminal interventions for GJ reduction are being explored as alternatives to revision surgery. We performed a randomized, blinded, sham-controlled trial to evaluate weight loss after sutured transoral outlet reduction (TORe). Method(s): Patients with weight regain or inadequate loss after RYGB and GJ diameter greater than 2 cm were assigned randomly to groups that underwent TORe (n = 50) or a sham procedure (controls, n = 27). Intraoperative performance, safety, weight loss, and clinical outcomes were assessed. Result(s): Subjects who received TORe had a significantly greater mean percentage weight loss from baseline (3.5%; 95% confidence interval, 1.8%-5.3%) than controls (0.4%; 95% confidence interval, 2.3% weight gain to 3.0% weight loss) (P =.021), using a last observation carried forward intent-to-treat analysis. As-treated analysis also showed greater mean percentage weight loss in the TORe group than controls (3.9% and 0.2%, respectively; P =.014). Weight loss or stabilization was achieved in 96% subjects receiving TORe and 78% of controls (P =.019). The TORe group had reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure (P <.001) and a trend toward improved metabolic indices. In addition, 85% of the TORe group reported compliance with the healthy lifestyle eating program, compared with 53.8% of controls; 83% of TORe subjects said they would undergo the procedure again, and 78% said they would recommend the procedure to a friend. The groups had similar frequencies of adverse events. Conclusion(s): A multicenter randomized trial provides Level I evidence that TORe reduces weight regain after RYGB. These results were achieved using a superficial suction-based device; greater levels of weight loss could be achieved with newer, full-thickness suturing devices. TORe is one approach to avoid weight regain; a longitudinal multidisciplinary approach with dietary counseling and behavioral changes are required for long-term results.

Biousse"	An update on idiopathic intracranial hypertension	2010	https://dx.doi.org/10.3909/rind0256		"Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition of unknown etiology often encountered in neurologic practice. It produces nonlocalizing symptoms and signs of raised intracranial pressure and, when left untreated, can result in severe irreversible visual loss. It most commonly occurs in obese women of childbearing age, but it can also occur in children, men, nonobese adults, and older adults. Although it is frequently associated with obesity, it can be associated with other conditions, such as obstructive sleep apnea and transverse cerebral venous sinus stenoses. Recent identification of subgroups at high risk for irreversible visual loss, including black patients, men, and patients with fulminant forms of IIH, help guide the optimal management and follow-up. Ongoing studies of venous anatomy and physiology in IIH patients, as well as a recently begun randomized clinical treatment trial, should provide further insight into this common yet poorly understood syndrome. © 2010 MedReviews, LLC."

Wall	"Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (Pseudotumor Cerebri): Recognition, treatment, and ongoing management"	2013	https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11940-012-0207-4		"Opinion statement: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH, pseudotumor cerebri) is a syndrome of elevated intracranial pressure of unknown cause that occurs predominantly in obese women of childbearing age. It is a diagnosis of exclusion and, therefore, other causes of increased intracranial pressure must be sought with history, imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid examination before the diagnosis can be made. IIH produces symptoms and signs of increased intracranial pressure, including papilledema. If untreated, papilledema can cause progressive irreversible visual loss and optic atrophy. The treatment approach depends on the severity and time course of symptoms and visual loss, as determined by formal visual field testing. The main goals of treatment are alleviation of symptoms, including headache, and preservation of vision. All overweight IIH patients should be encouraged to enter a weight-management program with a goal of 5-10 % weight loss, along with a low-salt diet. When there is mild visual loss, medical treatment with acetazolamide should be initiated. Other medical treatments can be added or substituted when acetazolamide is insufficient as monotherapy or poorly tolerated. When visual loss is more severe or rapidly progressive, surgical interventions, such as optic nerve sheath fenestration or cerebrospinal fluid shunting, may be required to prevent further irreversible visual loss. The choice of intervention depends on the relative severity of symptoms and visual loss, as well as local expertise. At present, the role of transverse venous sinus stenting remains unclear. Although there are no evidence-based data to guide therapy, there is an ongoing randomized double-blind placebo-controlled treatment trial, investigating diet and acetazolamide therapy for IIH. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Strict selection criteria were followed. All subjects were diagnosed by endoscopy during the first 18 h after admission. Endoscopic stigmata of recent haemorrhage were also evaluated. Sixty_five per cent of the subjects presented with severe upper GI bleeding (blood pressure less than or equal to 100 mmHg, pulse rate greater than or equal to 110, haematocrit less than or equal to 30 per cent), and in 71.6 per cent stigmata were found. Thirty patients (Group 1) received a somatostatin infusion (250 micrograms/h continuously during 120 h) and 30 patients (Group 2) received cimetidine (200 mg IV every 4 h for 5 days) and pirenzepine (10 mg IV every 8 h for 5 days). Both groups were homogeneous for sex, age, backgrounds, bleeding source, grade of bleeding (moderate or severe) and presence or not of stigmata. Bleeding stopped in 27 subjects of Group 1 (90 per cent and in 20 subjects of Group 2 (66.67 per cent) (P less than 0.05, chi 2 test). The time until the bleeding stopped was significantly shorter in patients of group 1 (3.44 +/_ 0.53 h) than in patients of group 2 (8.12 +/_ 1.94 h) (P less than 0.05, Mann_Whitney U test). The number of blood units required for Group 1 (2.26 +/_ 0.35) was significantly lower than the one required for Group 2 (3.90 +/_ 0.51) (P less than 0.005, Wilcoxon test). Significant differences were not observed between the two groups regarding cross_over subjects, re_bleeding, surgery (P = 0.0635, Fisher's exact test) and hospital stay. The mortality of the trial was 5 per cent. There was no toxicity during somatostatin, cimetidine or pirenzepine infusion. In conclusion, somatostatin was more effective than cimetidine plus pirenzepine in the control of severe upper GI bleeding of peptic origin, with a lower interval time to stop bleeding and reduced transfusion requirements."

Paganelli"	Randomized comparison of isoflurane and sevoflurane for laparoscopic gastric banding in morbidly obese patients	2001			"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and recovery profile of sevoflurane and isoflurane as the main anesthetics for morbidly obese patients., DESIGN: Randomized, blinded study., SETTING: Inpatients., PATIENTS: 30 ASA physical status II and III obese patients [body mass index (BMI) > 35 kg/m(2)] undergoing laparoscopic gastric banding for morbid obesity., INTERVENTIONS: After standard intravenous induction of general anesthesia and tracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with either sevoflurane or isoflurane as the main anesthetics. The end-tidal concentrations of the volatile drugs were adjusted to maintain systolic arterial blood pressure within +/-20% from baseline values. When the surgeon started the skin suture, the end-tidal concentration of the inhalational drug was reduced to 0.5 minimum alveolar concentration in both groups. At the last skin suture, the inhalational drug was discontinued and the vaporizator was removed to allow blinded evaluation of the emergence times., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: No differences in anesthetic exposure, hemodynamic parameters, incidence of untoward events, or postoperative pain relief were reported between the two groups. Extubation, emergence, and response times were shorter after sevoflurane [6 min (3-15 min), 8 min (5-18 min), and 12 (6-25 min)] than isoflurane [10 min (6-26 min), 14 min (6-21 min), and 21 min (14-41 min)] (p = 0.001, p = 0.03, and p = 0.0005, respectively). The median time for postanesthesia care unit discharge was 15 minutes (25th-75th percentiles: 10-18 min) after sevoflurane and 27 minutes (25th-75th percentiles: 20-30 min) after isoflurane (p = 0.0005)., CONCLUSIONS: Sevoflurane provides a safe and effective intraoperative control of cardiovascular homeostasis in morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric banding, with the advantage of a faster recovery and earlier discharge from the postanesthesia care unit than isoflurane."

METHODS: With Ethical Committee approval and written informed consent, 14 obese patients (BMI >35 kg/m2), ASA physical status II, undergoing laparoscopic, silicone_adjustable gastric banding were randomly allocated to receive either sevoflurane (n=7) or isoflurane (n=7) as main anesthetic agents. General anesthesia was induced with 1 mg x kg_1 fentanyl, 6 mg x kg_1 sodium thiopental, and 1 mg x kg_1 succinylcholine followed by 0.4 mg kg_1 x h_1 atracurium bromide (doses were referred to ideal body weight). Intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) was applied using a Servo_900C ventilator with a nonrebreathing circuit and a 15 l x min_1 fresh gas flow (tidal volume: of 10 ml x kg_1; respiratory rate: 12 breaths/min; inspiratory to expiratory time ratio of 1:2) using an oxygen/air mixture (FiO2=50%), while supplemental boluses of thiopental or fentanyl were given as indicated in order to maintain blood pressure and heart rate values within +/_20% from baseline. After adequate placement of tracheal tube and stabilization of the ventilation parameters, 2% sevoflurane or 1.2% isoflurane was given for 30 min via a nonrebreathing circuit. End_tidal samples were collected at 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 min, and measured using a calibrated infrared gas analyzer. General anesthesia was then maintained with the same inhalational agents, while supplemental fentanyl was given as indicated. After the last skin suture the inhalational agents were suspended, and the end tidal samples were collected at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, and 5 min. Then the lungs were manually ventilated until extubation. RESULTS: No differences in age, gender and body mass index were reported between the two groups. Surgical procedure required 91+/_13 in the sevoflurane group and 83+/_32 min in the isoflurane group. The FA/FI ratio was higher in the sevoflurane group from the 5th to the 30th min. Also the washout curve was faster in the sevoflurane group during the observation period; however, the observed differences were statistically significant only 30 and 60 sec after discontinuation of the inhalational agents. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this prospective, randomized study confirmed that sevoflurane provides more rapid wash_in and wash_out curves than isoflurane also in the morbid obese patient."
"G. E. Trope, C. Lam and Y. M. Buys"	Effect of weight loss on intraocular pressure	2015			"Purpose: Numerous population-based studies have found an association between obesity and ocular hypertension. The etiology is unknown but may be due to increased intra-abdominal pressure causing increased episcleral venous pressure and choroidal vascular congestion. We previously reported that obese patients had higher IOP compared to normal weight controls across different positions. This current study was to evaluate the effect of significant weight loss on IOP. Method(s): This was a prospective cohort study enrolling 25 morbidly obese patients who participated in our previous study and were invited to return following bariatric surgery. Subjects had tonometry performed in 7 positions: sitting with the neck in neutral position, flexion at 30degree, and extension at 30degree, supine, right and left lateral decubitus, and with the head and upper body elevated at 30degree. The order of measurements was randomized. Result(s): 18 patients completed follow-up after bariatric surgery (mean = 17 months post-op). Mean weight loss was 49.1 kg, or 36% of total body weight. The mean IOP in the right eye was significantly lower following bariatric surgery in each position (mean difference 1.8+/-0.3 mmHg), except for the right eye in left lateral decubitus. There was no significant decrease in the IOP post surgery in the left eye, except for the supine head up position and in right lateral decubitus. Linear regression of percentage body weight lost and postoperative decrease in sitting IOP in the right eye demonstrated that every 10% body weight lost was correlated with 0.7 mmHg decrease in IOP (r2 = 0.21). Conclusion(s): We previously reported that obesity was associated with increased IOP compared to normal weight controls. Weight loss however was only weakly correlated with IOP lowering. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism of increased IOP in obesity and whether other systemic factors, such as insulin resistance or blunted autonomic response, are at play."

Consensus is still lacking on whether a short or long alimentary limb is superior regarding weight loss, comorbidity resolution, and complications. The aim of this study was to compare the long-term outcomes after short alimentary limb (SAL) and long alimentary limb (LAL) RYGB. Method(s): Morbidly obese patients were randomized to receive either a short alimentary limb (80cm) or long alimentary limb (250cm) RYGB at a single institution in Bern, Switzerland in 2003. Patients were followed up annually in an outpatient bariatric center, and those who completed a minimum of 10 years' followup were included in this study. Patients' medical records were reviewed and analyzed for complications, weight loss outcomes, comorbidity resolution, and development of dumping syndrome. Result(s): A total of 41 patients were randomized to the SAL group and 46 patients to the LAL group. There were no differences in baseline body mass index (BMI), age, gender, nor rate of comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) between the two groups. Sufficient follow-up was available for 70.7% of the SAL group and 84.8% of the LAL group. Mean follow-up time for the SAL group was 14.2 years (R12-15) and 13.8 years (R10-15) for the LAL group. There were no differences in rates of leak, infection, nor bleeding between the two groups. At most recent follow-up, mean excess weight loss (EWL) was 66.8% (R37.4-96.9) for the SAL group and 64.4% (R33.5-93.3) in the LAL group (p=0.84). The rate of comorbidity resolution was similar between the two groups. Specifically, 38.5% of diabetes cases resolved in the SAL group and 50% resolved in the LAL group (p=0.71). There were no differences in development of dumping syndrome between the two groups (19.2% vs 10%, SAL vs LAL, respectively, p=0.45). One patient from the SAL group died from cancer. Otherwise, no deaths were recorded. Conclusion(s): Alimentary limb length does not influence long-term outcomes after RYGB. Weight loss outcomes and comorbidity control between SAL RYGB and LAL RYGB are similar. Limb length does not affect the rate of developing dumping syndrome.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

We designed this prospective, randomized, double_blind, and placebo_controlled dose_ranging study to evaluate the effect of Dex on both early and late recovery after laparoscopic bariatric surgery. METHODS: Eighty consenting ASA II_III morbidly obese patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups: (1) control group received a saline infusion during surgery, (2) Dex 0.2 group received an infusion of 0.2 microg x kg(_1) x h(_1) IV, (3) Dex 0.4 group received an infusion of 0.4 microg x kg(_1) x h(_1) IV, and (4) Dex 0.8 group received an infusion of 0.8 microg x kg(_1) x h(_1) IV. Mean arterial blood pressure values were maintained within +/_25% of the preinduction baseline values by varying the inspired desflurane concentration. Perioperative hemodynamic variables, postoperative pain scores, and the need for ""rescue"" analgesics and antiemetics were recorded at specific intervals. Follow_up evaluations were performed on postoperative days (PODs) 1, 2, and 7 to assess severity of pain, analgesic requirements, patient satisfaction with pain management, quality of recovery, as well as resumption of dietary intake and recovery of bowel function. RESULTS: Dex infusion, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 microg x kg(_1) x h(_1), reduced the average end_tidal desflurane concentration by 19, 20, and 22%, respectively. However, it failed to facilitate a significantly faster emergence from anesthesia. Although the intraoperative hemodynamic values were similar in the four groups, arterial blood pressure values were significantly reduced in the Dex 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 groups compared with the control group on admission to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) (P < 0.05). The length of the PACU stay was significantly reduced in the Dex groups (81 +/_ 31 to 87 +/_ 24 vs 104 +/_ 33 min in the control group, P < 0.05). The amount of rescue fentanyl administered in the PACU was significantly less in the Dex 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 groups versus control group (113 +/_ 85, 108 +/_ 67, and 120 +/_ 78 vs 187 +/_ 99 microg, respectively, P < 0.05). The percentage of patients requiring antiemetic therapy was also reduced in the Dex groups (30, 30, and 10% vs 70% in the control group). However, the patient_controlled analgesia morphine requirements on PODs 1 and 2 were not different among the four groups. Pain scores in the PACU, and on PODs 1, 2, and 7, in the three Dex groups were not different from the control group. Finally, quality of recovery scores and times to recovery of bowel function and hospital discharge did not differ among the four groups. CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive use of an intraoperative Dex infusion (0.2_0.8 microg x kg(_1) x h(_1)) decreased fentanyl use, antiemetic therapy, and the length of stay in the PACU. However, it failed to facilitate late recovery (e.g., bowel function) or improve the patients' overall quality of recovery. When used during bariatric surgery, a Dex infusion rate of 0.2 microg x kg(_1) x h(_1) is recommended to minimize the risk of adverse cardiovascular side effects."

Jordan"	Interventions for the management of obesity in people with bipolar disorder	2020	https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013006.pub2		"BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder is one of the most common serious mental illnesses, affecting approximately 60 million people worldwide. Characterised by extreme alterations in mood, cognition, and behaviour, bipolar disorder can have a significant negative impact on the functioning and quality of life of the affected individual. Compared with the general population, the prevalence of comorbid obesity is significantly higher in bipolar disorder. Approximately 68% of treatment seeking bipolar patients are overweight or obese. Clinicians are aware that obesity has the potential to contribute to other physical health conditions in people with bipolar disorder, including diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and coronary heart disease. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of premature death in bipolar disorder, happening a decade or more earlier than in the general population. Contributing factors include illness-related factors (mood-related factors, i.e. mania or depression), treatment-related factors (weight implications and other side effects of medications), and lifestyle factors (physical inactivity, poor diet, smoking, substance abuse). Approaches to the management of obesity in individuals with bipolar disorder are diverse and include non-pharmacological interventions (i.e. dietary, exercise, behavioural, or multi-component), pharmacological interventions (i.e. weight loss drugs or medication switching), and bariatric surgery., OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of interventions for the management of obesity in people with bipolar disorder., SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR) and the Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to February 2019. We ran additional searches via Ovid databases including MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycInfo to May 2020. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP)) and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also checked the reference lists of all papers brought to full-text stage and all relevant systematic reviews., SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), randomised at the level of the individual or cluster, and cross-over designs of interventions for management of obesity, in which at least 80% of study participants had a clinical diagnosis of bipolar disorder and comorbid obesity (body mass index (BMI) >= 30 kg/m2), were eligible for inclusion. No exclusions were based on type of bipolar disorder, stage of illness, age, or gender. We included non-pharmacological interventions comprising dietary, exercise, behavioural, and multi-component interventions; pharmacological interventions consisting of weight loss medications and medication switching interventions; and surgical interventions such as gastric bypass, gastric bands, biliopancreatic diversion, and vertical banded gastroplasty. Comparators included the following approaches: dietary intervention versus inactive comparator; exercise intervention versus inactive comparator; behavioural intervention versus inactive comparator; multi-component lifestyle intervention versus inactive comparator; medication switching intervention versus inactive comparator; weight loss medication intervention versus inactive comparator; and surgical intervention versus inactive comparator. Primary outcomes of interest were changes in body mass, patient-reported adverse events, and quality of life., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Four review authors were involved in the process of selecting studies. Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of studies identified in the search. Studies brought to the full-text stage were then screened by another two review authors working independently. However, none of the full-text studies met the inclusion criteria. Had we included studies, we would have assessed their methodological quality by using the criteria recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We intended to co bine dichotomous data using risk ratios (RRs), and continuous data using mean differences (MDs). For each outcome, we intended to calculate overall effect size with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)., MAIN RESULTS: None of the studies that were screened met the inclusion criteria., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: None of the studies that were assessed met the inclusion criteria of this review. Therefore we were unable to determine the effectiveness of interventions for the management of obesity in individuals with bipolar disorder. Given the extent and impact of the problem and the absence of evidence, this review highlights the need for research in this area. We suggest the need for RCTs that will focus only on populations with bipolar disorder and comorbid obesity. We identified several ongoing studies that may be included in the update of this review.

A randomized controlled trial	2013	https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cen.12109		"BACKGROUND: Morbid obesity is a major health problem and bariatric surgery is currently the most effective therapy available to induce weight loss in these patients. This report describes 1-year changes in weight and metabolic parameters, in a trial designed to examine the effects of a nonsurgical approach, Intensive Life style Intervention (ILI) on the therapy of morbid obesity., METHODS: The primary outcome was change in body weight. Patients were randomized to ILI (n = 60) or conventional obesity therapy (COT) (n = 46). The ILI group received behavioural therapy and nutritional/physical activity counselling. The COT group received the standard medical treatment available for these patients. A third group consisted of the patients already included in our bariatric surgery waiting list (n = 37)., FINDINGS: We present here 1-year data showing that patients who received ILI with no restrictions in calorie intake had a greater percentage of weight loss than patients receiving COT (-11.58% vs -0.4%; P < 0.001). Importantly, 31.4% of patients included in the ILI group were not morbidly obese after 6 months of intervention. This number increased to 42.8% after 12 months of intervention., INTERPRETATION: ILI was associated with significant weight loss compared with COT in a group of morbidly obese patients. The weight loss effect was already obtained after 6 months of ILI intervention. These results seriously question the efficacy of the COT approach to morbid obesity. Furthermore, they underscore the use of ILI programmes in the hospital setting to effectively treat morbidly obese patients and might help to reduce the number of candidate patients for bariatric surgery.

Parallels in the Evolution of Obesity and Hypertension as Recognized Disease States	2017	https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11883-017-0671-0		"Obesity and hypertension are recognized disease states that share many similarities including complex physiology, therapeutic response to both lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy, and the need for long-term management. Both were initially believed to be disorders of lifestyle rather than true disease entities, and initial efforts at developing medical and surgical therapies were criticized. Ultimately, both have proven to be amenable to treatments that control their underlying physiology. Both hypertension and obesity have complex pathophysiology involving multiple regulatory pathways that may require combination therapies in addition to lifestyle modification to reach therapeutic goals. While hypertension is now a mature field practiced widely in primary care with the availability of 127 antihypertensive drugs, the specialty of obesity medicine is still in its infancy and growing in terms of management and development of medications, devices, and minimally invasive surgical interventions. Although the medical antiobesity armamentarium is relatively limited at present to six FDA-approved drugs, the development of combination pharmacotherapies with lower doses of component agents has improved efficacy and tolerability. As we look to the future of obesity medicine, hypertension can be used as a template to educate the public, fund research, and develop further treatment strategies.Copyright © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."
"A. Umemura, W.-J. Lee, A. Sasaki and G. Wakabayashi"	History and current status of bariatric and metabolic surgeries in East Asia	2015	https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ases.12190		"Morbid obesity and obesity-related comorbidities are major public health problems around the world, including in East Asia. Although Asian populations have been shown to have an elevated risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia at a relatively lower BMI than Western populations, the Asian perspective on bariatric and metabolic surgeries has not been actively discussed until recently. Bariatric surgery in East Asia has undergone a paradigm shift since the first laparoscopic vertical bariatric surgery was performed in Taiwan in 1998, which was subsequently followed by the introduction of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and mini-gastric bypass. Since 2006, use of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy has remarkably increased because of its ease, speed, and safety. With regard to metabolic surgery, a randomized controlled trial in Taiwan demonstrated that laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is more effective than laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for surgical treatment of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome. In this article, we describe the history of bariatric procedures, revision surgeries, weight-loss effect, and metabolic surgeries in Asian populations, and we also discuss minimally invasive bariatric surgery with some important citations.

Although bariatric surgery is an efficacious treatment approach, it is limited in reach; thus, nonsurgical treatment alternatives are needed. We examined the 4-year effects of an intensive lifestyle intervention on body weight and cardiovascular disease risk factors among severely obese, compared with overweight (25 <=BMI <30), class I (30 <=BMI <35), and class II obese (35 <=BMI <40) participants., METHODS: There were 5145 individuals with type 2 diabetes (45-76 years, BMI >=25 kg/m(2)) randomized to an intensive lifestyle intervention or diabetes support and education. The lifestyle intervention group received a behavioral weight loss program that included group and individual meetings, a >=10% weight loss goal, calorie restriction, and increased physical activity. Diabetes support and education received a less intense educational intervention. Four-year changes in body weight and cardiovascular disease risk factors were assessed., RESULTS: Across BMI categories, 4-year changes in body weight were significantly greater in lifestyle participants compared with diabetes support and education (Ps <.05). At year 4, severely obese lifestyle participants lost 4.9%+/-8.5%, which was similar to class I (4.8%+/-7.2%) and class II obese participants (4.4%+/-7.6%), and significantly greater than overweight participants (3.4%+/-7.0%; P <.05). Four-year changes in low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, diastolic blood pressure, HbA(1c), and blood glucose were similar across BMI categories in lifestyle participants; however, the severely obese had less favorable improvements in high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (3.1+/-0.4 mg/dL) and systolic blood pressure (-1.4+/-0.7 mm Hg) compared with the less obese (Ps <.05)., CONCLUSION: Lifestyle interventions can result in important long-term weight losses and improvements in cardiovascular disease risk factors among a significant proportion of severely obese individuals.

M. Uusitupa	New aspects in the management of obesity: operation and the impact of lipase inhibitors	1999			"Obesity is an increasing health problem in most developed countries and its prevalence is also increasing in developing countries. There has been no great success with dietary means and life style modification for permanent weight loss. Various surgical treatment methods for obesity are now available. They are aimed at limiting oral energy intake with or without causing dumping or inducing selective maldigestion and malabsorption. Based on current literature, up to 75% of excess weight is lost by surgical treatment with concomitant disappearance of hyperlipidaemias, type 2 diabetes, hypertension or sleep apnoea. The main indication for operative treatment is morbid obesity (body mass index greater than 40 kg/m2) or severe obesity (body mass index > 35 kg/m2) with comorbidities of obesity. Orlistat is a new inhibitor of pancreatic lipase enzyme. At doses of 120 mg three times per day with meals it results in a 30% reduction in dietary fat absorption, which equals approximately 200 kcal daily energy deficit. In the long term, orlistat has been shown to be more effective than placebo in reducing body weight and serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Orlistat has a lowering effect on serum cholesterol independent of weight loss. Along with weight loss, orlistat also favourably affects blood pressure and glucose and insulin levels in obese individuals and in obese type 2 diabetic patients."

PRELIMINARY RESULTS AT 6 MONTHS FOLLOW-UP FROM A PROSPECTIVE, SINGLE CENTER, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL"	2022	https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ueg2.12294		"Introduction: Endoscopic Gastroplasty (EG) is an endoscopic therapy to treat obese patients focusing on gastric body remodeling. Nowadays three different techniques are described in literature: endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) with an overstitch endoscopic suturing device, endoluminal vertical gastroplasty (EVG) with a simple triangulation platform and endoluminal suturing device, and distal primary obesity surgery endoluminal (D-POSE) with an endoscopic plication system. Aims & Methods: Our study aimed to assess feasibility, safety, and efficacy of these three techniques compared to a control group. This was a prospective, single center, randomized controlled trial (Clinical- Trials.gov NCT04854317) of patients who underwent EG (through ESG or EVG or D-POSE) or a low-calorie Mediterranean diet (1600 and 1400 Kcal/ day for men and women, respectively; 50% carbohydrates, 30% fats, 20% proteins) for treatment of obesity. Outcomes included technical success rate, serious adverse event rate, and efficacy of the three EG procedures at inducing weight loss, improving obesity-related comorbidities and quality of life, compared to the diet group. Result(s): Between July 2020 and October 2021, 120 obese (body mass index 37.5 +/- 3.5 kg/m2) patients (mean age, 46 +/- 10 years; females 87.8%; obesity class II as the main obesity class in 58.3% cases; hepatic steatosis as the main comorbidity with a 70% frequency) underwent EG (through ESG or EVG or D-POSE, with 30 patients for each procedure, 90 patients in total) or a low-calorie diet (30 patients). In the EG group the technical success rate was 100%. The serious adverse event rate was 0%. At 6 months, 63/90 (70%) patients attended their follow- up visit. They experienced 16% +/- 6% total body weight loss (TBWL) and 39.7% +/- 14.9% excess weight loss (EWL), with no significant difference among the three techniques in both of parameters (p>0.62 in TBWL% and p>0.94 in EWL% ANOVA tests). Concerning the low-calorie diet group, 18/30 (60%) patients attended their 6 months follow-up visit; they experienced 1.1% +/- 4.7% TBWL (p<0.001 versus EG group) and 2.3% +/- 9.8% EWL (p<0.001 versus EG group). Sixty out of sixty-three (95.2%) patients achieved at least 5% TBWL, and 54/63 (85.7%) achieved at least 25% EWL in the EG group, compared to 2/18 (11.1%) and 1/18 (5.6%) in the diet group, respectively. Fatty liver disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and obstructive sleep apnea improved after the EG procedure, while no improvement was observed in the diet group. Also, the quality of life measured by EQ-5D test improved at 6-month follow-up (p<0.01) in the EG group, while no significant improvement was detected in the diet group. Conclusion(s): EG through ESG, EVG and D-POSE, focusing on gastric body reduction and sparing the fundus and antrum, are technically feasible and safe, and appear to be effective in the short-term (6 months follow-up) for the treatment of obese patients, compared to diet."

Obesity is associated with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The current treatment paradigm emphasizes lifestyle modifications, including diet and exercise; however this approach produces only modest weight loss for many patients. When lifestyle modifications fail, the current ""gold standard"" therapy for obesity is bariatric surgery, including Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, duodenal switch, and placement of an adjustable gastric band. Though effective, bariatric surgery can have severe short- and long-term complications. To fill the major gap in invasiveness between lifestyle modification and surgery, researchers have been developing pharmacotherapies and minimally invasive endoscopic techniques to treat obesity. Recently, interventional radiologists developed a percutaneous transarterial catheter-directed therapy targeting the hormonal function of the stomach. This review describes the current standard obesity treatments (including diet, exercise, and surgery), as well as newer endoscopic bariatric procedures and pharmacotherapies to help patients lose weight. We present data from two ongoing human trials of a new interventional radiology procedure for weight loss, bariatric embolization. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Postanesthesia care unit (PACU)-measured variables on admission and at 15 minute intervals until discharge included oxygen saturation (Spo2), blood pressure, heart rate, pain and nausea Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores, emesis, modified Aldrete score, and Mini-Mental Status (MMS) examination score., MAIN RESULTS: No differences were noted in demographic data, total surgical operative time, times from turning inhalation agent off to eye opening and extubation, or average length of stay in PACU. No differences were noted with respect to pain VAS, treatment for pain, modified Aldrete scores, emesis, or treatment for postoperative nausea or emesis. Differences were noted in PACU nausea VAS at 15 minutes, PACU nausea VAS at discharge, and PACU-MMS score at 45 minutes; however, multivariate analysis of variance revealed no differences between groups over the repeated PACU measured time periods in nausea VAS (P=0.17) or in MMS (P=0.34). Higher heart rates in the desflurane group were observed during PACU admission (82.3+/-9.8 vs 74.4+/-13.4 bpm, P<0.01) and 15 minutes post PACU admission (79.4+/-12.1 vs 71.3+/-13.2 bpm, P=0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: In morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic gastroplasty, emergence, as measured by time to eye opening, did not differ between desflurane and sevoflurane, with similar recovery characteristics."

De Block	Bariatric surgery to treat type 2 diabetes: What is the recent evidence?	2012	https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MED.0b013e328357f0e0		"Purpose of review: To critically discuss the strengths and shortcomings of recent progress achieved with bariatric surgery in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), focussing on efficacy aspects (remission of diabetes and cardiovascular comorbidities). Despite an increasing armamentarium of pharmacotherapeutics to overcome several challenges, only 10% of T2DM patients achieve a composite goal of HbA1c, blood pressure and lipids. Bariatric surgery has emerged as a solution to these challenges in morbid obesity. Whether the same advantages can be translated into T2DM remains a matter of debate, certainly regarding safety, durability of diabetes recovery and long-term outcome. Recent findings: Bariatric surgery in T2DM patients with a BMI of at least 35kg/m2 has been shown to result in a 56% excess body weight loss, resolution of hypertension in 62%, amelioration of dyslipidaemia in greater than 70% and diabetes remission in 57-95%, depending on the type of surgery and the definition of diabetes resolution. These impressive results, and the fact that diabetes recovery often occurs before prominent weight loss is evident, have urged bariatric surgeons to consider surgical procedures as a valuable approach for diabetes control and diabetes remission in patients with a BMI ranging between 30 and 35kg/m2. Summary: Bariatric surgery is emerging as a valid option to treat T2DM, improving glycaemia and cardiovascular risk factors. However, there needs to be an agreed definition of resolution of diabetes in future studies and long-term efficacy is to be proven. For now, the challenge is to determine how to offer bariatric surgery in a responsible fashion. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

Methods: In a multicenter, randomized, single_blind, comparative study of HBOC_201 versus allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, no_cardiac surgery patients received HBOC_201 to a maximum of 7 units (n = 83) or RBCs (n = 77). Patients could be switched to RBCs for safety or any other reason. The efficacy end points were elimination and/or reduction of allogeneic RBC transfusions for 28 days. Results: The proportion of patients in the HBOC_201 group that avoided RBC transfusion was 0.427 (95% confidence interval, 0.321_0.533). Subjects in the HBOC_201 group received on average 3.2 units of RBCs versus 4.4 units in the control arm (P = 0.004).

Background: DJBL treatment has been proven effective for treatment of obesity and T2DM. However, data on safety and efficacy of a 12_month DJBL treatment is limited. Methods: In 2014, our research group reported on a multicenter randomized clinical trial. Patients were randomized to DJBL or dietary treatment (control group). Twenty_eight patients crossed over after their dietary treatment and received up to 12 months of DJBL treatment. Patient visits were conducted at baseline, during DJBL treatment (1 week, 1Ð6, 9, 12 months) and 6 months after removal of the liner. Patients underwent a standard physical examination, blood sampling, assessment of adverse events, nutritional and diabetes counseling, and a standardized meal tolerance test. Results: Of the 28 patients included in this study, 24 patients completed 6 months of treatment. Eighteen patients were extended to 12 months of DJBL treatment; 13 patients completed this treatment period. After 6 months of DJBL treatment, a significant increase in excess weight loss (EWL) and decrease in weight, BMI, HbA1c, fasting glucose, cholesterol, HDL and LDL improved significantly. After 12 months of DJBL treatment, these parameters stabilized. Conclusions: The DJBL is an effective, minimally invasive treatment option. Even after successful treatment with dietary restrictions, the DJBL is still capable of significantly reducing weight and improving cardiovascular and type 2 diabetes mellitus parameters in obese patients."

However, little is known about the effectiveness and safety of the OIB outside clinical trials, and since approval, the Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings to health care providers about risk of balloon hyperinflation requiring early removal, pancreatitis, and death. We analyzed data on patients who have received the OIB since its approval to determine its safety, effectiveness, and tolerance in real-world clinical settings., METHODS: We performed a postregulatory approval study of the safety and efficacy of the OIB, and factors associated with intolerance and response. We collected data from the Mayo Clinic's database of patient demographics, outcomes of OIB placement (weight loss, weight-related comorbidities), technical aspects of insertion and removal, and adverse events associated with the device and/or procedure, from 8 centers (3 academic, 5 private, 4 surgeons, and 4 gastroenterologists). Our final analysis comprised 321 patients (mean age, 48.1 +/- 11.9 y; 80% female; baseline body mass index, 37.6 +/- 6.9). Exploratory multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of success and early balloon removal. Primary effectiveness outcomes were percentage of total body weight lost at 3, 6, and 9 months. Primary and secondary safety outcomes were rates of early balloon removal, periprocedural complications, dehydration episodes requiring intravenous infusion, balloon migration, balloon deflation or hyperinflation, pancreatitis, or other complications., RESULTS: Four patients had contraindications for placement at the time of endoscopy. The balloon was safely removed in all instances with an early removal rate (before 6 months) in 16.7% of patients, at a median of 8 weeks after placement (range, 1-6 mo). Use of selective serotonin or serotonin-norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors at the time of balloon placement was associated with increased odds of removal before 6 months (odds ratio, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.24-12.41). Total body weight lost at 3 months was 8.5% +/- 4.9% (n = 204), at 6 months was 11.8% +/- 7.5% (n = 199), and at 9 months was 13.3% +/- 10% (n = 47). At 6 months, total body weight losses of 5%, 10%, and 15% were achieved by 88%, 62%, and 31% of patients, respectively. Number of follow-up visits and weight loss at 3 months were associated with increased weight loss at 6 months (beta = 0.5 and 1.2, respectively) (P < .05). Mean levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, and hemoglobin A1c, as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure, were significantly improved at 6 months after OIB placement (P < .05)., CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of a database of patients who received endoscopic placement of the OIB, we found it to be safe, effective at inducing weight loss, and to reduce obesity-related comorbidities in a real-world clinical population. Rates of early removal (before 8 weeks) did not differ significantly between clinical trials and the real-world population, but were affected by use of medications. Copyright © 2018 AGA Institute.

Results: The successful intubation rate was 100[%] for both groups. In group F: 20.5[%] of patients required use of alternative maneuver (mandibular traction) to achieve intubation versus 5.1[%] in group A (p < 0.05). The time to achieve tracheal intubation with flexible fiberscope was: 78.9 ± 60.6 sec, and the Airtraq ¨ device: 30.7 ± 20.9 sec (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that tracheal intubation with the Airtraq ¨ device is achieved endowith less time and less use of alternative maneuvers, when compared with flexible fiberoptic in morbidly obese patients with anticipated difficult airway during anesthesia for bariatric surgery."

Data for participants (n=37) with bariatric surgery after diabetes onset were assessed before and after surgery and also compared to a matched control group. Data for participants who reported the use of FDA-approved weight loss medications (n=483) were assessed before starting, during use, and after stopping the medications and also compared to a matched control group. Variables of interest included BMI, HbA1c, blood pressure, lipid profile, rates of acute complications. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models., RESULTS: Bariatric surgery resulted in BMI reduction from 38.8+/-9.1kg/m2 to 33.3+/-6.7kg/m2 (P=0.006) and HbA1c reduction from 8.8+/-1.3% (73+/-14.2mmol/mol) to 8.1+/-1.1% (65+/-12.0mmol/mol) (P=0.05). Weight loss medications were not associated with weight loss or better glycemic control although stopping liraglutide favored weight gain. Both interventions were not associated with a significant change in blood pressure or lipid profile. There were no adverse events associated with the use of weight loss medications., CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery is effective for weight loss and may improve glycemic control in selected patients. Weight loss medications are not associated with diabetes improvement. A trial with liraglutide may be attempted for weight control, but weight loss medications in general do not show a significant effect. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

It can be hypothesized that self_control by eHealth could enhance clinical outcomes such as more weight loss and comorbidity reduction. The beneficial value of incorporating eHealth applications as standard postoperative care is yet to be established. In our hospital we provide all patients with eLearnings, informative media and interpatient communication using BePATIENT online platform. Objectives: To assess the value of eHealth by comparing different levels of telehealth provided to bariatric patients. Methods: Preoperative bariatric surgery patients (n=200) are stratified in three groups using randomization: (I) standard quality of care (n=100); (II) standard care + online eHealth platform (n=50); (III) standard care + online platform + self_monitoring devices, which can measure weight, blood pressure, oxygen saturation and physical activity. Body Mass Index (BMI) are registered monthly up to 2 years postoperatively. Results: Up till 1st of March 2017 a total of 20 patients haven been included. 12 patients are planned for/underwent sleeve gastrectomy and 8 for gastric bypass. 7 patients are allocated to group (I), 7 to (II) and 6 to (III). 8 additional contact were necessary for instructing usage of device. 83% of the requested measurements have been performed. Median time spent on the website per month in both the device and access group is 32 minutes (±8). Conclusion: Willingness is high and the majority of requested measurement is delivered, although follow_up is too short for other comparisons yet."
V. Vidal	Haemorrhoid embolisation	2017	10.1007/s00270-017-1725-y	CN-01418821	"Learning Objectives 1. To learn about the principles and concepts of haemorrhoid embolisation 2. To learn about the results and outcomes of haemorrhoid embolisation 3. To learn about potential complications of haemorrhoid embolisation and how to avoid them Hemorrhoidal disease is the most common anorectal condition, with a prevalence of 4%_35%. One of its main chronic symptoms is rectal bleeding. Its recurrence can alter the quality of life and can, more rarely, cause anemia. Pain is less common, occurring only in the event of a complication (congestive exacerbation, external hemorrhoidal thrombosis, and fissures). The most common treatment involves hygiene and dietary measures, phlebotonics, and/or nonsurgical outpatient treatment (infrared photocoagulation and elastic band ligation). The hemorrhoidal arteriovenous network is a normal vascular formation. There is a clear distinction between the external hemorrhoidal network below the dentate line (under the skin of the anal margin dependent on the pudendal artery, which is a branch of the inferior rectal artery) and the internal hemorrhoidal network located in the upper part of the anal canal above the dentate line (in the submucosal space depending on the superior rectal artery). Internal hemorrhoids are now considered to result from an increase in arterial blood flow from the superior rectal artery into the hemorrhoidal cushion (corpus cavernosum recti) (1). The replacement of muscle tissue by connective tissue causes an expansion of the vascular network of the anorectal submucosa, initiating a negative vicious circle of progressive vascular dilation and venous insufficiency leading to hemorrhoidal hyperplasia. This hyperplasia causes an increase in blood pressure, arterial inflow, and anal pressure in the corpus cavernosum recti. The lower part of the rectum and the anal canal are known to be supplied with blood by the inferior and middle rectal arteries, both of which have origins (pudendal artery and iliac network, respectively) at some distance from the inferior mesenteric artery (2). By contrast, the mechanical function of the corpus cavernosum recti is dependent on the influx of arterial blood from the branches (superior rectal arteries) of the inferior mesenteric artery. Ten years ago, proctologists developed a new type of treatment: elective transanal Doppler_guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation (DG_HAL). DG_HAL technique involves the identification and ligation of the superior rectal arteries under transanal Doppler guidance. The ligation of the superior rectal arteries provides a significant reduction in the arterial blood flow to the hemorrhoid and is effective in treating hemorrhoidal disease (3). It was feasible that this technique could be compatible with embolization. Thus, we have previously reported that arterial ligation can be performed with coils in the terminal branches of the superior rectal arteries via the endovascular route (4). The advantages of Emborrhoid and DG_HAL techniques over surgery are that it maintains the hemorrhoidal tissue in place, preserves anal continence without rectal wounds (no local care), causes significantly less pain, and avoids the complications of open surgery, thus allowing a faster return to activity. ÒEmborrhoidÓ embolization is performed using the right femoral route. The inferior mesenteric artery is catheterized using a Simmons catheter. The superior rectal arteries are then catheterized using a microcatheter. Coils used for the embolization are 0.018_inch long, with 2_3 mm in diameter. Technical success of the Emborrhoid technique has been reported in up to 90% of patients. Clinical success of the Emborrhoid technique has been reported in 74%_83% of patients with no complications (2, 5). The main advantages of the Emborrhoid technique are as follows: Patients feel absolutely no pain. No major complication, especially no ischemic or continence complication, is related to the Emborrhoid technique. This technique is available for outpatients. Patient can return to activity the day after e bolization. Embolization allows a complementary treatment if essential. The technique can be easily performed within an hour. Endovascular treatment offers many benefits, including the complete visualization of all branches of superior rectal arteries and anastomoses with middle and inferior rectal arteries (6). Using the DG_HAL technique, all arteries may not be detected, which can lead to incomplete treatment especially if anastomoses are present. Embolization eliminates the risk of direct anorectal trauma. The results of our previous study (7) have confirmed the favorable clinical results of previous studies and have also objectively demonstrated that at 1 month after embolization, hemorrhoidal bundles significantly decrease in size; that embolization particles do not cause ischemia in histology; and that the sphincter exhibits a normal physiology 1 month after embolization. We hypothesized that embolization is more effective with particles because they cause a more distal hemorrhoidal plexus embolization, thereby restricting the superior rectal arteries reloads by the middle rectal arteries. A randomized controlled study is warranted for confirming the benefits of this technique. Many patients suffer from hemorrhoids but do not complain to physicians because they do not wish to have an endorectal treatment. We believe that if a pain_free treatment for this condition is offered to outpatients, more patients will seek treatment. Given the preliminary results reported in our studies, we believe that there is sufficient evidence to include embolization in therapeutic options for patients with bleeding related to hemorrhoidal disease. We have demonstrated that distal coil embolization of superior rectal arteries to stop chronic bleeding is safe and effective. The results of our previous study (7) have demonstrated that embolization of superior rectal arteries with particles does not lead to ischemia. Particle embolization leads to more distal embolization of the hemorrhoidal plexus, lower than the anastomoses with the middle rectal arteries. New embolic agents may provide an opportunity for the development of the Emborrhoid technique."

Changes in BMI, HbA1c, insulin requirements, evolution of comorbidities, and microvascular complications were registered annually after surgery., RESULTS: Percentage of total weight loss (%TWL) 12 months after surgery was 30.4 +/- 9.2 % and at 5 years, it decreased to 28.1 +/- 11.5 % (p = 0.02). HbA1c was reduced during the first year from 8.5 +/- 1.3 to 7.9 +/- 1.4 %, p = 0.016. In the long-term, HbA1c returned to baseline values. There was a sustained reduction of 51 % in total daily insulin dose, and the decrease in the number of patients with hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea was 42.8, 25, and 66 %, respectively. Retinopathy remained mainly unaffected, and 25 % of patients with microalbuminuria regressed to normoalbuminuria., CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery in patients with T1DM mainly provides benefits of weight reduction, on insulin requirements, obesity comorbidities, and some benefits in diabetes complications, but might have only minimal effect on the glycemic control in the long term.

In 1999, a prospective trial was started at our institution to evaluate the effectiveness of BIBP. Trial was interrupted in 2006 due to high rate of complications. The aim of the present paper was to retrospectively review 10-year outcomes of BIBP., METHODS: Retrospective review of bariatric database was performed to find patients that had undergone BIBP from 1999 to 2006. Data collected were as follows: age, gender, body weight, body mass index (BMI), percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL), remission from weight-related diseases, complications, and deaths at 1,3, 5, 7, and 10 years. Quality of life was evaluated using ""BAROS"" questionnaire., RESULTS: From May 1999 to September 2006, 86 patients underwent BIBP. The mean age was 34.9 +/- 22.4 years, and the initial weight and BMI were 141.2 +/- 40.4 kg and 49.8 +/- 15.5 kg/m2, respectively. After 10 years, the mean %EWL and BMI were 72.6 +/- 18.7 and 31.2 +/- 5.6 kg/m2. Almost all patients had diarrhea after surgery. Bloating syndrome occurred in 24% of patients, 48% had nephrolithiasis, and 20.9% had cholelithiasis. Remission from diabetes and hypertension was obtained in 75% and 80% of patients. Mortality was 3.2% and reoperation rate was 14.5%., CONCLUSIONS: Malabsorption plays a determinant role to obtain a long-lasting treatment for obese patients. However, BIBP is not recommendable due to high rate of complications and metabolic disorders."

The prognosis of HFPEF is comparable to that of systolic heart failure, but without any specific or effective treatment. This review presents a biomathematically corrected diagnostic approach for quantification of diastolic dysfunction (DD) via the age dependency of diastolic function. Pathophysiological mechanisms for DD in the cardiometabolic syndrome (CMS) are mainly based on downstream effects of IR including insufficient myocardial energy supply. The second section discusses therapeutic strategies for the control and therapy of CMS, IR, and the associated DD/HFPEF with a focus on dietary therapy that is independent of weight loss but improves all manifestations of the CMS and reduces cardiovascular risk.Copyright © 2016, The Author(s)."

Its strong link with co-morbid conditions such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and depression presents an increasing strain on health care systems around the world. Diet and exercise alone has been shown to be largely ineffective at managing obesity. Surgery is the only evidence-based method of allowing morbidly obese patients to lose weight and to maintain this weight loss. Weight-reduction in obese individuals from bariatric surgery has also been found to markedly improve obesity-related co-morbid conditions, particularly, type 2-diabetes. Diabetic remission from bariatric surgery has resulted in the inclusion of bariatric surgery, by the International Diabetes Taskforce, as a treatment modality for type-2 diabetes. This consensus statement named four surgical options that have been found to be effective in both weight-loss and in inducing diabetes remission. These four surgical procedures lead to weight-loss through restrictive and malabsorptive mechanisms. Each specific operation has a different level of efficacy in inducing weight-loss and diabetic remission, as well as distinct types and rates of complications. This article reviews the best evidence that exists for the effectiveness and complications of these four operations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

It is now recognized that these patients have myriad of important co-morbidities (e.g., diabetes, hypothyroidism and metabolic syndrome). The workup of patients with suspected NAFLD should consist of excluding competing etiologies and systemic evaluation of metabolic comorbidities. NAFLD is histologically categorized into steatosis and steatohepatitis, two states with fairly dichotomous natural history. While significant progress has been made in terms of noninvasively predicting advanced fibrosis, insufficient progress has been made in predicting steatohepatitis. Currently, liver biopsy remains the gold standard for the histological stratification of NAFLD. While sustained weight loss can be effective to treat NASH, it is often difficult to achieve. Foregut bariatric surgery can be quite effective in improving hepatic histology in selected patients without liver failure or significant portal hypertension. Thiazolidinediones have shown promise and the results from the ongoing, large multicenter study should become available soon. Large multicenter studies of CB, receptor anatagonists are also underway but their results will not be available for several years. Several recent studies have highlighted that cardiovascular disease is the single most important cause of morbidity and mortality in this patient population., CONCLUSION: Health care providers should not only focus on liver disease but also concentrate on aggressively modifying and treating their cardiovascular risk factors."

Compared to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, mini gastric bypass is a technically simpler and reversible procedure. However, comparative outcomes of the effectiveness between Mini gastric bypass and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass remain unclear., METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane library from inception to February 9, 2018. For assessment of method quality, NOS (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale) and Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias were used for cohort study and randomized controlled trials, respectively. The meta-analysis was performed by RevMan 5.3 software., RESULTS: 10 cohort studies and 1 randomized controlled trial was included in our meta-analysis. The method quality of the 10 cohort studies was proved as high quality according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The randomized controlled trial was proved to have a low risk of bias according to Cochrane Collaboration's assessment. Patients receiving mini-gastric bypass had multiple advantageous indexes as compared with patients receiving Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Examples include: a higher 1-year EWL% (P<0.05), higher 2-year EWL% (P<0.05), higher type 2 diabetes mellitus remission rate, as well as a shorter operation time (P<0.05). No significant statistical difference was observed in hypertension remission rate, mortality, leakage rate, GERD rate, or hospital stay between mini gastric bypass and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass., CONCLUSION: Mini gastric bypass seems to be a simpler procedure with a better weight reduction effect. This seems to also be the case regarding remission rates of type 2 diabetes mellitus when using Mini gastric bypass in comparison to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. A small sample size and biased data may have influenced the stability of our results. In light of this, surgeons should treat our results in a conservative way. Larger sample size and multi-center randomized control trials are needed to compare the effectiveness and safety between mini-gastric bypass and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Copyright © 2018.

Yet, the emergence of cardiometabolic comorbidities in this population may impact long-term outcomes including the quality of life and lifespan. Obesity is a major driver of cardiometabolic disorders in the general population, and in ALL patients it is associated with increased risk of hypertension, dysglycemia, and febrile neutropenia when compared with lean ALL patients undergoing therapy. This systematic review aims to assess the current evidence for bariatric interventions to manage obesity in children with ALL. The primary outcome for this systematic review was the change in BMI z-score with implementation of the interventions studied. Literature searches were conducted in several databases. Ten publications addressing the study question were included in this review, and five studies were used in the meta-analysis to assess the impact of the bariatric interventions on obesity. The BMI z-score did not change significantly with the interventions. However, the quality of evidence was low, which precluded the recommendation of their use. In conclusion, prospective, rigorous, adequately powered, and high-quality longitudinal studies are urgently needed to deliver effective lifestyle interventions to children with ALL to treat and prevent obesity. These interventions, if successful, may improves cardiometabolic health outcomes and enhance the quality of life and life expectancy in children with ALL."

Glucose-lipid metabolism and inflammation were measured. A total of 115 patients with obesity (NP, n = 64; HP, n = 51) underwent LSG were recruited, and PRL was measured at 12 months after LSG., RESULTS: (1) Blood glucose (BG), total cholesterol (TCH), LDL, triglyceride, and TNF-alpha were lower in the HP than in the NP group in the cross-sectional study (all P < 0.05). (2) PRL was negatively associated with neck circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, basal metabolism rate (BMR), ALP, TCH, and LDL in all subjects. PRL levels were positively associated with weight, HC, and BMR in males but were negatively associated with ALT, AST, ALP, BG 30 min, BG 60 min, FFA, and TCH in females (all P < 0.05). (3) Regression analysis showed that PRL negatively correlated with ALP and LDL-C in the whole baseline (beta = - 0.051, P = 0.002; beta = - 1.372, P = 0.033). PRL was a negative factor for ALP in females and a positive factor for BMR2 in males (beta = - 0.099, P = 0.041; beta = 0.005, P = 0.006). (4) PRL decreased in the HP group and increased in the NP group at 12 months post-operation (all P < 0.05). Increased PRL was associated with a change in TCH in the NP group (P < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Increased PRL resulted in improved glucose-lipid metabolism and chronic low-grade inflammation. LSG led to increased PRL in NP and decreased PRL in HP. Improved lipid was associated with increased PRL in NP after surgery., CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR-OCS-12002381."

Clavien"	Laparoscopic gastric bypass is superior to laparoscopic gastric banding for treatment of morbid obesity	2004			"OBJECTIVE: To define whether laparoscopic gastric banding or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass represents the better approach to treat patients with morbid obesity., SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Two techniques, laparoscopic gastric bypass or gastric banding, are currently widely used to treat morbid obesity. Since both procedures offer certain advantages, a strong controversy exists as to which operation should be proposed to these patients. Therefore, data are urgently needed to identify the best therapy., METHODS: Since randomized trials are most likely not feasible because of the highly different invasiveness and irreversibility of these procedures, a matched-pair design of a large prospectively collected database appears to be the best method. Therefore, we used our prospective database including 678 bariatric procedures performed at our institution since 1995. A total of 103 consecutive patients with laparoscopic gastric bypass were randomly matched to 103 patients with laparoscopic gastric banding according to age, body mass index, and gender., RESULTS: Both groups were comparable regarding age, gender, body mass index, excessive weight, fat mass, and comorbidites such as diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension. Feasibility and safety: All gastric banding procedures were performed laparoscopically, and one gastric bypass operation had to be converted to an open procedure. Mean operating time was 145 minutes for gastric banding and 190 minutes for gastric bypass (P < 0.001). Hospital stay was 3.3 days for gastric banding and 8.4 days for gastric bypass. The incidence of early postoperative complications was not significantly different, but late complications were significantly more frequent in the gastric banding group (pouch dilatation). There was no mortality in both groups. Efficiency: Body mass index decreased from 48.0 to 36.8 kg/m in the gastric banding group and from 47.8 to 31.9 kg/m in the gastric bypass group within 2 years of surgery. These differences became significant from the first postoperative month until the end of the follow-up (24 months). The gastric bypass procedure achieved a significantly better reduction of comorbidities., CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic gastric banding and laparoscopic gastric bypass are feasible and safe. Pouch dilatations after gastric banding are responsible for more late complications compared with the gastric bypass. Laparoscopic gastric bypass offers a significant advantage regarding weight loss and reduction of comorbidities after surgery. Therefore, in our hands, laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass appears to be the therapy of choice."

In this prospective, randomised crossover trial, we included patients with a body mass index (BMI) >25 and <35 kg.m(-2) , and , age >18 years, undergoing elective surgery in the supine position with an expected duration of surgery <2 h. Leakage pressures, insertion difficulty, time and number of insertion attempts were evaluated. We included 50 patients consisting of 29 mildly (BMI>25 and < 30 kg.mg(-2) ) and 21 moderately (BMI>30 and < 35 kg.mg(-2) ) obese patients. Mean (SD) leakage pressures were 23.7 (9.2) cmH2O (i-gel) and 17.4 (7.0) cmH2O (LMA-Unique) (p<0.01). Subgroup analyses showed leakage pressures of 22.2 (9.4) cmH2O (i-gel) and 17.5 (7.5) cmH2O (LMA-Unique) (p=0.013) in the mild subgroup, and 25.7 (8.6) cmH2O (i-gel) and 17.0 (6.2) cmH2O (LMA-Unique) (p<0.01), in the moderate subgroup. Insertion of the i-gel was associated with significantly higher leakage pressures compared with the LMA-Unique in mildly and moderately obese patients. Copyright © 2011 The Authors.

To address this, we collated diabetes outcomes more than a decade after laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) surgery., METHOD: Clinical and biochemical measures from 113 obese T2D patients who underwent LAGB surgery in 2003 and 2004 were analyzed. Diabetes remission was defined as HbA1c < 6.2% (44 mmol/mol) and fasting glucose < 7.0 mmol/L., RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients had weight data at 10 years and attained a median [Q1, Q3] weight loss of 16 [10, 21] percent. Sixty patients attended a follow-up assessment. Their baseline HbA1c of 7.8 [7.1, 9.3] percentage units (62 [54, 78] mmol/mol) had decreased to 6.6 [6.1, 8.4] (49 [43, 68] mmol/mol) despite no significant change in glucose-lowering therapy. Eleven patients (18%) were in diabetes remission and another 18 had HbA1c <= 6.5%. Significant improvements in physical measures of quality of life, blood pressure, and lipid profile were also observed but there was no change in the proportion of patients with albuminuria and a significant decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate. Twelve patients in the follow-up cohort (20%) required anti-reflux medication after surgery and 26 (43%) underwent gastric band revision surgery., CONCLUSION: Weight loss for over 10 years after LAGB surgery delivers clinically meaningful improvements in HbA1c, blood pressure, lipids, and quality of life at the cost of a high rate of revision surgery and increased use of anti-reflux medication. These findings support the use of bariatric surgery as a long-term treatment for weight loss and wellbeing in patients with T2D., STUDY REGISTRATION: Registered with the Australian Clinical trials registry as ACTRN12615000089538."

Estimates of cost-effectiveness were calculated based on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for different treatment scenarios. Costs were inflated to 2015 U.S. dollar values and an ICER of less than $50,000 per QALY gained was considered cost-effective., RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for GB surgery at two years exceeded $90,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained but decreased to $52,000, $29,000 and $22,000 when the health benefits of surgery were assumed to endure for 5, 10 and 15 years respectively. The cost-effectiveness of GB surgery was sensitive to utility gained from weight loss and, to a lesser degree, the costs of GB surgery. However, the cost-effectiveness of GB surgery was affected minimally by improvements in HbA1c, systolic blood pressure and cholesterol., CONCLUSIONS: GB surgery for overweight but not obese people with T2D appears to be cost-effective in the U.S. setting if weight loss endures for more than five years. Health utility gained from weight loss is a critical input to cost-effectiveness estimates and therefore should be routinely measured in populations undergoing bariatric surgery.

We aimed to identify whether laparoscopic adjustable gastric band surgery can improve glucose control in people with type 2 diabetes who were overweight but not obese. METHODS: We did an open_label, parallel_group, randomised controlled trial between Nov 1, 2009, and June 30, 2013, at one centre in Melbourne, Australia. Patients aged 18_65 years with type 2 diabetes and a BMI between 25 and 30 kg/m2 were randomly assigned (1:1), by computer_generated random sequence, to receive either multidisciplinary diabetes care plus laparoscopic adjustable gastric band surgery or multidisciplinary diabetes care alone. The primary outcome was diabetes remission 2 years after randomisation, defined as glucose concentrations of less than 7.0 mmol/L when fasting and less than 11.1 mmol/L 2 h after 75 g oral glucose, at least two days after stopping glucose_lowering drugs. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12609000286246. FINDINGS: 51 patients were randomised to the multidisciplinary care plus gastric band group (n=25) or the multidisciplinary care only group (n=26), of whom 23 participants and 25 participants, respectively, completed follow_up to 2 years. 12 (52%) participants in the multidisciplinary care plus gastric band group and two (8%) participants in the multidisciplinary care only group achieved diabetes remission (difference in proportions 0.44, 95% CI 0.17_0.71; p=0.0012). One (4%) participant in the gastric band group needed revisional surgery and four others (17%) had a total of five episodes of food intolerance due to excessive adjustment of the band. INTERPRETATION: When added to multidisciplinary care, laparoscopic adjustable gastric band surgery for overweight people with type 2 diabetes improves glycaemic control with an acceptable adverse event profile. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric band surgery is a reasonable treatment option for this population. FUNDING: Monash University Centre for Obesity Research and Education and Allergan."

Reductions in glucocorticoid metabolism are associated with improvements in IIH disease activity. The basal IIH glucocorticoid metabolism is yet to be assessed. Objective(s): The objective of this study was to determine the basal glucocorticoid phenotype in IIH and assess the effects of weight loss on the IIH glucocorticoid phenotype. Design(s): A retrospective case-control study and a separate exploratory analysis of a prospective randomized intervention study were carried out. Method(s): The case-control study compared female IIH patients to BMI, age, and sex-matched controls. In the randomized intervention study, different IIH patients were randomized to either a community weight management intervention or bariatric surgery, with patients assessed at baseline and 12 months. Glucocorticoid levels were determined utilizing 24-h urinary steroid profiles alongside the measurement of adipose tissue 11beta-HSD1 activity. Result(s): Compared to control subjects, patients with active IIH had increased systemic 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11beta-HSD1) and 5alpha-reductase activity. The intervention study demonstrated that weight loss following bariatric surgery reduced systemic 11beta-HSD1 and 5alpha-reductase activity. Reductions in these were associated with reduced ICP. Subcutaneous adipose tissue explants demonstrated elevated 11beta-HSD1 activity compared to samples from matched controls. Conclusion(s): The study demonstrates that in IIH, there is a phenotype of elevated systemic and adipose 11beta-HSD1 activity in excess to that mediated by obesity. Bariatric surgery to induce weight loss was associated with reductions in 11beta-HSD1 activity and decreased ICP. These data reflect new insights into the IIH phenotype and further point toward metabolic dysregulation as a feature of IIH.Copyright © 2022 The authors Published by Bioscientifica Ltd."
S. Wharton	Current Perspectives on Long-term Obesity Pharmacotherapy	2016	https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcjd.2015.07.005		"Approximately 1 in 4 adult Canadians are obese and, thus, are at an elevated risk for developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and other conditions. Current treatment guidelines recommend that obese individuals lose 5% to 10% of their starting weights to minimize the risk factors for cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk for developing type 2 diabetes or hypertension. All obesity-management strategies involve lifestyle management, but few patients will lose a significant amount of weight and manage to keep it off over the long term using just this strategy. Bariatric surgery is associated with significant long-term weight loss but is restricted to subjects with very high body mass indices, who often wait many years to undergo the procedure. Recent breakthroughs in understanding the mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of elevated body fat have led to the arrival of new obesity pharmacotherapies. These novel antiobesity therapies, which work by reducing energy intake or through increasing satiety, decreasing hunger, or reducing absorption of calories, may be used indefinitely once patients have demonstrated significant responses (usually defined as >=5% weight loss) over the first 12 weeks of treatment. To date, 2 long-term obesity pharmacotherapies have been approved and are available in Canada: liraglutide and orlistat. Here, I summarize the mechanisms and clinical features of medications for long-term obesity management that are available in Canada, as well as those available in other jurisdictions or are currently in development.Copyright © 2016."
C. Wickman and H. Kramer	Obesity and kidney disease: potential mechanisms	2013	https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.semnephrol.2012.12.006		"Assessment of adiposity should include measurements of both body mass index and waist circumference. The prevalence of obesity, based on a body mass index of 30 kg/m(2) or greater, has increased substantially over the past 2 decades in Western societies. Obesity remains the number one preventable risk factor for chronic kidney disease because obesity largely mediates diabetes and hypertension, the 2 most common etiologies for end-stage kidney disease. However, obesity itself likely has independent effects on renal hemodynamics and individuals with a low number of nephrons are likely to be the most susceptible to these changes. Multiple mechanisms have been postulated whereby obesity directly impacts kidney disease including hyperfiltration, increased glomerular capillary wall tension, and podocyte stress. Weight loss reduces glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow along with proteinuria, but these changes are most notable after bariatric surgery in adults with morbid obesity. Aside from adiposity itself, the high caloric intake that leads to obesity also may heighten chronic kidney disease risk via the circuitous loop between Sirt1 and adiponectin and podocyte effacement. Sirt1 is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide+dependent deacteylase that is up-regulated in the setting of caloric restriction. Sirt1 expression modulates adiponectin levels that in turn appear to influence podocyte effacement. Clinical trials are needed to assess the benefits and risks of intentional weight loss on kidney disease measures and progression. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

The current study analysed large-scale population studies to assess the association of bariatric surgery with long-term mortality and incidence of new-onset obesity-related disease at a national level., METHODS AND FINDINGS: A systematic literature search of Medline (via PubMed), Embase, and Web of Science was performed. Articles were included if they were national or regional administrative database cohort studies reporting comparative risk of long-term mortality or incident obesity-related diseases for patients who have undergone any form of bariatric surgery compared with an appropriate control group with a minimum follow-up period of 18 months. Meta-analysis of hazard ratios (HRs) was performed for mortality risk, and pooled odds ratios (PORs) were calculated for discrete variables relating to incident disease. Eighteen studies were identified as suitable for inclusion. There were 1,539,904 patients included in the analysis, with 269,818 receiving bariatric surgery and 1,270,086 control patients. Bariatric surgery was associated with a reduced rate of all-cause mortality (POR 0.62, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.69, p < 0.001) and cardiovascular mortality (POR 0.50, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.71, p < 0.001). Bariatric surgery was strongly associated with reduced incidence of T2DM (POR 0.39, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.83, p = 0.010), hypertension (POR 0.36, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.40, p < 0.001), dyslipidaemia (POR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.80, p = 0.010), and ischemic heart disease (POR 0.46, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.73, p = 0.001). Limitations of the study include that it was not possible to account for unmeasured variables, which may not have been equally distributed between patient groups given the non-randomised design of the studies included. There was also heterogeneity between studies in the nature of the control group utilised, and potential adverse outcomes related to bariatric surgery were not specifically examined due to a lack of available data., CONCLUSIONS: This pooled analysis suggests that bariatric surgery is associated with reduced long-term all-cause mortality and incidence of obesity-related disease in patients with obesity for the whole operated population. The results suggest that broader access to bariatric surgery for people with obesity may reduce the long-term sequelae of this disease and provide population-level benefits."

Finer	Weight management and cardiovascular disease: Implications of recent and ongoing clinical trials	2008	https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1474651408094587		"Obesity is a global issue with increasing evidence that overweight and obesity are associated with a higher chronic disease risk. Despite over 10 years of government recognition of a need to develop and implement effective prevention strategies, all age groups are getting fatter with overweight becoming the 'norm'. Modest weight loss reduces many of the risk factors that accompany obesity, notably type 2 diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemia. Adherence to lifestyle changes required to achieve these improvements is poor and progressively more weight-loss medications are used as adjunctive therapy, while bariatric surgery is performed for the severely obese. Currently available pharmacotherapy shows encouraging benefits in clinical trials but remains unproven as an effective strategy to support long-term weight loss and weight maintenance and for translation of improved surrogate risk markers into fewer cardiovascular events and a longer life.

Weight loss through lifestyle interventions, pharmacotherapy and/or bariatric surgery improves CV risk factors. Cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) of anti-obesity medications aim to evaluate the CV safety and benefits of pharmacotherapy. Many CVOTs in obesity have either failed to demonstrate a CV benefit or have been terminated prematurely because of safety issues, prompting regulatory agencies to define new requirements (based on those for CVOTs in type 2 diabetes [T2D]). CVOTs of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) in T2D have demonstrated that some GLP-1RAs reduce CV risk and may help inform future CVOTs in obesity, given the approval of liraglutide 3.0 mg for obesity. In this review, the evidence for the link between obesity and CVD is considered in the context of studies showing that weight loss improves markers of CV risk and risk of adverse CV events. The review also examines the CVOTs in obesity that have been conducted to date and those under way, such as the SELECT trial with subcutaneous semaglutide of 2.4 mg. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

Even with this input pharmaceutical interventions may be required in addition to lifestyle changes to prevent serious complications of morbid obesity. However orlistat is currently the only licensed medication. In a recent double blind randomised controlled trial, liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonist along side lifestyle interventions was shown to be associated with beneficial BMI reduction in children and adolescents. We present a morbidly obese adolescent with life threating obstructive hypoventilation who had dramatic weight loss of 45.3kg in a 12 month period following treatment with liraglutide. Method(s): A 15year old boy with morbid obesity, 184.5kg (BMI 56.6kg/m2, SDS +3.23) presented with symptoms suggestive of sleep apnoea. The sleep study showed average oxygen saturation of 87% with an oxygen desaturation index of 56.4 consistent with significant obstructive sleep apnoea. He was established on non-invasive ventilator support [overnight continuous positive airway pressure] and was referred to the obesity team. The clinical history was not suggestive of an underlying monogenic cause of obesity with no neurodevelopmental problems. He was not on any medications. His clinical examination showed generalised obesity, without dysmorphism, signs of insulin resistance or cushingoid features. His investigations showed normal HbA1C (36mmol/mol), liver function, thyroid function and oral glucose tolerance test. An echo cardiogram showed no evidence of pulmonary hypertension. A Calorie restricted diet (1800 kcal/day) was advised along with goal setting exercise. He was commenced on orlistat 120mg, three times daily but stopped taking them due to side effects. He was referred for bariatric surgery as he had a significant obesity related co-morbidity but a decision was made to review him when he completes his growth and sexual maturation. Liraglutide, although not approved to be used in children and adolescents for weight management, was commenced in order to buy time before the bariatric surgery. He was commenced at a dose of 0.6mg. The dose was progressively increased to 1.8mg and was not further increased as the patient was reporting side effects of nausea and vomiting. Result(s): A significant reduction of weight from 183.5 kg to 139.2kg was observed in a 12 month period with a 25% reduction in BMI from 56.6kg/m2 (SDS +3.23) to 42.5kg/m2 (SDS +2.87) and a reduction in BMI SDS score of-0.36. The patient continues on CPAP and is motivated to continue weight loss. Conclusion(s): Liraglutide is currently not licensed to manage obesity in children and adolescents without diabetes. As there is emerging evidence from clinical trials supporting the use of liraglutide in adolescents with severe obesity, it should be considered as a potential treatment option. Liraglutide can have an effect along with dietary and life style management especially in motivated patients and could potentially buy time in adolescents with morbid obesity awaiting bariatric surgery."

A highly reliable endoscopic leak test will be important for clinical NOTES procedures. Design: A prospective randomized controlled trial of contrast_based radiologic leak testing versus pressure_monitoring_based endoscopic leak testing. Methods: During the pre_trial phase, a system for the measurement of intragastric pressure was developed using a clinical hemodynamic blood pressure monitoring device and pressure transducer. In the trial phase, 40kg swine were block randomized to radiologic or endoscopic arms. All gastrotomies were created using a needle knife and an 18mm dilating balloon. In the radiologic arm, leak testing was assessed by pooling 120cc of dilute gastrograffin over the gastrotomy and obtaining abdominal radiographs in AP, lateral, and oblique views. Radiographic images were interpreted by a GI radiologist. After delineation in the pre_trial phase, no_leak in the endoscopic group was defined as a pressure ³ 15 mmHg during 120 sec of insufflation. If a leak was demonstrated, the gastrotomy was reclosed using a second generation prototype T_anchor system. At necropsy, peritoneal fluid analysis, histologic examination, and a water_fill test were also performed. Results: There were 59 total swine, 23 in the pre_trial phase and 36 in the randomized trial. Swine were survived for a mean of 9 days post_operatively. By total and max gastric pressure over 120 sec, endoscopic pressure monitoring demonstrated a reproducible change with insufflation (r=0.735, p<0.001 & r=0.769, p<0.000). In the post_peritoneoscopy state, there was a detectable and significant decrease in the mean total and mean max pressure versus baseline (p=0.006 & p=0.009). After endoscopic closure, there was no significant difference in mean total and mean max gastric pressures compared to baseline (p=0.480 & p=0.380). There was no significant difference between the radiologic and endoscopic arms in the detection of leaks (4/18 vs 3/18 p=0.500). Mean weight gain was equivalent (p=0.998). There was one operative abdominal wall injury and no deaths. There were no leaks by the water fill test at necropsy. Conclusion: In the largest randomized trial of natural orifice surgery to date, endoscopic gastric pressure monitoring demonstrated the presence of a gastric leak following NOTES procedures and was as reliable as contrast based radiology. This is the first randomized trial demonstrating the utility of an endoscopic pressure_based test for the detection of a gastric leak during natural orifice surgery."

Intra cellular vitamin D receptors and the 1-alpha hydroxylase enzyme are distributed ubiquitously in all tissues suggesting a multitude of functions of vitamin D. It plays an indirect but an important role in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism as reflected by its association with type 2 diabetes (T2D), metabolic syndrome, insulin secretion, insulin resistance, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and obesity. Peer-reviewed papers, related to the topic were extracted using key words, from PubMed, Medline, and other research databases. Correlations of vitamin D with diabetes, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome were examined for this evidence-based review. In addition to the well-studied musculoskeletal effects, vitamin D decreases the insulin resistance, severity of T2D, prediabetes, metabolic syndrome, inflammation, and autoimmunity. Vitamin D exerts autocrine and paracrine effects such as direct intra-cellular effects via its receptors and the local production of 1,25(OH)2D3, especially in muscle and pancreatic beta-cells. It also regulates calcium homeostasis and calcium flux through cell membranes, and activation of a cascade of key enzymes and cofactors associated with metabolic pathways. Cross-sectional, observational, and ecological studies reported inverse correlations between vitamin D status with hyperglycemia and glycemic control in patients with T2D, decrease the rate of conversion of prediabetes to diabetes, and obesity. However, no firm conclusions can be drawn from current studies, because (A) studies were underpowered; (B) few were designed for glycemic outcomes, (C) the minimum (or median) serum 25(OH) D levels achieved are not measured or reported; (D) most did not report the use of diabetes medications; (E) some trials used too little (F) others used too large, unphysiological and infrequent doses of vitamin D; and (G) relative paucity of rigorous clinical data on the effects of vitamin D sufficiency on non-calcium endpoints. Although a large number of observational studies support improving T2D, insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome with vitamin D adequacy, there is a lack of conclusive evidence from randomized control clinical trials that, these disorders are prevented following optimization of serum levels of 25(OH)D. However, none of the currently conducted clinical studies would resolve these issues. Thus, specifically designed, new clinical studies are needed to be conducted in well-defined populations, following normalizing the serum vitamin D levels in vitamin D deficient prediabetes subjects, to test the hypothesis that hypovitaminosis D worsens these disorders and correction would alleviate it.

Renal sympathetic denervation was thought to be a new method for the treatment for resistant hypertension. Early studies demonstrated a marked benefit in patients who underwent renal denervation procedures, but the pivotal SYMPLICITY 3-HTN trial, the only sham-controlled randomized trial performed, did not show a benefit for patients treated with the procedure compared to sham. There is still much to learn about the physiology and anatomy of renal sympathetic pathways as well as careful attention to medication adherence in order to understand the role of renal sympathetic denervation in treating hypertensive patients. While renal denervation technology remains available in clinical practice outside of the USA, we expect further development of this technology in the upcoming years and the continued evaluation of this technology in patients with hypertension as well as other disease states to fully understand its role.Copyright © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

The trial objective was to merge individual-patient data from two RCTs to compare outcomes after LSG and LRYGB., METHODS: Five-year outcomes of the Finnish SLEEVEPASS and Swiss SM-BOSS RCTs comparing LSG with LRYGB were analysed. Both original trials were designed to evaluate weight loss. Additional patient-level data on type 2 diabetes (T2DM), obstructive sleep apnoea, and complications were retrieved. The primary outcome was percentage excess BMI loss (%EBMIL). Secondary predefined outcomes in both trials included total weight loss, remission of co-morbidities, improvement in quality of life (QoL), and overall morbidity., RESULTS: At baseline, 228 LSG and 229 LRYGB procedures were performed. Five-year follow-up was available for 199 of 228 patients (87.3 per cent) after LSG and 199 of 229 (87.1 per cent) after LRYGB. Model-based mean estimate of %EBMIL was 7.0 (95 per cent c.i. 3.5 to 10.5) percentage points better after LRYGB than after LSG (62.7 versus 55.5 per cent respectively; P < 0.001). There was no difference in remission of T2DM, obstructive sleep apnoea or QoL improvement; remission for hypertension was better after LRYGB compared with LSG (60.3 versus 44.9 per cent; P = 0.049). The complication rate was higher after LRYGB than LSG (37.2 versus 22.5 per cent; P = 0.001), but there was no difference in mean Comprehensive Complication Index value (30.6 versus 31.0 points; P = 0.859)., CONCLUSION: Although LRYGB induced greater weight loss and better amelioration of hypertension than LSG, there was no difference in remission of T2DM, obstructive sleep apnoea, or QoL at 5 years. There were more complications after LRYGB, but the individual burden for patients with complications was similar after both operations. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

Route of Feeding as a Proxy for Dysphagia After Stroke and the Effect of Transdermal Glyceryl Trinitrate: data from the Efficacy of Nitric Oxide in Stroke Randomised Controlled Trial	2018	10.1007/s12975-017-0548-0	CN-01643458	"Post_stroke dysphagia is common, associated with poor outcome and often requires non_oral feeding/fluids. The relationship between route of feeding and outcome, as well as treatment with glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), was studied prospectively. The Efficacy of Nitric Oxide in Stroke (ENOS) trial assessed transdermal GTN (5 mg versus none for 7 days) in 4011 patients with acute stroke and high blood pressure. Feeding route (oral = normal or soft diet; non_oral = nasogastric tube, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube, parenteral fluids, no fluids) was assessed at baseline and day 7. The primary outcome was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) measured at day 90. At baseline, 1331 (33.2%) patients had non_oral feeding, were older, had more severe stroke and more were female, than 2680 (66.8%) patients with oral feeding. By day 7, 756 patients had improved from non_oral to oral feeding, and 119 had deteriorated. Non_oral feeding at baseline was associated with more impairment at day 7 (Scandinavian Stroke Scale 29.0 versus 43.7; 2p < 0.001), and worse mRS (4.0 versus 2.7; 2p < 0.001) and death (23.6 versus 6.8%; 2p = 0.014) at day 90. Although GTN did not modify route of feeding overall, randomisation ²6 h of stroke was associated with a move to more oral feeding at day 7 (odds ratio = 0.61, 95% confidence intervals 0.38, 0.98; 2p = 0.040). As a proxy for dysphagia, non_oral feeding is present in 33% of patients with acute stroke and associated with more impairment, dependency and death. GTN moved feeding route towards oral intake if given very early after stroke. Clinical Trial Registration Clinical Trial Registration_URL: http://www.controlled_trials.com .

In this randomised, blinded prospective study, 40 ml of atomised 1% (n = 11) or 2% (n = 10) lidocaine was administered with high oxygen flow as carrier. Outcomes included time for intubation, patient tolerance to airway manipulation, haemodynamic parameters, the bronchoscopist's overall satisfaction, and serial serum lidocaine concentrations. Patients receiving lidocaine 1% had a longer mean (SD) time from the start of topicalisation to tracheal tube cuff inflation than those receiving lidocaine 2% (8.6 (0.9) min vs 6.9 (0.5) min, respectively; p < 0.05). Patients in the 1% cohort demonstrated increased responses to airway manipulation (p < 0.0001), reflecting lower bronchoscopist's satisfaction scores (p < 0.03). Haemodynamic responses to topicalisation and airway manipulation were similar in both groups. Peak plasma concentration was lower in the 1% group (mean (SD) 1.4 (0.3) and 3.8 (0.5) microg.ml(-1), respectively; p < 0.001). Airway anaesthesia using atomised lidocaine for awake oral fibreoptic intubation in the morbidly obese is efficacious, rapid and safe. Compared with lidocaine 1%, the 2% dose provides superior intubating conditions."

After baseline hemodynamic measurement, dexmedetomidine 1 mug/kg was administered over 10 min. General anesthesia was induced with propofol 1.5 mg/kg and fentanyl 4 mug/kg 20 min after completion of dexmedetomidine infusion; the lungs were mechanically ventilated after tracheal intubation. The pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine was analyzed by a noncompartment model. Hemodynamic data and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) were measured up to 30 min after starting dexmedetomidine infusion. Sedation level was measured with the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale., RESULTS: Peak plasma concentration, area under the curve to infinity, elimination half-life, and apparent volume of distribution were significantly larger in morbidly obese than in normal weight patients (3.75 +/- 0.56 vs. 2.54 +/- 0.32 microg/l, P < 0.001; 2174 +/- 335 vs. 1594 +/- 251 ng h/l, P < 0.001; 225 +/- 55 vs. 158 +/- 53 min, P = 0.02; 310 +/- 63 vs. 164 +/- 41 l, P < 0.001, respectively). Although clearance was also higher in obese patients than in normal body weight patients (58.6 +/- 10.7 vs. 44.9 +/- 9.0 l/h, P = 0.02), it was lower in obese patients than in normal body weight patients after normalization to total body weight (0.47 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.64 +/- 0.09 l/h/kg, P < 0.001). There were no differences in systolic or diastolic blood pressure or heart rate between the two groups within the 30 min. Sedation level was deeper and SpO2 was lower in morbidly obese than in normal weight patients. More patients in the morbidly obese patient group experienced deeper sedation after the start of the dexmedetomidine infusion (P < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of dexmedetomidine are significantly different in morbidly obese patients compared with normal weight patients. Level of sedation was significantly deeper, and oxygen saturation was significantly lower, in morbidly obese than in normal weight patients, probably resulting from higher plasma concentration after infusion of 1.0 microg/kg., CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER, REGISTRY URL: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01864187), https://register.clinicaltrials.gov/prs/app/action/LoginUser?ts=1&cx=-jg9qo4 ."

RYGB surgery has been performed as one of the most common surgical treatment options for obese patients with T2DM, but the efficacy of RYGB surgery comparing with medical treatment alone has not been conclusively determined.A systematic literature search identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating RYGB surgery versus medical treatment for T2DM in obese patients was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Database, and Cochrane Clinical Trials Registry. This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The primary outcome was T2DM remission. Additional analyses comprised hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, serum lipid level, blood pressure, medication use, and adverse events. Random-effects meta-analyses were calculated and presented as weighted odds ratio (OR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Six RCTs concerning 410 total obese T2DM patients were included. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 60 months. RYGB surgery was associated with a higher T2DM remission rate (OR: 76.37, 95% CI: 20.70-281.73, P < 0.001) and serum level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD: 0.24 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.18-0.30 mmol/L, P < 0.001) than medical treatment alone. HbA1c (MD: -1.25%, 95% CI: -1.88% to -0.63%, P < 0.001), BMI (MD: -6.54 kg/m, 95% CI: -9.28 to -3.80 kg/m, P < 0.001), waist circumference (MD: -15.60 cm, 95% CI: -18.21 to -13.00 cm, P < 0.001), triglyceride (MD: -0.87 mmol/L, 95% CI: -1.17 to -0.57 mmol/L, P < 0.001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD: -0.32 mmol/L, 95% CI: -0.62 to -0.02 mmol/L, P = 0.04), systolic blood pressure (MD: -2.83 mm Hg, 95% CI: -4.88 to -0.78 mm Hg, P < 0.01) were lower after RYGB surgery. However, FPG (MD: -1.58 mmol/L, 95% CI: -3.58 to 0.41 mmol/L, P = 0.12), total cholesterol (MD: -0.40 mmol/L, 95% CI: -0.92 to 0.12 mmol/L, P = 0.13), and diastolic blood pressure (MD: 0.28 mm Hg, 95% CI: -1.89 to 2.45 mm Hg, P = 0.80) were not significantly different between the 2 treatment groups. The medicine use and quality of life were solely improved in the surgical group. Nutritional deficiencies and anemia were noted more frequently in the RYGB group.RYGB surgery is superior to medical treatment for short- to medium-term remission of T2DM, improvement of metabolic condition, and cardiovascular risk factors. Further RCTs should address the safety and long-term benefits of RYGB surgery on obese patients with T2DM."

Vasoactive substances appear to play a primary role in the regulation of portal flow. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of somatostatin and octreotide on portal pressure and plasma levels of insulin_like growth factor (IGF_1), nitric oxide (NO), endothelin_1 (ET_1) and glucagon (GLU). METHODS: Portal pressures of 14 cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension who underwent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) were directly measured via a catheter placed in the portal vein. Portal pressure and IGF_1, NO, ET_1 and GLU plasma levels were determined at baseline, and at 8 h and 24 h after administration of somatostatin or octreotide via portal vein catheter in a randomized, double_blind, cross_over design. RESULTS: The average decrease in portal pressure after intravenous infusion of somatostatin and octreotide was 9.4 +/_ 1.0 cmH2O and 5.0 +/_ 1.0 cmH2O, respectively (P < 0.01). Plasma levels of GLU and IGF_1 decreased significantly 8 and 24 h after somatostatin and octreotide infusion (P < 0.05). However, there were no significant decreases in plasma NO or ET_1 levels. There was a significant difference between somatostatin and octreotide groups (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Both somatostatin and octreotide can significantly reduce portal pressure, although somatostatin is more potent than octreotide. The underlying mechanisms may involve inhibition of the secretion of GLU, IGF_1 and other hormones as well as a decrease in hepatic metabolism and portal inflow leading to a reduction in portal pressure."

As obesity and T2DM have different disease patterns in Asians compared to Westerners, outcomes after metabolic surgery may differ. The aim of this meta-analysis was to gather the current available evidence on the outcomes after metabolic surgery in Asians., METHODS: A literature search was conducted in September 2017. Four outcome measures were examined: (1) % excess weight loss (EWL), (2) post-intervention body mass index (BMI), (3) T2DM resolution or improvement, and (4) hypertension resolution., RESULTS: Thirteen publications with a total of 1052 patients were analyzed, of which nine were randomized controlled trials, and four were case-matched studies. All the studies had a minimum follow-up duration of at least 1 year. % EWL was significantly higher in those who have undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) (SMD 0.53, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.94) versus sleeve gastrectomy (SG). T2DM resolution/improvement was favorable in those who have undergone RYGB (pooled OR 1.39, 95% CI 0.53 to 3.67) versus SG, although not statistically significant. Hypertension resolution was not significantly different between patients who have undergone SG versus RYGB (pooled OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.11)., CONCLUSION: RYGB results in better weight loss compared to SG in Asians, but the rate of T2DM resolution/improvement and improvement of hypertension appears to be similar. In Asian patients without symptoms of gastro-esophageal reflux disease in whom metabolic surgery is performed mainly for T2DM and metabolic syndrome, SG may be the surgery of choice."

Evidence from randomized controlled trials	2022	https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2021.11.016		"BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has been proven safe and effective in achieving weight loss. However, the distance from the pylorus where resection should begin has been debated., OBJECTIVES: To compare the clinical outcomes of laparoscopic SG with antrum resection (AR) versus preservation (AP) for bariatric purposes by conducting a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT)., SETTING: Academic hospital, United States., METHODS: PubMed and Cochrane Library were queried for RCTs from establishment to August 2020. The following key search terms were used: ""sleeve gastrectomy"" AND (""antrectomy"" OR ""antrum"") AND (""randomized"" OR ""random""). The following data were extracted: author, publication year, country, sample size, follow-up duration, and clinical outcomes, including weight-related: excess weight loss (EWL), total weight loss (TWL), body mass index (BMI), operation time, length of hospital stay, complication rates, and resolution of obesity-related comorbidities., RESULTS: A total of 9 unique RCTs including 492 AR and 385 AP patients were screened and included in the final quantitative analysis. Patients who underwent SG with AR showed higher EWL and TWL at 6 months (EWL: P < .001; TWL: P = .006), and 1 year (EWL: P = .013; P < .001) postoperatively. The BMI was also lower in the AR group 3 months (P = .013) and 6 months (P = .003) postoperatively. However, the EWL and BMI at 2 years were comparable between both groups (P = .222 and P = .908, respectively). No statistical significance was observed in terms of operating time, staple line disruption, bleeding, complications with a Clavien-Dindo Grade >III, resolution of comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, arthritis/back pain), and de novo gastroesophageal reflux disease (P > .05). AP was associated with a slightly shorter postoperative hospital stay (4.0 versus 3.1 days, P = .039)., CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic SG with AR is associated with superior weight loss in the short-term compared with AP. However, mid-term follow-up beyond 1 year showed no significant differences in BMI or incidence of de novo gastroesophageal reflux disease. Copyright © 2021 American Society for Bariatric Surgery.

Sweed"	Vacuum assisted closure treatment for abdominal compartment syndrome in a preterm diagnosed with necrotizing enterocolitis	2017		CN-01782643	"Background: Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (ACS) represents a natural progression of end_organ dysfunction caused by Intra_Abdominal Hypertension (IAH). The reported incidence of IAH and ACS is low in critically ill preterms, but probably under_diagnosed and often lead to death (16%_60%). The diagnosis of IAH/ACS depends on a high index of suspicion and the accurate and frequent measurement of Intra_Abdominal Pressure (IAP) in preterms at risk. The use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) dressings, also known as vacuum_assisted closure (VAC), is still uncommon in preterms. Clinical evidence of their superiority over other conventional open abdominal dressing techniques has not been evidence based proven, since available randomized trials are rare and have significant heterogeneity. The closed system generates negative pressure gradient between edematous abdomen and suction canister that promotes fluid transport, directly from abdominal cavity, and then from interstitial space of abdominal viscera, reducing their severe edema. Objectives: Describing importance of early ACS diagnosis and the efficacy of early laparotomy with abdominal VAC, in a preterm with severe Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC). Methods: Collecting data from patient files, including radiological information. Results: A preterm gestational age 28 weeks was naturally born. Birth weight was 1,223 grams and Apgar score was 9/10. His physical examination was normal and laboratory results were unremarkable. The baby received priming milk doses since age 2 days and assisted respiration was discontinued at age 3 days. On age 1 week he developed severe NEC. Under full conservative treatment with close clinical and radiological examinations free abdominal air was detected 42 hours later. He was taken for exploratory laparotomy, and necrotizing small bowel loops were found, that were removed while (Figure presented) clipping their ends rapidly, using the clip & drop technique. A protective jejunostomy was done. Post_operative course was stormy. Severe clinical problems evolved including mixed acidosis and dropping blood pressure while demanding continuing administration of sympathomimetic drugs. Acute failing renal function with evolving edema developed and became the main issue. The abdomen remained distended and ACS was suspected and confirmed due to IAP of 23 mm Hg. On recurrent abdominal operation findings included intra_abdominal clear fluid and edematous alive intestine loops. The abdomen was washed, and closed with intermittent VAC 25 mm Hg (Fig. 1). Due to improvement at all clinical and laboratory parameters the preterm was operated again on the 4th day post VAC placing. All bowel loops were found viable and mildly edematous. Three small intestine anastomosis were done, leaving a total of about 49cm small bowel. The baby suffered from short bowel syndrome that was resolved at the age of 4 months, while he was sent home weighing 3.435 kg with no other significant problems remaining. Today at 2.5 years_old he eats as a normal toddler, weighing 14 kg. There is a developmental delay and he goes to a special children daycare. Conclusions: Necrotizing Enterocolitis can be complicated by ACS so for every NEC patient a measuring IAP should be considered. When ACS is diagnosed in a neonate/preterm _ an immediate explorative laparotomy should be done, using VAC for abdominal closure."

Siddik-Sayyid"	Dexmedetomidine versus morphine for postoperative analgesia after laparoscopic bariatric surgery	2018		CN-01789110	"INTRODUCTION: Dexmedetomidine is a _2 receptor agonist with sedative and analgesic properties. During laparoscopic bariatric surgery its use may reduce postoperative opioid requirements, reduce their side effects and improve the quality of recovery. We aim to compare the effect of dexmedetomidine versus morphine bolus given prior to the end of laparoscopic bariatric surgery on opioid requirements in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). We hypothesize that the use of dexmedetomidine will reduce postoperative opioid requirements and improve quality of recovery. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized doubleblind clinical trial, 60 morbidly obese patients (BMI > 30 kg/m2) aged 18 to 60 years, undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy were randomized after informed consent to receive morphine sulfate (bolus 0.08 mg/ kg followed by a saline infusion) (Group M, n=30) or dexmedetomidine (loading dose of 1 _g/kg followed by 0.5 _g/kg/h) (Group D, n=30) thirty minutes before the end of surgery. Four patients were excluded due to morphine allergy and surgical complications requiring surgical re_exploration less than 24 hours after the initial procedure. Postoperative pain was treated using a patient controlled analgesia machine (PCA) delivering morphine. Data collected included morphine consumption in PACU (primary outcome) and at 24 hours, numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain and nausea, heart rate, blood pressure, vomiting, sedation and quality of recovery scores (QoR 40). P< 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Demographics and intraoperative data were comparable between groups except for hypertension (Table 1). There was no significant difference in morphine consumption in PACU (D 12.2 ±5.44, M 13.28 ±6.64, p=0.54) or at 24 hours (D 40.67 ±24.78, M 43.28 ±27.79, p=0.75). Intraoperative and PACU systolic pressure and heart rate results are shown in gures 1 to 4. Group D patients had more cardiovascular stability intraoperatively, during extubation and in PACU. No patient experienced hypotension (²90 mmHg systolic) or bradycardia (²60 bpm). QoR 40 scores were comparable between groups (D 157.7 ±22.62, M 165.48 ±19.19, p=014). CONCLUSIONS: Dexmedetomidine given prior to end of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy provides the same level of analgesia as morphine with better hemodynamic profile. (Figure Presented) ."

Recently, the role of the biliopancreatic limb on weight loss and co-morbidity control has gained attention because it seems to have a positive impact based on limb length. Objective(s): To compare results at 12 months of a ""standard"" (group 1) versus a long (group 2) biliopancreatic limb bypass. Biliopancreatic limbs were 50 cm and 200 cm, and alimentary limbs were 150 cm and 50 cm, respectively. Setting(s): Academic Referal Center; Mexico City; Public Seeting. Method(s): Randomized study with patients undergoing both types of surgeries at a single academic center from 2016 to 2018. The analysis included weight loss, co-morbidity control (diabetes and hypertension), biochemical panel, operative outcomes, and complications. Result(s): Two-hundred ten patients were included (105 in each group). Almost all data were homogenous at baseline. Female sex comprised 86.1% of cases, with a mean body mass index of 43.5 kg/m2. Excess weight loss (77.6 +/- 15.7% versus 83.6 +/- 16.7%; P = .011) and total weight loss (33.5 +/- 6.4% versus 37.1 +/- 7.1%; P < .001) was higher in group 2; better HbA1C levels were also observed. Co-morbidity outcomes, operative data, and complications were similar between groups. Conclusion(s): The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with 200 cm of biliopancreatic limb length induces more weight loss at 12 months than a 50 cm limb length. Better HbA1C levels were also observed, but similar effects on co-morbidities and complications were noted.Copyright © 2021 American Society for Bariatric Surgery"

Wu"	Effects of Proximal and Distal Enteral Glucose Infusion on Cardiovascular Response in Health and Type 2 Diabetes	2020	10.1210/clinem/dgaa341	CN-02133060	"CONTEXT: Exposure of the small intestine to nutrients frequently leads to marked reductions in blood pressure (BP) in type 2 diabetes (T2DM). It remains unclear whether the region of the gut exposed to nutrients influences postprandial cardiovascular responses. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cardiovascular responses to proximal and distal small intestinal glucose infusion in health and T2DM. DESIGN: Double_blind, randomized, crossover design. SETTING: Single center in Australia. PATIENTS: 10 healthy subjects and 10 T2DM patients. INTERVENTIONS: Volunteers were studied on 2 occasions, when a transnasal catheter was positioned with infusion ports opening 13 cm and 190 cm beyond the pylorus. A 30_g bolus of glucose was infused into either site and 0.9% saline into the alternate site over 60 minutes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: BP, heart rate (HR), and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) blood flow were measured over 180 minutes. RESULTS: Systolic BP was unchanged in response to both infusions in health, but decreased in T2DM, with a greater reduction after proximal versus distal infusion (all P ² .01). The increment in HR did not differ between treatments in health, but was greater after distal versus proximal infusion in T2DM (P = .02). The increases in SMA blood flow were initially greater, but less sustained, with proximal versus distal infusion in health (P < .001), a pattern less evident in T2DM. CONCLUSIONS: In T2DM, postprandial hypotension may be mitigated by diversion of nutrients from the proximal to the distal small intestine."

The purpose of this study is using dynamic parameters (provided by the Vigileo FloTrac system) to evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of goal directed fluid therapy (GDFT) in the perioperative period for plateau_elderly gastrointestinal cancer patients. This prospective, randomized and controlled study was conducted among 88 participants from Yun_Gui Plateau of China, aged over 60 years, undergoing elective radical correction of gastrointestinal cancer. They were randomly allocated into two equal groups: GDFT group, using FloTrac/Vigileo system to obtain blood flow dynamic indices Visual analog scale; routine fluid infusion group (control group), routine fluid infusion according to blood pressure during the surgery. Surveillance indicators contained the following contents: the total fluid infusion volume, the amount of crystalloid and colloid, the urine output, the blood loss volume, the time of first bowel movement after surgery, the postoperative discharge time and the medical care costs. The crystalloid quantity infused in GDFT group was markedly less than that in control group [(1269.32 ± 332.4) vs (1670.45 ± 348.8) ml, P < 0.05]. The colloid quantity infused in GDFT group was significantly more than that in control group [(892.64 ± 413.87) vs (1140.91 ± 271.36) ml, P < 0.01]. The incidence of pulmonary complications post of the operation in GDFT group was much lower. In GDFT group, the first time of intestinal peristalsis was substantially earlier than that in control group [(81.51 ± 33.2) vs (107.66 ± 31.81) min, P < 0.05]. Moreover, the hospitalization days after surgery in GDFT group were much shorter than that in control group. Medical cost in GDFT group was much lower than that in control group. In conclusion, GDFT used in the perioperative period could improve the prognosis of old patients undergoing radical correction of gastrointestinal cancers and reduce the incidence of postoperative complications. On the other hand, patients with this treatment will be happy for cost savings."
H. Zhao and L. Jiao	Comparative analysis for the effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass vs sleeve gastrectomy in patients with morbid obesity: Evidence from 11 randomized clinical trials (meta-analysis)	2019	https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2019.11.013		"BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) are the most common procedures performed during bariatric surgery and both of them have been demonstrated having significant efficacy for morbid obesity. However, the comparative analysis of the effect of them has not been well studied. Thus, this comparative analysis was conducted to determine whether LRYGB and LSG are equivalent for mid- and long-term weight loss, resolution of comorbidities and adverse events (AEs)., METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases up to January 1, 2019 for studies that investigated LRYGB and LSG with respect to weight loss outcomes, resolution of comorbidities and AEs. Standardised mean differences (SMDs) and risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to compare the outcomes of the groups. Two reviewers assessed the quality of the trials and extracted the data independently. All statistical analyses were performed using the standard statistical procedures in Review Manager 5.2., RESULTS: We included 11 studies (N = 1,328 participants) in this meta-analysis. Our results showed no significant difference in excess weight loss between LRYGB and LSG, with a pooled SMD of -0.16 (95% CI: -0.52-0.19; P = 0.36). Further, the pooled results showed no significant difference in midterm and long-term weight loss between the comparative groups. Similarly, no significant difference was found in T2DM resolution. The pooled results indicate that patients receiving LSG experienced fewer postoperative complications and reoperation rate, with pooled RRs of 1.66 (95% CI: 1.33-2.07; P < 0.00001) and 1.73 (95% CI: 1.14-2.62; P = 0.01). LRYGB may be superior to LSG in dyslipidemia, hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) remission., CONCLUSIONS: The present meta-analysis indicated that both LRYGB and LSG are equivalent for excess weight loss and T2DM resolution. However, patients receiving LSG experienced fewer postoperative complications and reoperation rate than those who underwent LRYGB. LRYGB may be superior in dyslipidemia, hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) remission. Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier Ltd."

Kashyap"	Impact of weight loss trajectory following randomization to bariatric surgery on long-term diabetes glycemic and cardiometabolic parameters	2019	https://dx.doi.org/10.4158/EP-2018-0522		"Objective: It is unclear whether acute weight loss or the chronic trajectory of weight loss after bariatric surgery is associated with long-term type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) glycemic improvement. This ancillary study of the Surgical Treatment and Medications Potentially Eradicate Diabetes Efficiently (STAMPEDE) trial aimed to answer this question. Method(s): In STAMPEDE, 150 patients with T2DM were randomized to bariatric surgery, and 96 had 5-year follow-up. Data post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB, n = 49) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG, n = 47) were analyzed. We defined percent weight loss in the first year as negative percent decrease from baseline weight to lowest weight in the first year. Percent weight regain was positive percent change from lowest weight in the first year to fifth year. Weight change was then correlated with cardiometabolic (CM) and glycemic outcomes at 5 years using Spearman rank correlations and multivariate analysis. Result(s): In both RYGB and SG, less weight loss in the first year positively correlated with higher 5-year glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (RYGB, beta = +0.13; P<.001 and SG, beta = 0.14; P<.001). In SG, greater weight regain from nadir positively correlated with higher HbA1c (beta = 0.06; P = .02), but not in RYGB. Reduced first-year weight loss was also correlated with increased 5-year triglycerides (beta = 1.81; P = .01), but not systolic blood pressure. Weight regain did not correlate with CM outcomes. Conclusion(s): Acute weight loss may be more important for T2DM glycemic control following both RYGB and SG as compared with weight regain. Clinicians should aim to assist patients with achieving maximal weight loss in the first year post-op to maximize long-term health of patients.Copyright © 2019 AACE."
