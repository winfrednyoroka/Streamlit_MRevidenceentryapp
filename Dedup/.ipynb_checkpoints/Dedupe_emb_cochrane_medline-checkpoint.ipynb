    "# Deduplication of records\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aim\n",
    "To identify and get rid of duplicates using Dedupe in addition to using endnote to remove duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method\n",
    "Import the records retrieved from Cochrane, Medline and Embase to the Endnote.\n",
    "Use the find duplicates functionality in endnote to identify duplicates and remove them.\n",
    "Export the remaining records in form of excel output style for further screening for duplicates using dedupe library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Install and load/import the preferred libraries including pandas and dedupe.\n",
    "Read in the dataset using pandas on jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the pandas_dedupe  function to parse the dataframe and a subset of column headers including **title, year and accessionnumbers** for scoring of the training dataset. Where I am presented with yes, no, unsure to confirm from the select columns whether two entries are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finish option is to provided to stop the assignment of clusters in the training subset and it does score the other records for similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output\n",
    "The output of this is a csv file and json file containing the training dataset for future reference.\n",
    "The csv file contains two additional columns including clusterid which is unique for unique records and similar in cases where the algorithm scored that to be the same. The second column shows the confidence level with which the algorithm has assigned the entries to different clusters.\n"
